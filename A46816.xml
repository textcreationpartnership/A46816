            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.10. <hi>Thy friend, and thy fathers friend forſake not;</hi> that is, uſe all good means to keep and preſerve ſuch a friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such a friend have you always approved your ſelf to the Author of theſe Annotations, and all his Family: and on that account I am forc'd to think my ſelf obliged to take this opportunity of teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my grateful ſenſe of ſuch Friendſhip, by preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you theſe Annotations, tho I know they would otherwiſe have been valued and made uſe of

for the Authors, as well as your own ſake; towards whom, and all his, you have inherited a moſt kind and affectionate Friendſhip from your Worthy and Pious Father deceaſed, and your yet ſurviving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently Holy Mother, who is as great an inſtance of a religious, humble, uniform, perſevering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as any I know. I am ſure I need ſay nothing to inhance the value you have for the Authors Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; whoſe true, plain hearted, Cordial, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Friendſhip, I have ſo often heard you mention with a great reſentment of his loſs. But I may not forbear gratefully to take notice of your conſtant and frequent Viſits of the Authors Widow, my moſt dear Mother, notwithſtanding the infirmities of her age hath rendred her unable to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the greatneſs of your kindneſs.

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE main cauſe why theſe <hi>Annotations,</hi> which were by the Author in his life-time fairly tranſcribed with his own hand fit for the Preſs, do come abroad ſo long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe, is becauſe ſome quires of the Copy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parted from the reſt, were miſlay'd, and not found again for many years. I ſuppoſe the Authors Prefaces to the former Volumes, do diſcharge me from any need of giving the Reader an account of them, or directions how they may be made moſt uſeful to thoſe of ordinary capacities, to ſerve whoſe ſpiritual intereſt they were chiefly deſigned, and towards whom, eſpecially the younger and more baſhful perſons, he did always exerciſe a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary winning and encouraging freedom in his whole converſe, having no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that moroſe auſterity and reſervedneſs for which ſome good men have been blamed, and which oft-times hinders thoſe who moſt need it, from deſiring and receiving direction and aſſiſtance from their Spiritual Guides. And therefore I have only to recommend them to the Chriſtian Readers ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peruſal, and humbly to beg the bleſſing of the Lord upon them.</p>
            <p>There is only one ſervice which I find many good people judg I owe to the Memory of my moſt endeared Father, and that is, to give ſome brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome ſuch paſſages of his life as may be thought worthy a remark; wherein I ſhall be religiouſly careful to mention nothing but what I know, or have abundant ground to be aſſured of its truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arthur Jackſon</hi> was born in <hi>Little Waldingfield</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>John Jackſon</hi> a Spaniſh Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> dyed when he was young; his Mother afterwards married Sir <hi>Tho. Crooke,</hi> Baronet, who carried her into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where ſhe dyed. He was by his Guardian Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Jackſon</hi> of <hi>Broomfield</hi> in <hi>Edmunton,</hi> carried to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and placed in <hi>Trinity Colledg,</hi> but under the Tuition of one ſo little minding the faithful diſcharge of that great Work he undertook, that I have often heard him ſay, He might have been half a year abſent, and his Tutor not
<pb facs="tcp:42788:5"/>
known it. But by the Grace of God he was betimes engaged in a way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, conſtant, and reſolved ſtudiouſneſs, ſeldom ſtudying leſs than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen hours in a day, for the firſt three or four years, as I have heard him ſometimes declare; and then I ſuppoſe he took up that courſe of riſing at three or four a clock ſummer and winter, which he practiſed ever ſince I can remember, and till his death; being ſcarce ever, when well, in bed at ſix a clock, unleſs peruſing his Notes; and indeed he was at <hi>73</hi> as fit and willing for his work as at <hi>40;</hi> his ſight ſo good, that without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles he could read the ſmalleſt Greek print in his ſtudy by Moon light; but ſo ſhort-ſighted, that he could not diſtinguiſh his friends when he met them in the ſtreets; which occaſioned many perſons, who were not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, to think his not returning their civil ſalutes to be out of pride or ſlighting, when 'twas only his not ſeeing them occaſioned his paſſing by them unſaluted. He continued ſome time in the Colledg after he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts, till he married <hi>Mary</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of Mr. <hi>Tho. Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nert</hi> of <hi>Stoneberry</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> with whom he lived <hi>47</hi> years in great endearment of mutual love, by whom he had three ſons and five daughters; and who, with two ſons and two daughters do yet ſurvive him. He was married in the year <hi>1619;</hi> not long after he was choſen by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Michael's Woodſtreet</hi> to be their Lecturer, and (after the death of Mr. <hi>Bragden</hi>) their Paſtour. When the great Sickneſs came in <hi>1624.</hi> he ſent his Wife and Children to her Father, and continued himſelf in the City, diſcharging all the Offices and Duties of a faithful Paſtor to his flock, being content to hazard his own life to ſerve the neceſſities of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſouls; often viſiting perſons infected with that ſad diſeaſe; in which good and holy work the Lord did wonderfully preſerve him from all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when thouſands fell on either hand of him. I remember to have heard him relate, how a Countrey Miniſter being to preach for him, deſired he might ſit where he might not be near any that were or had been infected. To whom he anſwered, <hi>Alas Sir! I wonder you will come to the City, if you be ſo fearful of the Sickneſs; for you cannot walk the ſtreets, nor come into any company, but you meet thoſe who are or have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi> And the next tidings he heard of him, was his death of the plague. He preached conſtantly twice on the Lords day, and likewiſe catechiſed the children before Sermon, and repeated the Sermon in his Family, to which many of his hearers did reſort; and in <hi>Lent</hi> always ſpent ſome hours in the Church two days every week in examining and inſtructing the men and maid-ſervants, and others, to fit and prepare them for the Lords Supper; the benefit of which I know ſome yet alive that uſe to mention with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God and him; and indeed in Catechising he had ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faculty, that he did not only profit but pleaſe; ſo that ſome who at
<pb facs="tcp:42788:5"/>
first came with great unwillingneſs, were ſo affected with his ſerious, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and familiar way, that afterwards they were eagerly deſirous to go; and ſome have declared, they never went any whither with more pleaſure, than to him on that account. He likewiſe Preached every Holy-day for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, being deſirous to help Servants, and others, to improve that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they then had, for the beſt and highect purpoſes; in which courſes the Lord was pleaſed to give him many Seals to his Miniſtry, by the converſion of many from their ſin and folly unto the Lord, to whom he was a true ſpiritual Father.

<pb facs="tcp:42788:6"/>
ſince he came among them. Then he was choſe to <hi>Wapping,</hi> and proffered Sixſcore pound a year and an houſe; but his old Neighbours prevailed with him to ſtay with them upon their promiſing 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year; but in two years time they fell ſhort ſo far, that his Friends that moſt deſired his ſtay, were forc'd to perſuade him to accept of any other Offer; which being known, he was ſoon after called to be their Paſtor, by the Inhabitants of <hi>Faiths</hi> under <hi>Pauls;</hi> where he continued preaching twice every Lords day (except when about ſeventeen weeks in the <hi>Fleet</hi> for refusing to ſwear before that which was then called <hi>An High Court of Juſtice</hi>) till <hi>Aug. 44. 1662.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon his Majeſties Return he was choſen by the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Bible to Him in his firſt paſſage through the City; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a ſhort gratulatory ſpeech; to which his Majeſty made that pious and gracious Anſwer, taking the Bible into his hands, <hi>This is the Book which I ſhall make the Rule of my Government, and the Rule of my Life.</hi> In both places of his fixed Miniſtry he had a great and ſpecial care of young perſons, uſing not only common and publick, but private and peculiar means of engaging their Souls to, and ſtrengthning, and <hi>truly confirming</hi> them in real holineſs, goodneſs, and religion; and therefore did perſwade, and prevail with ſeveral of the most ſerious and conſidering young men, both married and unmarried, to meet weekly together, and by prayer, and holy conference, to stir up, and provoke one another to a good and holy life, he himſelf often meeting with them, and praying with and for them, adviſing them how to manage the work for their Souls beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and cautioning them againſt thoſe ſpiritual evils which are apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and creep into the most holy performances. And that their diſcourſes might be the more uſeful, he adviſed them at one meeting to propound a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, of which at the next each of them gave ſuch account as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do; the benefit of which, many of them have often, and ſtill do with great affection and thankfulneſs, remember and mention. And indeed I find the Learned and Worthy Dr. <hi>Simon Patrick,</hi> at the cloſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at the Funeral of his indeared Friend, Mr. <hi>Samuel Jacombe,</hi> taking notice of this courſe, as a ſingular remark of Mr. <hi>Jacomb</hi>'s early piety, and a good means of promoting Religion in the Souls of young perſons: and I doubt not bat he ſpake his own experience, when he ſaith of it, <hi>The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which ſome can to this day remember;</hi> which beneficial thing, I hope he doth ſtill continue to promote, in thoſe great advantages and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which his preſent circumstances put into his hands. After Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> was diſcharged from publick Service, he retired into the Country, firſt to <hi>Hadly,</hi> near <hi>Barnet,</hi> and after to his eldest Son, at <hi>Edmunton,</hi> Being at <hi>Hadly</hi> in the Sickneſs-year, ſome of his late
<pb facs="tcp:42788:6"/>
Neighbours of <hi>Faiths</hi> Pariſh gave him a Viſit; and bewailing that their Miniſter had left them, he readily profered to come and preach among them, if they could procure liberty for him; which they ſomething confidently promiſed themſelves, but could by no means prevail. When the <hi>Oxford,</hi> or Five-mile-Act came forth, he ſeemed troubled to leave <hi>London,</hi> where he had been above Forty years a Miniſter; but upon prayer, and ſerious conſideration of the terms required, he could not ſatisfie his mind, and came to a reſolution of patient bearing what might befall him; after which, he was much unconcerned, uſing <hi>Luther</hi>'s Expreſſion, <hi>I ſhall have a place ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Heaven, or in Heaven.</hi> In the Country he ſpent moſt of his time in compleating theſe Annotations. He had gone as far as the third Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when the Providence of God called him from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to his eternal reſt. His diſtemper was the <hi>Stone in the Kidneys,</hi> of which bitter cup he had often taſted, by divers ſharp fits, with voiding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stones: His first fit was at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whither he went to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Printing the Annotations on the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> his laſt fit ſurpriz'd him in his Study, as he reach'd down a Book from a Shelf; with which ſtraining himſelf, a Stone in his Kidney was diſ-lodged, and at the entrance into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ritory, gave him great and ſharp pains for Three or Four hours; but then it ſtopt, and the violence of the pain went over, and could never, by all the means were uſed, be brought again. I well remember when I came to ſee him, he told me, he was in the condition of a travailing woman, whoſe pain was gone from her; and putting his finger to the place, ſaid, <hi>haeret lateris lethalis arundo;</hi> and ſo indeed it proved. After about a weeks uſe of means in the Country, he went to <hi>London,</hi> to his loving friend Mr. <hi>Thomas Major,</hi> who then lived in <hi>Milkſtreet,</hi> and did ſucceed his Father in a moſt loving and hearty reſpect to him, who had been to them both a loving and faithful Friend and Paſtor. When he entred his houſe, he ſaid to him, I am come now, not to preach to you, but die with you. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained his Friends to the last with ſuch undiſturbed diſcourſe, that they hardly believed him ſo ill as indeed he was. The day before his deceaſe, he walked about the Room, and diſcourſed with ſeveral Chriſtian Friends, who came to pay him their laſt Reſpects, in outward appearance, as if he ailed nothing, but reckoning himſelf a dying Man, and declaring the ſame to them. When he perceived any weeping for him, he would ſmilingly ſay, <hi>They were fools to weep to ſee an old man die.</hi> When his Wife asked him, if he were willing to leave her, he ſaid, he would not leave her for all the World; but ſhe could not expect but that after ſo long ſtriving for a Crown, he ſhould be willing to receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. All his friends obſerved a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene compoſed temper of Spirit in him, during his illneſs. He much perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:42788:7"/>
them to practiſe what he had taught them, aſſuring them they were the Truths of God. To ſome he expreſſed much ſatisfaction in his Spirit as to his Non-Conformity; profeſſing he had many times asked God forgiveneſs on his knees, for his former errors and miſtakes in thoſe things. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>London</hi> about a Week, in the uſe of means; from which the Lord was pleaſed to withhold his bleſſing. The night in which he died, he called for his Children which were then in the houſe, and told them he was dying; and bid them ſee if their Mother were awake, he deſired to ſee her, but would not have her awakened, for fear of frighting her; for he thought he ſhould live till ſhe waked: ſhe coming ſoon to him, he ſpake chearfully to her, thanking her for all her former kindneſs; ſhewed them how wet and cold his Stomach was, ſaying, it was an up-hill way; it is hard work to die: but did not much bemoan himſelf. He found Death creeping on him by degrees, and could tell thoſe about him, <hi>Now this leg is dead,</hi> and then the other. Having a Cordial offered him, he put it by, and ſmiling, ſaid, he would have no revivings now, tho before he had never refuſed any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Soon after he ſaid, <hi>Lord deliver, deliver me; for I cannot bear this:</hi> and the Lord heard, and anſwered his prayer; for immediately he gaſped out his laſt breath, and was dead, before one could go croſs the Room. He departed in the morning of the Lords day, about Four of the Clock, <hi>Aug. 5.</hi> juſt that day month before the dreadful Fire of <hi>London;</hi> whereby he was taken from the ſight of that evil, which would have been a very great affliction to him, in regard of the very many Friends and Acquaintance he had in the City; the weight of whoſe ſufferings would have lain very much upon his heart, he being known to be of a very tender and compaſſionate Spirit towards his Friends in any of their ſufferings; which he did on all occaſions expreſs, not only in words, but in free and liberal aſſiſtance. In a word, He was a faithful and painful Paſtor, a plain-hearted, cordial, compaſſionate Friend, a tender and affectionate Husband, a moſt loving and careful Father, full of natural affection, and very indulgent to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren in every thing but what was evil, and there ſtrict and ſevere; a great lover and promoter of peace and holineſs, and ſo generally well ſpoken of by all, tho of different Judgments and Opinions, that a ſtranger once told him ſmiling, That he feared he was not good, becauſe every body ſpake well of him; and indeed he was of ſo inoffenſive a converſe in the World, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the diſcharge of his Miniſterial duty, where he was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſin and ſinners, he was hugely careful to give no man occaſion to be angry with him; and would rather ſuffer a great wrong, than but ſeem to do any.</p>

                  <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ordinary Teachers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. God was often pleaſed, eſpecially in thoſe times when the Prieſts grew corrupt and neglected their duty, to raiſe up out of any other of the Tribes, Prophets, who were called and gifted, and acted by Gods Spirit, and ſent forth to teach the People, and to make known the Will of God unto them in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way; yea and ſome of theſe at the laſt God made uſe of as his Penmen for the writing of part of the Canonical Scripture, to wit, the following Books of the four greater, and the twelve leſſer Prophets, as they are commonly called; which are therefore frequently mentioned in the New Teſtament, as of equal authority with the Books of the Law, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them

               </p>
               <p>It is commonly ſaid by Interpreters, that after the Prophets had propheſied or preached unto the people, they uſed to write the Sum of their Prophecies or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and affix them to the doors of the Temple, which after ſome time were by the Prieſts removed from thence, and laid up in the Temple, as a part of the ſacred Canon. But of this there is no certainty, nor any great probability, conſidering how ill affected the Prieſts were to the prophecying of the Prophets in thoſe days; only that they by divine appointment committed their Prophecies to writing, for the uſe of the Church, is unqueſtionably clear. <hi>John</hi> 1.45. <hi>We have found him of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Law, and the Prophets did write;</hi> to which ſome refer thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.8. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.2. where the Prophets are enjoyned to write their Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for this our Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it is not without cauſe that his Prophecy is ſet in the firſt place; for, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By that which is noted afterwards concerning the time of his Prophecying, it is evident that he was one of the firſt of the Prophets, if not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the firſt of them all. And 2. Beſides that <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſending ſo many noble Perſons to him, to acquaint him with the Letters which <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> had written to them, and to deſire his prayers for them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.2. is a clear evidence that he was a Prophet of great Authority and Eſteem in his time; even his Prophecy it ſelf is juſtly eſteemed to be of greateſt eminency, not only for the variety of his Viſions, and the incomparable Majeſty of his Style, (which ſhews that he was a man learned and eloquent, and that it was not without good effect that his lips were touched by a Seraphim with a fiery coal taken from the Altar, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.6, 7.) but eſpecially becauſe there are therein more clear and remarkable Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, than in all the Prophets beſides; whence it is that he is oftner cited by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, than any of the reſt; and that the firſt Text which we find that Chriſt preached upon, was taken out of his Prophecy, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17, 18. And the Fathers do uſually upon this account call him <hi>the Evangelical Prophet,</hi> yea and ſometimes <hi>the fift Evangeliſt;</hi> ſo that in this regard his Name <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>the Salvation of the Lord,</hi> did notably ſuit with the Doctrine which he taught. As for that which is ſaid 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.22. that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did write the Acts of <hi>Uzziah</hi> firſt and laſt, ſee the Note there.</p>

                  <hi>The Son of</hi> Amoz.] This may ſeem to have been added purpoſely to diſtinguiſh this our Prophet from ſome other Perſon or Perſons that were in his time called by the ſame Name; for that this <hi>Amoz</hi> the Father of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> is altogether improbable; becauſe the Name of <hi>Amos</hi> the Prophet is in the Hebrew written with other Letters than this is; neither is there any good ground for that which is laid down as a general Rule by the Rabbins, that where any Prophet hath his Father mentioned together with him, there both Father and Son were Prophets. And as for that which the Jewiſh Doctors do alſo commonly affirm, that this <hi>Amos,</hi> the Father of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was the Son of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Which he ſaw concerning</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem] That is, the State and People of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> (under which the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was comprehended) and the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> who are particularly mentioned, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Metropolis of that Kingdom, but alſo becauſe in bad times it was moſt diſordered, and from thence all wickedneſs did ſpread it ſelf all the Land over. It is true indeed, that there are many things ſpoken in this Prophecy, concerning other Nations, yet it is called <hi>The Viſion of</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>which he ſaw concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, becauſe it chiefly concerns them, and that which is inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning other Nations, is mentioned with reſpect to their inſtruction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Benefit.</p>

                  <hi>In the days of</hi> Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <hi>and</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>Kings of</hi> Judah.] Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Jotham</hi> Reigned ſixteen years, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.33. and <hi>Ahaz</hi> as many, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.2. And that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecied all the time of both their Reigns, as is here expreſſed; and conſidering that of the nine and twenty years of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.2. he had Reigned at leaſt fifteen years when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent to reprove him for that vain-glorious Act of his, in ſhewing his Treaſures to the Babylonian Embaſſadors, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.14. (for in his foregoing Sickneſs, which occaſioned the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe Embaſſadors to him, God had promiſed that he ſhould live fifteen years longer, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.6.) it is clear that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecied under the Reign of theſe three Kings, at leaſt ſeven and forty years. And how many years longer he might prophecy, both in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after the coming of the Babylonian Embaſſadors to him, and before that under the Reign of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> in whoſe days it is here ſaid he begun to Prophecy, cannot be certainly concluded: For though ſome would conclude, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> began not to Prophecy till the laſt year of <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s Reign, becauſe there is a Viſion mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. which he ſaw <hi>in the Year that King</hi> Uzziah <hi>died,</hi> at which time when God had ſaid, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> &amp;c. the Prophet anſwered, <hi>Here am I, ſend me;</hi> yet the truth is, that this cannot be juſtly gathered from thence, becauſe that might not be intended of his firſt Call to his Prophetical Office, but of that particular meſſage which God required him at that time to deliver to the Jews; concerning which, ſee the Notes there.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh Doctors do indeed affirm, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was put to death in the days of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> being ſawn aſunder with a Wooden Saw; whereto ſome Expoſitors conceive, the Apoſtle had reſpect in the mention that he makes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. of ſome that <hi>were ſawn aſunder.</hi> And if this could be taken for granted, it would be clear that he prophecied ſome conſiderable time, above threeſcore years; for beſides the time that he ſhould have Prophecied under <hi>Uzziah</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the two and thirty years of <hi>Jotham</hi>'s and <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s Reigns, and the nine and twenty years of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, do together make up ſixty one years. But the truth is, that this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition concerning the death of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is altogether groundleſs, and not much to be regarded; for that this was not done in the days of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> appears by this, that there is no mention here made of his Prophecying in <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s time; and how unlikely it was that he ſhould be ſo cruelly put to death in the days of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> we may eaſily conceive. That which is moſt obſervable here is, that it is clear that he was contemporary with <hi>Hoſea, Amos,</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> who were of the firſt of the Prophets; and that notwithſtanding he did faithfully diſcharge his duty ſo long a time amongſt Gods people, yet it was with very little ſucceſs, as

The whole frame of the World, the Heavens and the Earth, and all the Creatures therein, are ſummoned to hear the following ſad complaint which the Lord makes concerning his People; and that to imply, 1. The ſtupidity of Gods People, that the ſenſleſs Creatures were more like to hear him than they were: ſee the Note, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2. 2. That theſe Creatures, by which he had done much good for his People, might well bear witneſs on Gods behalf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their horrid ingratitude: ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.26.

                  <hi>They have forſaken the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by a general diſregard of his commands, by ſerving other Gods, and by an open renouncing of the true Religion. <hi>They have provoked the Holy One of Iſrael unto anger,</hi> that is, they have done exceeding wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, as if they purpoſely intended to provoke God to anger; <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> (a title which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> frequently gives to the Lord), that God who is infinitely holy, and that had manifeſted himſelf to be ſuch to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by his anger againſt them for their ſins, and many other ways, thereby making known that he expected that they whom he had choſen to be his peculiar people, ſhould be in that regard a holy people. <hi>They are gone away backward,</hi> that is, they have abſolutely turned away from the Lord like ſtubborn children or ſervants, that diſliking the commands of their Parents or Maſters, turn their backs in diſdain upon them, and fling way; or like reſty Jades, who the more they are driven forward, the more they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

good what he had ſaid, that it would be to no purpoſe to ſmite them any more; which may ſeem the more probable too, becauſe the mention that is made in the next verſe of <hi>wounds and bruiſes,</hi> doth beſt ſuit with this Expoſition; and becauſe that which follows, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Your Country is deſolate,</hi> &amp;c. ſeems to be added by way of explaining this Metaphor. And accordingly I conceive, that comparing the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> here to the body of a man that is all over dangerouſly beaten and bruiſed, becauſe <hi>the head and the heart</hi> are principal and vital parts, upon which the health of the whole body doth chiefly depend, therefore they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned here.

See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. As that their Neighbours and Confederates never minded to afford them any relief, ſo neither had they power or skill to help themſelves; and as for that which was the only ſure way to cure them of their evils, namely, their turning to the Lord by unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repentance, that was never minded, but they obſtinately ran on ſtill in their ſins, and that either becauſe they whoſe work it was to have adminiſtred theſe means of their cure, neglected their duty, or elſe becauſe the people would not follow their direction.

Yea and ſome that read it in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Your Country is deſolate,</hi> &amp;c. do yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the deſolation which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhould make in the land, and conceive that it is expreſſed as done already, only to ſhew how certainly it ſhould be. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems far moſt probable that the Prophet ſtill proceeds to ſhew that God had proceeded ſo far in a way of puniſhing them, that it was in vain to ſmite them any more, therefore I conceive it is beſt rendered in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Your Country is deſolate, your Cities are burnt with fire;</hi> and that it muſt be underſtood of deſolations paſt or preſent, when the Prophet ſpake this, to wit, of the devaſtations made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Tiglath-Pileſer</hi> in the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Jothams</hi> days, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. or by <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now eſpecially this is meant of that Spiritual juriſdiction and dominion he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in the Conſciences of his people, to wit, that by the Scepter of his Goſpel, <hi>(that Law and Word of the Lord</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe, that was to <hi>go forth out of Zion),</hi> he ſhould rule and govern as a juſt King, not amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but amongſt the Gentiles alſo, and ſhould ſubdue their hearts to the obedience of his Kingdom, and then acquit and abſolve them from all their ſins. See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 110.2, 3, 6. And therefore it is added, <hi>and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke many people;</hi> which I conceive is alſo principally meant of his convincing them of their ſins, and the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. whereby they ſhould be brought to give up their names to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, &amp;c.]</hi> The meaning is, that the converted Nations living as is before ſaid, under the Government of Chriſt, though formerly warring continually one againſt another, and ſeeking to devour and deſtroy one another, ſhould live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably together, and laying by all thoughts and deſires of being hurtful and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious one to another, ſhould only betake themſelves to ſuch imployments as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the publick good, and whereby they ſhould rather promote the welfare, than the hurt one of another. For as by way of foretelling times of War it is ſaid, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.10. <hi>Beat your Plow-ſhares into ſwords, and your pruning-hooks into ſpears,</hi> ſo here on the contrary by way of foretelling the concord and peace which the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould work amongſt men, it is ſaid, <hi>that they ſhould beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks.</hi> And this is alſo more fully expreſt in the following words, <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> All the difficulty indeed is how to reconcile this Prophecy with the bitter Wars that have been in moſt times, even amongſt thoſe that have profeſſed themſelves the Church of Chriſt, with reſpect whereto our Saviour gave that warning to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend peace on the earth, I came not to ſend peace but a ſword.</hi> Some to avoid this difficulty hold this to be only a Prophecy of that Univerſal Peace which ſhould be in the reign of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> amongſt the Nations throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, who had then the greateſt part of the World under their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, juſt about the time of our Saviours birth; the truth whereof, as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, ſo it may be probably gathered from that Tax, or Muſter mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Then went out a Decree from Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed;</hi> which could not well be, but in a time of a general Peace. And again, others would have it to be only a figurative expreſſion of that true, inward, ſpiritual peace, which is the effect of Chriſts Kingdom in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Believers, begun here, but perfected hereafter in Heavenly glory. But queſtionleſs the words are clearly a Prediction of that concord and peace, which ſhould be the proper effect of the Goſpel amongſt thoſe Nations, and particular perſons, that ſhould ſincerely ſubmit themſelves to the Government of Chriſt. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42788:19"/>
Doctrine of the Goſpel doth upon many grounds preſs Chriſtians to live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as far as they are able, with all men whatſoever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all men:</hi> and, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men.</hi> And eſpecially that they ſhould live lovingly and peaceably amongſt themſelves, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.50. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.3. And accordingly we find that where people are throughly brought to that frame and diſpoſition of ſpirit which the Law of the Goſpel doth require in Chriſtians, they are ſo harmleſs and meek, that they are careful not to wrong any with whom they converſe, but are content rather quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer wrong from others, and will live as brethren lovingly and peaceably together, without any jars and variance; as it is noted of thoſe that were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church in the firſt days of the Goſpel, who were at leaſt five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, if not eight thouſand, <hi>that the multitude of thoſe that believed were of one heart, and of one ſoul.</hi> And this is that which is here foretold concerning ths days of the Goſpel. It cannot therefore be inferred from hence, that it is altogether unlawful for Chriſtians to make war, whether offenſive or defenſive; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have gone out to war by Gods own appointment. And when the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were converted to the faith of Chriſt by the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtry, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the queſtion to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.14. <hi>And what ſhall we do?</hi> He did not enjoin them to leave their calling, but only inſtructed them how to behave themſelves therein, <hi>Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any man falſly, and be content with your wages.</hi> Juſt wars are rather executions of Juſtice, than any breach of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity. Nor muſt we think that the diſcord and wars that have been in all ages, even in the days of the Goſpel, and that too amongſt thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, do any way weaken the truth of this Prophecy; for the drift of theſe expreſſions of the Prophet is only to ſhew, firſt, how much the Goſpel ſhould tend to the eſtabliſhing of a happy Peace amongſt the Nations of the World, that had been before ſo barbarouſly ready to devour one another, by bringing them to be united together in one faith, as fellow-members of one and the ſame body under Chriſt their head, <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. And, 2. what intire affection and union of ſpirit, and ſo what a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition one towards another, there ſhould be amongſt thoſe that were true Chriſtians, that did ſincerely ſubmit to the Law of Chriſt, <hi>the Goſpel of Peace, Epheſ.</hi> 6.15. and that were effectually guided by the Spirit of Chriſt. All which notwithſtanding it needs not ſeem ſtrange to us, that the Church is ſtill ſo much embroiled with war: 1. Becauſe when the Church is for peace, her enemies will ſtill be for perſecution and war. 2. Becauſe there will be ſtill in the Church ſo many that profeſs Chriſt, but in their works deny him, not being Chriſtians indeed. And, 3ly, becauſe even thoſe that are true-hearted Chriſtians, by reaſon of the remainders of corruption in them, are over-ready too often to ſwerve from the temper and way of peace which Chriſt hath preſcribed them.</p>
               <p>V. 5. <hi>O houſe of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord.]</hi> As in imitation of that expreſſion wherewith <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he had ſaid the converted Gentiles ſhould encourage one another, <hi>Come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> the Prophet doth here exhort the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they that were Gods firſt-born peculiar people, would not come behind them, but would rather prevent them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42788:19"/>
and lead them the way. Since the whole world ſhould be enlightned, it were a ſhame if they ſhould ſtill walk in darkneſs; <hi>O houſe of Jacob come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord,</hi> that is, in the light of Gods word, which ſhines amongſt you now, or in the light of the Goſpel, which ſhall hereafter break forth from you, and ſhine amongſt all Nations. So that this may be taken as ſpoken both to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were then living in the days of the Prophet, and to their poſterity in the days of the Goſpel; and it is all one in effect as if he ſhould have ſaid, Let us believe in Chriſt, and love him and all Chriſtians for his ſake.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Therefore thou haſt forſaken thy people the houſe of Jacob, becauſe they be repleniſhed from the Eaſt, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, they are full of the rites and cuſtoms, and vices of the people inhabiting the Eaſtern Countries; amongſt which though the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> may be numbered, becauſe they lay Eaſtward of <hi>Judea,</hi> yet I conceive the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are here chiefly intended, becauſe they were amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> moſt uſually termed the Children of the Eaſt, or the people of the Eaſt, (See the Notes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.30. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.17.) and becauſe though it might not be unfitly ſaid, that it was from theſe Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that they had learnt their Idolatry, and other groſs ſins; yet the corrupt cuſtoms and rites here meant, wherewith they had been <hi>repleniſhed from the Eaſt,</hi> ſeem to be their Magick Arts, Sorceries, Divinations, and ſuch like ſuperſtitious practices, for which the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> were famous in thoſe times; as we ſee amongſt others, in <hi>Balaam,</hi> that egregious Sorcerer, who was of <hi>Pethor</hi> of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> Deut. 23.4. and brought by <hi>Balak out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Eaſt,</hi> Numb. 23. and herewith that ſuits well which followeth, <hi>and are ſoothſayers like the Philiſtines,</hi> (only withal obſervable it is, that becauſe the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> who were alſo much addicted to theſe Superſtitions, ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.2. bordered on the weſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did on the Eaſt, this is all one in effect, as if the Prophet had complained, that they had filled their land with theſe Heatheniſh practiſes from all the Nations that were round about them), <hi>and they pleaſe themſelves in the children of ſtrangers,</hi> that is, they follow the rites and cuſtoms of outlandiſh people with much delight, and are pleaſed to be like to them; for though ſome Expoſitors underſtand this of their abuſing themſelves with the children of ſtrangers in the horrid ſin of Sodomy, (a vice too common even amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.7.) and others of their priding themſelves in having many ſervants to attend them that were of foreign Nations; yet it is far more probable that the Prophet intended hereby, that they were much affected with conforming themſelves to thoſe their wicked rites and cuſtoms, or perhaps that they were pleaſed with having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and joining themſelves to them by Covenants and Marriages. But now for the dependance of theſe words upon that which went before. Some conceive that this ſad complaint which the Prophet here enters into of the woful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereinto the <hi>Jews</hi> had brought themſelves by their great ſins, tends to ſhew the reaſon, why in the foregoing verſe he had invited them to turn unto the Lord by unfeigned repentance, namely, becauſe God had in a manner forſaken them for their horrid wickedneſs, and expoſed them to the fury of their cruel enemies, and ſo they were in danger to be utterly caſt off and deſtroyed, if
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42788:20"/>
they did not prevent it, by a ſerious and timely returning to their God. And ſome add too, that herein a reaſon is hinted why he had inſerted the foregoing Prophecy of the Calling of the Gentiles. But I rather conceive that this is added as by way of correcting what he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>O houſe of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord;</hi> as if he had ſaid, But alas! to what end do I invite this people to repentance, ſeeing for their manifold horrid ſins God hath rejected them, and ſo they are in a hopeleſs condition. <hi>Therefore thou haſt forſaken thy people, the houſe of Jacob, becauſe, &amp;c.</hi> He the rather directs his ſpeech to God, to imply the ſtupidity of the people, and what little likelihood there was of prevailing with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Their land alſo is full of ſilver and gold, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, In this alſo they carry themſelves more like the Heathens that are round about them, than as becomes the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Inſtead of ſeeking Gods favour, they are all for heaping up riches, and filling their houſes and land with ſilver and gold; this they ſet their hearts upon, as putting all their confidence for their ſafety herein, and in this they pride themſelves, laviſhing it out upon themſelves, and upon all that belongs to them, yea even upon their Idols, ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. It is not therefore their having ſuch abundance of ſilver and gold, but their inſatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſs, and priding themſelves, and truſting in their riches, that is here taxed. And accordingly the following Clauſe may alſo imply this, <hi>Neither is there any end of their treaſures;</hi> that is, their covetous deſire after theſe things is inſatiable, they never think they have enough of them; though I think that is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet forth the uncountable abundance of their wealth. And the like we muſt conceive of that which is added concerning their horſes, <hi>Their land is alſo full of horſes, neither is their any end of their chariots;</hi> to wit, that they gloried and truſted in theſe, and minded not Gods favour. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Their land alſo is full of Idols, &amp;c.]</hi> This expreſſion is uſed to imply, both how openly this ſin was practiſed amongſt them, and likewiſe how violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were addicted to it; every corner of their land was full of theſe vanities; <hi>They worſhip the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made;</hi> an high degree of blindneſs and madneſs, that they that were the workmanſhip of God, ſhould adore an Image, which their own hands had made, inſtead of God their Creator.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himſelf, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, all ſorts of men, high and low do baſely proſtrate themſelves to theſe Idol-gods; <hi>therefore forgive them not;</hi> that is, let that vengeance which thou haſt threatned fall upon the body of this people, that thoſe that are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable may be reclaimed. But for ſuch imprecations, ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.4. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the duſt, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty.]</hi> Hereby the Prophet foreſhews that a day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was nigh at hand, wherein though their land were full of Horſes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, as he had ſaid before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. neither that, nor any thing elſe ſhould do them any good; all the poor refuge that ſhould be left them would be, that as deſperate men, that had no hope in God, nor no outward power, whereby to reſiſt their enemies; they ſhould endeavour to hide themſelves in rocks and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42788:20"/>
caves in the earth (a poor refuge) by reaſon of the dread that ſhould fall upon them, when the Lord ſhould appear in ſuch dreadful Majeſty to puniſh them by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> for all their wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be bowed down, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, he ſhall pull down the pride of thoſe that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted themſelves againſt God. The chief thing intended is, that they that baſely bowed down before their Idols, ſhould now be juſtly humbled and laid low by the juſt judgments of God. <hi>And the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day;</hi> that is, the Lord before whom ſuch baſe Idols are now preferred, ſhall then be alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, becauſe he ſhall then be known to be the only true God, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and pride of man ſhall be found to be nothing before him; they all confeſſing that it is he that hath brought theſe judgments upon them, and admiring his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite juſtice and power therein.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>For the day of the Lord of haſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, upon all the proud and great ones amongſt them. See the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the oaks of Baſhan.] Lebanon</hi> was famous for goodly tall Cedars. See the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.4. and ſo was <hi>Baſhan</hi> for mighty ſtrong oaks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Of the oaks of Baſhan have they made thine Oars.</hi> Now though the moſt of Expoſitors do here by theſe <hi>cedars and oaks,</hi> underſtand figuratively the great and weighty and lofty ones that were amongſt them, their Princes and Nobles, their rich and potent men that exalted themſelves againſt God (as indeed the Scripture doth elſewhere frequently ſpeak thus of ſuch men, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Behold the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a ſhadowing ſhroud, &amp;c.</hi> See alſo the Note, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15.) and others do underſtand hereby their ſtately build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made of the timber of theſe trees, (as indeed the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks after this manner of the deſtruction of the gallant houſes in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Zach. 11.1, 2. <hi>Open thy doers, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. Howl firr-tree, for the cedar is fallen; becauſe the mighty are ſpoiled; Howl, O ye oakes of Baſhan.]</hi> Yet becauſe it ſeems apparent that the Prophets deſign in this part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, firſt to foreſhew the deſtruction of the Inhabitants, even the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, (which he hath already done in the three foregoing verſes), and then afterwards the ruin of all things that were of greateſt note and excellency in their land, whereof they did moſt glory, and wherein they put the greateſt confidence, therefore I do not ſee why this ſhould not be underſtood literally of the havock the enemy ſhould make in burning up and hewing down the Cedars and Oaks, and other ſtately Trees that grew there in abundance; and that the rather with reſpect to the Idolatry that was daily committed in their Groves, where theſe Trees grew, wherewith God was highly offended; for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.29, 30.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up.]</hi> Hereby alſo ſome underſtand great and rich men, ſuch as were of great eminency, and did over-look and over-top the meaner fort, as mountains do the plains. And indeed the Scripture doth often ſpeak thus of the great ones of the world figuratively, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who art thou, O great mountain? before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42788:21"/>
Zerubbabel thou ſhalt become a plain.</hi> And, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt threſh the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and beat them ſmall, and make the hills as chaff.</hi> But here I rather conceive it is meant of the hilly and mountainous parts of the land, upon which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet threatens that vengeance ſhould come, the rather becauſe their high places were uſually there, and to let them know that theſe places which they deemed of impregnable ſtrength, and wherein they did ſo exceedingly glory and truſt, as places of ſure retreat in times of danger, ſhould be no refuge to them at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall.]</hi> Even this alſo ſome underſtand figuratively of men of great ſtrength and power, alledging for the proof hereof another place in our Prophet, where the ſame figurative expreſſion is uſed, to wit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.25. <hi>And there ſhall be upon every high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and upon every high hill, rivers and ſtreams of waters, in the day of the great ſlaughter, when the towers fall.</hi> But I conceive the meaning of theſe words is only this, that no fortifications or place of ſtrength ſhould be any defence to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And upon all the ſhips of Tarſhiſh, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.22. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.7. Becauſe they prided themſelves much in theſe their ſhips of great bulk and burden, the defence they were to the Kingdom, and the exceeding wealth they brought into them by way of merchandizing, the Prophet foretels, that theſe ſhould be alſo taken or deſtroyed by the enemy. <hi>And upon all pleaſant Pictures;</hi> that is, all the curious Pictures, wherein they ſo much delighted; under which may alſo be comprehended their Tapiſtry and Arras Hangings of Image-work, their curious wrought Plate, and all other the bravery of their houſes. Some indeed, becauſe this is joined here with <hi>the ſhips of Tarſhiſh,</hi> do particularly reſtrain this to the goodly Pictures and carved Images wherewith they adorned their ſhips, (and that this cuſtom of beautifying their ſhips was very ancient, we may ſee by that of the Poet,—<hi>Pictaſ<expan>

But I think it may better be underſtood of all their pleaſant houſhold-ornament; or that if any particular be intended, it may be their Idolatrous Pictures.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, And by this univerſal deſtruction which God ſhall bring upon theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, wherein ye have gloried ſo much, and put ſo much confidence, that ſhall be accompliſhed, which was before foretold, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>The lofty locks of man ſhall be humbled, &amp;c.</hi> of which ſee the Note there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And the Idols he ſhall utterly aboliſh.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, Both you and your Idols, before which you have humbled your ſelves, ſhall be deſtroyed together; ſo far they ſhall be from helping you, that they ſhall not be able to ſecure themſelves; yet it may be meant of their being deſtroyed, not only by the enemies, but alſo by thoſe that made and worſhipped their Idols, where they ſhould ſee with ſhame how little good they had done them. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.31.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And they ſhall go into the holes of the rocks, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And from thence that expreſſion ſeems to have been taken, which our Saviour uſeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.30. <hi>Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the mountains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us.</hi> The meaning is, that being affrighted with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42788:21"/>
of Gods Judgments, they ſhould be glad to creep into any hole to hide themſelves in. <hi>When he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth;</hi> that is, to break in upon them with ſuch fury that their State ſhall be in a manner ſhattered to pieces, and the hearts of the people ſhall tremble and ſhake as it were with an Earthquake. Yea becauſe we read of a dreadful Earthquake that was in the days of <hi>Uzziah, Amos</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp; Zach.</hi> 14.5. we may well think that hereby God did foreſhew that terrible concuſſion of the land, whereof the Prophet here ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>In that day a man ſhall caſt his Idols of ſilver, and his Idols of gold, which they made, each man for himſelf to worſhip, to the moles, and to the bats.]</hi> To wit, as being gods blinder than moles, and fitter to lye in darkneſs, and not to come abroad into the light, than bats are. The meaning is, that they ſhould of their own accord caſt away their moſt precious Idols which they had before moſt highly eſteemed, into any ſordid ſecret hole or corner as into ſome hole of the earth, where moles uſe to be, or into ſome dark and duſty corners of their houſes, where bats are wont to rooſt. And the reaſon intended why they ſhould do this, may be either firſt their aſtoniſhment and fear in that day of trouble and terrour; though haply at firſt they might deſire to keep them for the worth of the materials whereof they were made, yet afterwards that they might not be encumbred with them in their flight, they ſhould caſt them aſide into any ſecret obſcure place. Or, 2ly, rather, their diſregard and contempt of them; finding how unprofitable and vain they were, and being aſhamed of their former confidence in them, they ſhould throw them away with indignation and diſdain, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any vile neglected place good enough for ſuch gods to lye in.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>They go into the clefts of the rocks, &amp;c.]</hi> This is repeated to ſhew why they ſhould caſt away their Idols, as he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, to wit, either that being rid of them, they might flee the more freely, or becauſe they hoped for that ſhelter from the rocks which they could not afford them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Ceaſe from man, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, give over your confidence in man, <hi>whoſe breath is in his noſtrils,</hi> and ſo he may be taken away in a moment; though he may puff and ſeem to breathe forth wrath, yet alas his breath may be ſoon gone; <hi>for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> to wit, in and of himſelf, when God is not with him, and eſpecially when God is againſt him. The Prophet having threatned them with the ruin that was coming upon them, doth hereupon infer this warning, not to ſlight the foregoing threatnings out of a vain confidence in the ſtrength of their preſent eſtate. And withal, this makes way to that which follows in the next Chapter, where God threatens to deſtroy all in whom they might think they had moſt cauſe to truſt.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>FOr behold, &amp;c.]</hi> The Prophet having cloſed the foregoing Chapter with an exhortation not to truſt on man, <hi>Ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, &amp;c.</hi> here he adds this as a reaſon of that exhortation, to wit, that God would deſtroy all the power of man, and of all humane helps and ſupports, whereon they did with ſo much confidence rely. And obſervable it is, that he ſpeaks of this deſtruction, as of a thing which they might ſee immediately and ſuddenly coming upon them: <hi>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hoſts doth take away from Jeruſalem, and from Judah;</hi> that is, it ſhall be as certainly done, yea, and that ſuddenly too, as if it were doing already: <hi>the ſtay and ſtaff;</hi> that is, all things wherewith your ſtate is ſupported, and whereon you do for your preſervation and ſafety reſt and rely (and ſo under this general expreſſion may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all thoſe ſtays of their ſtate, which in this and the two following Verſes are particularly mentioned), or all things requiſite for the ſupport of mans life; and if we underſtand the words ſo, then the following words are added to ſhew what he meant here by <hi>the ſtay and the ſtaff,</hi> to wit, <hi>the whole ſtay of bread, and the whole ſtay of water,</hi> that is, all meat and drink neceſſary for the preſervation of mans life; for the phraſe here uſed, <hi>the ſtay of bread and water,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.26. And how this was accompliſhed, we may ſee, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.3. where it is ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when it was beſieged, <hi>That the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</hi> See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.9. <hi>&amp; Lam.</hi> 5.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>The mighty man, and the man of war, the Judg and the Prophet, and the prudent and the ancient.]</hi> By <hi>the mighty man</hi> may be meant ſuch as were great men amongſt the people for power of command; ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8. or rather men of great ſtrength, valour and courage; as indeed we find it expreſly mentioned that at the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> carried away <hi>all the Princes, and all the mighty men of valour,</hi> 2 King. 24.14. Again by <hi>the Prophet</hi> may be meant all their Teachers, or more particularly thoſe that had the ſpirit of Prophecy to foretel future things; which how it was accompliſhed, you may ſee in the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.10. when the Eyes of a Nation, thoſe which are the Rulers and Teachers are put out, that Nation muſt needs be in a ſad condition. And then by <hi>the prudent</hi> is meant men of a piercing judgment, able to bolt out the truth of things in the moſt difficult caſes, and to give a ſhrewd gueſs at things that ſhould afterward come to paſs. But for this ſee the Notes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.32.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The captain of fifty, &amp;c.]</hi> By mentioning this, which was one of the moſt inferior places of command, the Prophet implies that there ſhould ſcarce be a man left, that was fit to undertake the meaneſt and the loweſt charge for the leading forth and governing of their armies. As for the following words, <hi>and the honourable man and the counſellor,</hi> that which is tranſlated in our Bibles, <hi>the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42788:22"/>
honourable man,</hi> is in the Hebrew, <hi>a man eminent in countenance,</hi> and thereby is meant men that for their birth and place, their gravity, parts and vertue, were ſo reverenced, and of ſo great eſteem amongſt the people, that the very ſight of them cauſed an awe in the hearts of thoſe that came before them; they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried authority with them in their very countenance. See the Note, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.1. And then <hi>the cunning artificer</hi> is mentioned amongſt others, becauſe thoſe that were more than ordinary skilful in ſuch arts, were of great uſe in a State, as for the fortifying of their Cities, and making engines of war, and many other things both in civil and warlike imployments, that did contribute much to the uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the State, yea, and to the preſervation of mens lives; and the cutting off ſuch therefore muſt needs be a great invenience and loſs to a people. And accordingly indeed we read that when the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had taken <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others they carried away <hi>all the Craftſmen and Smiths,</hi> 2 King. 24.14. As for the laſt here named, <hi>and the eloquent Orator,</hi> or, <hi>the man of ſpeech,</hi> as it is in the margent, (which is in the Original, <hi>skilled in charms</hi>), the taking of theſe is mentioned, becauſe ſuch are very able to diſſwade from evil, and to perſwade to good, to reſtrain, to ſtill and ſuppreſs, and (as I may ſay) to charm the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, (as <hi>Abigal</hi> by her good language charmed <hi>David,</hi> and as the woman of <hi>Abel</hi> charmed <hi>Joab</hi> firſt, and afterward the whole City) and to bow the minds of men to thoſe things that may be for publick good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And I will give children to be their Princes, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe men of worth that ſhall be taken away, ſilly and childiſh men ſhall be brought to rule over them. And this might be ſpoken with reſpect to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> or rather to the four laſt Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> that did indeed manage their affairs very weakly. But ſee the Note, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the people ſhall be oppreſſed every one by another, and every one by his neighbour, &amp;c.]</hi> This is added to ſet forth what tumults, diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there ſhould be in the land amongſt people of all ranks, without any reſpect of age or ſtate, of neighbourhood or friendſhip, when thoſe that were the ſtay of the State were taken away, and men ſo unfit to rule ſhould have the reins of Government put into their hands, when there ſhould be no Governour, or ſuch as ſhould be as bad as none.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>When a man ſhall take hold of his brother, &amp;c.]</hi> The drift of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is to ſhew, that in that confuſion deſcribed in the foregoing verſe, the ſtate of things ſhould be ſo miſerable, and in ſuch a deſperate condition, that no man ſhould be willing to undertake the Government, (a thing which at other times men are wont moſt ambitiouſly to affect), though he were never ſo earneſtly preſſed to do it. <hi>When a man ſhall take hold of his brother of the houſe of his father;</hi> as if he had ſaid, In that confuſion men ſhall be ready to tender the Government to ſome one of their fathers family and kindred. And ſo too it may imply, that this ſhould be done factiouſly in ſeveral places, to the diſturbance of the common peace, ſome chuſing one, and ſome another, every one ſeeking to advance one of his own family, without any reſpect to the publick good. However this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of taking hold, <hi>a man ſhall take hold of his brother,</hi> doth clearly imply, how earneſtly they ſhould urge and preſs, and importune him, as thoſe that would have no denial, but would in a manner force him to undertake that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42788:23"/>
                  <hi>ſaying, Thou haſt clothing,</hi> that is, thou haſt better apparel than any of us have; an expreſſion which may imply, that they ſhould be brought to ſuch a low and poor condition, that if any man was but a little better clothed than the common ſort were, they ſhould proffer to make him their ruler: Or <hi>clothing</hi> may be mentioned figuratively, to imply an eſtate fit for a chief Magiſtrate, <hi>Thou haſt clothing,</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, Thou art well bred, and haſt been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly brought up, thou haſt an eſtate convenient for a Governour; at leaſt thou art not ſo low brought as we are, but haſt ſomewhat left to maintain thy ſtate. <hi>Be thou our ruler,</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, We chuſe thee to be our ruler, and therefore without any delay undertake this charge, <hi>and let this ruin be under thy hand,</hi> that is, undertake thou the charge and ſupport of this ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and declining ſtate. The meaning is, that they ſhould endeavour to affect him, to compaſſionate them in their miſery, ſaying, Thou ſeeſt we are like to be utterly ruined, put to thy helping hand to prevent it; by thy power do what thou canſt to bear us up and to uphold us from that ruin that is apparently coming upon us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>In that day, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, in that day of Gods vengeance before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; or in that very day, when the ſupreme Government ſhall be tendered to men, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, the man to whom it is tendered ſhall preſently, ſo ſoon as the motion is made to him, without taking any time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate or conſult about the buſineſs, refuſe the tender that is made to him, <hi>he ſhall ſwear, ſaying, I will not be an healer;</hi> that is, he ſhall not only refuſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but to ſhew how reſolved he was herein, he ſhall refuſe it with an Oath. It is in the Original, <hi>In that day ſhall he lift up,</hi> to wit, his hand; but thereby is meant, <hi>In that day ſhall he ſwear,</hi> for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 32.40, <hi>ſaying, I will not be a healer,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>a binder up,</hi> but for that ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. the meaning is, that to make them know, that he would never be drawn to take the Government upon him, he ſhould tell them plainly, that he was no way able to heal the breaches that were in their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined State; <hi>I will not be a healer;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Theſe wounds and breaches in your State exceed my skill, and are too hard for me to cure, I am no way fit to undertake ſuch a dangerous and difficult charge. <hi>For in my houſe is neither bread nor clothing; make me not a ruler of the people;</hi> that is, Whatſoever you may think, I have not an eſtate fit for ſuch a charge; which tends much to ſet forth the low and deſperate condition of the State at that time, whether it were a falſe oath, meerly out of fear, that he might decline the danger of accepting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment tendered, or whether he ſpake truly, and ſo thoſe ſhould be found to want neceſſaries for the ſupport of their own families, that were thought fit to be choſen to the higheſt places of Magiſtracy amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For Jeruſalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, &amp;c.]</hi> This may be taken as the continued ſpeech of the party ſpoken of in the foregoing verſe, that ſhould refuſe the ſupreme Government tendered to him: wherein he gives this as the reaſon of his refuſal, that the ſtate of the land was ſo far ruined, that it was not in his power to uphold it. Or rather as the words of the Prophet, foretelling the certainty of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r ruin by ſpeaking of it, as if it were done already; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al giving reaſon why it muſt need be ſo, <hi>Becauſe their tongue and their doings are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42788:23"/>
againſt the Lord to provoke the eyes of his glory;</hi> that is, his glorious eyes, the eyes of his glorious Majeſty, and who hath manifeſted himſelf amongſt them to be a God of infinite glory. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witneſs againſt them, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, Not only their words and deeds, but even their very countenance, their <hi>Whores forehead,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.3. the open profeſſion which they made of their impiety, did ſufficiently diſcover what impudent and vile wretches they were; there needs no other witneſſes to convince them. <hi>And they declare their ſin as Sodom, they hide it not;</hi> that is, they are no way aſhamed of it, but openly avow it, boaſting of it, and glorying in it, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did. <hi>Wo unto their ſoul;</hi> that is, wo to them. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>For they have rewarded evil to themſelves.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Say ye to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with him, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, let this be ſaid to thoſe that are righteous, and therefore live righteouſly; or let them aſſure themſelves of this. The drift of inſerting this may be to comfort thoſe few that were righteous amongſt them, by aſſuring them that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe ſad calamities which he had threatned ſhould come upon the land, it ſhould certainly go well with them; it ſhould fare well with them, however things went; or, by way of reproving the falſe Prophets, that ſadded the hearts of the righteous, and flattered the wicked; affirming, that it was not the wicked but the righteous only, with whom it ſhould go well, which is therefore more expreſly added in the following verſe, <hi>Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>As for my people, children are their oppreſſors, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16. <hi>And women rule over them;</hi> and according to the former branch, I conceive that hereby is meant effeminate and womaniſh men, fooliſh, vain, light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though I know ſome think it is ſpoken of the wives and mothers of their Princes, women of a proud imperious ſpirit, ſuch as <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and <hi>Athaliah</hi> were, and that their intermedling in, and over-ruling of State-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſhould be the cauſe of much miſchief in the land. But withal obſervable is the expreſs mention that is made, that all this ſhould be amongſt thoſe that were Gods peculiar people, <hi>As for my people, children are their oppreſſors, &amp;c.</hi> there being much in this, that there ſhould be ſuch diſorder amongſt thoſe that had enjoyed ſuch ſpecial means to teach them better, and that ſuch worthleſs men, boys and women, ſhould rule and domineer over a people that God had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to himſelf in ſo ſpecial a manner. And the rather is this to be obſerved, becauſe it is again expreſſed in the next clauſe, <hi>O my people, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to err;</hi> that is, thy Rulers and Princes miſlead thee; for of theſe he ſeems to be principally here ſpeaking, though indeed their Prieſts and Prophets may well be included too. This laſt clauſe may be read from the Original, as it is in the Margent, <hi>They which call thee bleſſed, cauſe thee to err;</hi> which alſo may be meant, both of their flattering Teachers and Magiſtrates, who though they ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the people by their evil Government, yet were wont to applaud their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs herein, and to aſſure them that all things did and ſhould go on happily with them. <hi>And deſtroy the way of thy paths;</hi> that is, they undo thee in regard of thy converſation and courſe of life; or they corrupt and mar thy ways, to wit,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42788:24"/>
by ſeducing and miſleading them into evil ways, through their ill Government, corrupt teaching and bad example, and by confirming and encouraging them in their wickedneſs, and making them incorrigible and incurable through their baſe flatteries, and groundleſs promiſes. In this phraſe of <hi>deſtroying the way of their paths,</hi> there ſeems to be an alluſion to thoſe that ſo mar the paths wherein men have been wont to go, that they that would go in them, cannot diſcern them. However clear it is, that all this is added as a dreadful effect of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in bringing ſuch to rule over them, and as an apparent diſcovery of the wickedneſs of the people in being ſo ready to obey their commands, and follow their examples, though never ſo bad.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Lord ſtandeth up to plead, and ſtandeth to judg the people.]</hi> That is, he is prepared, and juſt in a readineſs to do it, namely, to plead his own cauſe againſt a rebellious Nation, and the cauſe of his people againſt their cruel oppreſſors, and to puniſh them, and to deliver thoſe that are oppreſſed by them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, with the Judges and Magiſtrates, who were commonly choſen of thoſe that were old men, and therefore called, ſome of them at leaſt, Elders. See the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16. and it is again expreſſed, that they were the rulers of Gods peculiar people, <hi>the ancients of his people,</hi> purpoſely to hint unto them that they ſhould eſcape never a whit the more for that. <hi>For ye have eaten up</hi> (or <hi>burnt) the Vineyard,</hi> that is, ſay the moſt of Interpreters, Gods darling people, according to that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> and ſo taking it, the word <hi>ye</hi> is very Emphatical; as if he had ſaid, <hi>ye</hi> that I appointed to be keepers of my Vineyard, that ſhould have ſecured it from the ſpoil of beaſts and thieves, ye have been the thieves and the beaſts that have eaten it up, that have devoured it, and laid it waſte; but yet by <hi>the Vineyard</hi> may be meant the lands and inheritances of Gods poor people, which theſe great ones by their extortions and oppreſſions had eaten up and deſtroyed. And this indeed ſuits beſt with that which follows, <hi>The ſpoil of the poor is in your houſes,</hi> which is an evidence of your oppreſſions, that cannot be denied; and that of thoſe who ſo oppreſs, muſt needs be deemed the greateſt cruelty; your houſes that ſhould have been as Sanctuaries to the poor, are the very dens where you ſtore up all your ſpoil.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, that ye utterly undo and deſtroy them, and exerciſe all manner of cruelty upon them. <hi>And grind the faces of the poor:</hi> that is, cauſe them by your cruſhing and hard uſing of them, to pine away. So that in their poor lean faces it may be ſeen how cruelly ye have dealt with them. Or elſe by grinding their faces, may be meant their battering and beating their faces with their hands and fiſts, as we ſee it was uſual with that people to do, by what they did to <hi>Micajah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.24. to our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.22. and to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 23.3. As for the form of Expoſtulation here uſed, <hi>What mean ye that ye beat my people, &amp;c.</hi> that is all one as if he had ſaid, Why do ye uſe them ſo? what cauſe or reaſon can you give for it? who gave you any authority to do thus? what a boldneſs and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous fury is it in you to uſe my people thus? But ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42788:24"/>Ver. 16. <hi>Becauſe the Daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes, &amp;c.]</hi> It is not improbable, which ſome Expoſitors have obſerved, that having in the foregoing verſes condemned mens oppreſſing and ſpoiling of the poor, here he adds this againſt the pride of women, and the vanity of their attire, becauſe it was very much for the maintaining of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and gallantry of their wives and daughters, that the men did ſo oppreſs the poor. That which is render'd in our Tranſlation, <hi>wanton eyes,</hi> is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>deceiving with their eyes,</hi> becauſe by their leud and wanton, enticing looks, they did deceive and inſnare men, and draw them to luſt after them. As for that which follows, <hi>Walking and mincing,</hi> (or, <hi>tripping nicely) as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</hi> the meaning is, that out of pride and wantonneſs they went with an affected kind of pace, taking little ſteps, and ſeeming rather to ſwim than to go; and that they made a tinkling noiſe as they went, and that either by reaſon of ſome <hi>tinkling ornaments</hi> which they wore about their legs or feet, of which there is mention made, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. as namely garters or ſtrings and roſes on their ſhoos, with ſpangled lace, or chains, or rings, or bells faſtned to their ſhoos or buskins; or becauſe they ſhuffled or ſtamped with their feet, as if they had danced as they went, or becauſe they had Pantofles, that at every ſtep they took, made a noiſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Therefore the Lord will ſmite with a ſcab the crown of the head of the Daughters of Zion, &amp;c.]</hi> And ſo thoſe heads of theirs which they ſo proudly lifted up, ſhould not only be made bald, ſtripped of their hair, which women eſteem their chiefeſt ornament, and do moſt pride themſelves in, and are therefore moſt careful to cheriſh it, and to keep it fair and clear, but ſhould alſo become ſo lothſome, as being overſpread with this ſcab or ſcall, that they ſhould now be aſhamed to have it ſeen, and others ſhould turn away their eyes from ſeeing it. <hi>And the Lord will diſcover their ſecret parts,</hi> which might be done by the rage of the Soldiers that ſhould take them captives, and out of greedineſs to get ſpoil, ſhould ſtrip them to their very skin; whereto agreeth that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.26. <hi>They ſhall alſo ſtrip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels;</hi> or elſe by bringing them to ſuch a poor and low condition, that they who did formerly exceed in variety and change of raiment, and in the bravery of many fooliſh ſuperfluities, ſhould then ſcarce have clothes or rags enough to cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. But yet ſome underſtand the meaning of this to be, that the Lord ſhould ſuffer the women to be deflowred or raviſhed by their enemies; or at leaſt that in a way of ſcorn and luſt they ſhould be thus baſely and immodeſtly abuſed by the ruder ſort of people, into whoſe hands they ſhould fall.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments about their feet, &amp;c.]</hi> Which was done when they were carried away captives into <hi>Babylon</hi> bare-footed, and bare-leg'd. See the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>And their cauls,</hi> (or, <hi>net-works</hi>), whereby may be meant any attire, made ſo that their skin might be ſeen through it; though ſome underſtand it particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch kind of ſtockins, becauſe the Prophet is here ſpeaking of the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their feet. <hi>And their round tires like the Moon;</hi> that is, ſhaped like a Criſſent, a half or full Moon; of which all that can be ſaid is, that <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid that the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Princes had ſuch Jewels on their Camels necks
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42788:25"/>
And obſervable it is, what a multitude of the toys and vanities the Prophet here mentions, wherewith the women in thoſe days did trick out themſelves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely the better thereby to ſet forth their pride and folly, and exceſſive luxury.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And the Bonnets, &amp;c.]</hi> Hereby is meant ſome kind of Hoods, or other Head-tires. And therefore the ſame word is tranſlated, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.17. <hi>The tire of thine head.</hi> And 44.18. <hi>Linnen Bonnets.</hi> And ſo likewiſe by the next words, <hi>and the ornaments of the legs,</hi> may be meant their brave ſtockins or garters, or ſome other ſuch like ornament; for the ſame word is render'd, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. <hi>The bracelet that was on his arm.</hi> And by <hi>their head-bands,</hi> ſome curious fillets or ribbons wherewith they tyed their hair, or faſtned their head-tires to their heads. The greateſt difficulty is in the next words, <hi>and the Tablets,</hi> which being in the Original, <hi>houſes of the ſoul,</hi> I cannot conceive why their <hi>Tablets,</hi> which were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain flat Jewels were ſo called, unleſs it be becauſe they were the deſire of their ſouls, (in regard they were ſo exceeding curious and rich), or becauſe they wore them upon their breaſts, right over their hearts, which is eſteemed the chief ſeat of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>The Rings and Noſe-jewels.]</hi> Some think that in thoſe Eaſtern parts the women uſed to wear Jewels hanging down from their noſes, as well as from their ears; and that it was in alluſion to this cuſtom that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.22. <hi>That as a jewel of gold in a ſwines ſnout, ſo is a fair woman which is without diſcretion.</hi> But I rather think that theſe were Jewels which they uſed to wear hanging from their foreheads down to their noſes, and were therefore called <hi>Noſe-jewels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>The changeable ſuits of apparel.]</hi> That is, ſuits of apparel provided for change. But ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>The glaſſes and the fine linnen, &amp;c.]</hi> Hereby ſome underſtand their fine handkerchiefs; and others, their fine ſhifts. But it may be underſtood in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all the fine thin linnen which they uſed much to wear in thoſe hot Countrys, eſpecially in ſummer-time: And then by <hi>the Hoods</hi> next mentioned, is meant ſome attire which they wore on their heads, different from thoſe <hi>ver.</hi> 20. which are there called <hi>Bonnets.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Inſtead of ſweet ſmell, &amp;c.]</hi> This is added to ſet forth how ſad the change ſhould be, when their delicate women that flaunted it now with ſo much bravery, ſhould be carried away captives into <hi>Babylon. Inſtead of ſweet ſmell;</hi> to wit, by reaſon of the odoriferous ointment wherewith they uſed to anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the ſweet ſpices and powders, and perfumes they were wont to wear about them, <hi>there ſhall be a ſtink,</hi> which ſhould be cauſed by the ſores and ulcers that in their hard uſage ſhould grow upon them by the putrifying of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies after they had been beaten and ſcourged by their enemies, by their lying in priſons and dungeons, by their naſty attire in their extream poverty, and thoſe baſe ſervices wherein they ſhould be imployed. <hi>And inſtead of a girdle, a rent;</hi> that is, inſtead of thoſe brave girdles which uſed to be adorned with gold and precious gems, wherewith they were wont to girt their garments about them, there ſhall be nothing but tattered rags, hanging looſe about them in a ſlattern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, ſo that their nakedneſs ſhall not be covered thereby. <hi>And inſtead of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42788:25"/>
well-ſet hair;</hi> that is, hair curiouſly curled, ſmooth combed, and layed neatly; <hi>Baldneſs,</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>And inſtead of a ſtomacher, a girding of ſack-cloth,</hi> the uſual attire of people in great miſery and mourning. <hi>And burning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of beauty;</hi> that is, they that were formerly ſo proud of their beauty, and ſo chary to preſerve it, ſhall be then tanned and Sun-burnt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Thy men ſhall fall by the ſword, &amp;c.]</hi> This is ſpoken to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the whole Kingdom or Nation of <hi>Judah,</hi> being collectively conſidered as one body. Having ſhewn how God would avenge himſelf on their proud women, here he adds likewiſe how he would deal with the men; and that too doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imply the miſery of the women, who having loſt their husbands and friends, ſhould be ſtripped of all their bravery, and be brought into a mourning condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Thy men ſhall fall by the ſword, and thy mighty in the war;</hi> which is in the Original, <hi>and thy might in the war,</hi> where <hi>thy might</hi> is put for thy mighty ones, as it is uſual with us, when we ſpeak of the Nobles and Gentlemen of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to call them <hi>the Nobility and the Gentry.</hi> However the meaning is, that God would cut off thoſe in whoſe multitude and valour they had put ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And her gates ſhall lament and mourn,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the gates of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall ſeem to mourn, becauſe whilſt Jeruſalem was in a flouriſhing condition, the people uſed to paſs in and out through the gates continually; and becauſe the Magiſtrates uſed to fit in judgment (ſee the Notes <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.1, 2. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 127.5.) and ſo there the greateſt glory of their State was ſeen; and there was ſtill the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Aſſemblies, and greateſt concourſe of the people; whereas after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the gates were ruined, and lay unfrequented; therefore it is ſaid here, <hi>Her gates ſhall lament and mourn;</hi> and the meaning is, that they ſhould look ſadly, or that they ſhould be a very lamentable ſpectacle to all that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them. We have the like expreſſions Jer. 14.2. <hi>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languiſh; they are black unto the ground.</hi> And Lam. 1.4. <hi>The ways of Zion do mourn, becauſe none come to the ſolemn feaſt: all her gates are deſolate:</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows here alſo, <hi>and ſhe being deſolate</hi> (or <hi>emptied</hi>) that is cleared of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and riches, <hi>ſhall ſit upon the ground;</hi> to wit, as a ſad widow bereaved of her husband and children; for this ſitting on the ground was the uſual cuſtom of mourners, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.14. <hi>And behold there ſat women weeping for Tammuz.</hi> And <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Elders of the daughter of Zion ſit upon the ground and keep ſilence.</hi> See alſo <hi>Job</hi> 2, 10. yet it is likely there is an alluſion alſo in the words to the ruinous ſtate of a City, that being battered down and burnt with fire, may be well ſaid to lye in the duſt, according to that <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.12. <hi>The fortreſs of the high fort of thy walls ſhall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the duſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>ANd in that day, &amp;c.)</hi> That is, in the day when God ſhall have brought all the evil forementioned upon you, <hi>ſeven women,</hi> that is, many women (ſee the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>ſhall take hold of one man;</hi> that is, whereas it ſtands not with the modeſty uſually found in that ſex to woo thoſe whom they deſire to make their husbands, but rather they expect to be ſued to by them, and much leſs can they endure a husband that hath more wives than themſelves; yet ſuch ſhall be the extream ſcarcity of men in thoſe times by reaſon of the havock which the ſword of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhall have made amongſt them, that many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall of their own accord deſire this, and with ſo much importunity preſs their requeſt upon one man, as if they would extort a conſent from him, and would take no denial; for this is implied in that which is here ſaid, that they ſhould <hi>take hold</hi> of him, even that they ſhould proſecute their ſuit with ſo much vehemency, as if they would force themſelves upon him. I know the words may be underſtood of many women contending for one man, each one intending to have him to her ſelf alone. But becauſe Polygamy was uſual amongſt that people in thoſe times, and becauſe this doth beſt ſet forth what a ſcarcity there ſhould be then of men, I do rather underſtand it of many deſiring to be his wives jointly together. And leſt he ſhould deny them, as being loth to bring ſuch a charge of wives and children upon him, eſpecially in ſuch a time of penury and want, therefore they are ſaid to add that which follows, <hi>We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel;</hi> that is, we will no way be any charge to thee, but will our ſelves maintain both us and ours, <hi>only let us be called by thy name;</hi> that is, accept us to be thy wives, that it may be ſaid that thou art our husband, and we are thy wives, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 19.25. <hi>&amp; Jer.</hi> 14.9. There is in this expreſſion an alluſion to that ancient cuſtom of calling the wife by the name of her husband, <hi>to take away our reproach;</hi> to wit, the reproach of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving husbands, or not having children; for becauſe God had promiſed fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in child-bearing as a great bleſſing unto that people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.14. <hi>There ſhall not be male or female barren among you;</hi> therefore they looked upon barrenneſs as a great curſe and reproach to them; whence it was that <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid upon the birth of her ſon <hi>Joſeph, God hath taken away my reproach;</hi> ſee the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6. Yea, and the younger ſort living without husbands, as if no man regarded them, was counted a diſhonour; and therefore we find it mentioned as one of the ſad effects of Gods judgments upon his people, <hi>that their maidens were not given in marriage,</hi> Pſal. 78.63.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>In that day, &amp;c.]</hi> Leſt the foregoing threatnings concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation that was to come upon the people of God, ſhould quite diſcourage the faithful that were amongſt them, and cauſe them to queſtion, how then the Covenant which God had made with his Church ſhould be ratified, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42788:26"/>
how the Promiſes which he had made to them concerning the ſtability and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Church ſhould be accompliſhed; to chear them up is this promiſe here inſerted, as the like was before done, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.25, 26. concerning which ſee the Notes there. <hi>In that day,</hi> to wit, when God ſhall have brought all the forementioned judgments upon them, and thereby ſhall have ſwept away thoſe that were incorrigibly wicked, and ſhall have exceedingly purged thoſe that ſhall be left, though then the people ſhall be brought to ſo low a condition, that their eſtate ſhall ſeem to be hopeleſs, yet even then <hi>in that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious.</hi> And this is three ſeveral ways expounded by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, though indeed they are all much to one and the ſame effect. 1. The moſt of Expoſitors do by this <hi>Branch of the Lord</hi> underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſias, and that eſpecially becauſe the ſame, or the like Title, is ſo often given to him elſe-where in the Scripture, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>And there ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſs, and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. <hi>I will raiſe unto David a righteous Branch.</hi> And 33.15. <hi>At that time will I cauſe the Branch of Righteouſneſs to grow up unto David.</hi> And <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will bring forth my ſervant the BRANCH.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Behold the man whoſe name is the BRANCH.</hi> And accordingly they underſtand this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy thus, that after thoſe forementioned calamities, when the ſtock of <hi>Davids</hi> family ſeemed in a manner quite withered and dead, the Lord ſhould ſuddenly and unexpectedly cauſe a <hi>Branch</hi> to ſprout forth from that ſtem, that ſhould be <hi>beautiful and glorious;</hi> which is all one as if he had ſaid, that from that family thus decayed, and in a manner quite dead, God would raiſe up to his people a Captain and Commander that ſhould turn their ſorrow into joy, and bring them into a happy condition again; for by this Branches being <hi>beautiful and glorious</hi> to the remnant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may be meant, the amiableneſs, and the glory and majeſty of Chriſt, as well in regard of the tranſcendent dignity of his perſon, being the only begotten Son of God, that thought it not robbery to be equal with God, and every way repleniſhed abundantly for the diſcharge of his work; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in regard of the eminency of his office, and the wonderful bliſs which thereby redounded to his people, he being their head; and ſo the fountain from whence all grace, life and ſalvation was derived to them; and ſo the meaning in effect is this, that Chriſt ſhould reſtore the remainder of his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> to glory and honour by his ſalvation and grace.</p>
               <p>Again, 2ly. others underſtand this place thus, That the grace and favour of God, or the gifts and benefits, and graces which God ſhould beſtow upon his people, ſhould ſpring up and be viſible amongſt them, though before in ſuch a deſolate condition, as a <hi>branch beautiful and glorious.</hi> And indeed we find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion much to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.11. concerning which ſee the Note there.</p>
               <p>But, 3ly, very many of our beſt Expoſitors do by <hi>the branch of the Lord,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Church and people of God; which agreeth with that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant.</hi> And 44.3, 4. <hi>I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine off-ſpring, and they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as willows by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſes.</hi> And ſo they take the meaning of that which is here foretold to be this,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42788:27"/>
that whereas the people of God after the calamities before threatned, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, ſhould be as a piece of ground waſted and dried, and parched, never likely to become a people any more, much leſs to recover their ancient ſplendor and glory; yet after that, out of theſe poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>branch of the Lord</hi> ſhould ſpring forth <hi>beautiful and glorious;</hi> that is, this poor deſpiſed people ſhould as a new Church ſprout out afreſh, and be reſtored to as glorious a condition as ever. And however this was partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the rebuilding of the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and more eſpecially in their ſpiritual glory, becauſe they that ſhould be preſerved out of the prophane rabble that were deſtroyed, ſhould be purged from their Idolatry and other wickedneſs, and ſo ſhould become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Gods ſight; yet doubtleſs it was principally fulfilled in the glory they attained, when they became the people and Kingdom of Chriſt. So that (as is ſaid before) it is much at one, whether we underſtand this of Chriſt, who was the glory of his Church, or of the Church in whom Chriſt was glorified. And to be ſure very fit it was that Gods people ſhould for their comfort be put upon the expectation of thoſe glorious days of the Goſpel, becauſe even after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Babylon</hi> the ſtate of the Church ſhould be ſtill in many regards ſo mean and contemptible. As for the following clauſe, <hi>And the fruit of the earth ſhall be excellent and comely for them that are eſcaped of Iſrael;</hi> ſome underſtand this alſo of the excellency and lovelineſs of Chriſt, and that he is called <hi>the fruit of the earth</hi> with reſpect to his manhood. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.11. And others by <hi>the fruit of the earth,</hi> as before by <hi>the branch of the Lord,</hi> underſtand the Church and people of God, to wit, that thoſe poor remainders of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſhould be left in the land after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhould again grow up to an eſtate of great excellency and glory, like ſome fruit-bearing plant that ſhould ſuddenly ſpring out of a dry parched ground, and bring forth rich and goodly fruit, which they chiefly apply to that ſpiritual glory which they ſhould attain by Chriſt their promiſed Meſſias in the days of the Goſpel. But the moſt of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors do by <hi>the fruit of the earth</hi> here underſtand the rich and plenteous gifts of Gods bounty and grace, which after that time the people of God ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the land ſhould yield her fruit in wonderful plenty, excellent and goodly (under which all other things tending to their outward happineſs and glory may be comprehended), which whether it were occaſioned by the lands lying fallow in moſt places ſo many years together, during the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, or by the extraordinary bleſſing of God upon it, did tend much to their bliſs and glory in outward reſpects; whence is that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.35. <hi>And they ſhall ſay, This land that was deſolate is become like the garden of Eden, &amp;c.</hi> See the Note alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.16.</p>
               <p>And, 2ly, that they ſhould excel and become moſt amiable and lovely for the manifold graces of God in them, the fruits of the Spirit, wherewith they ſhould be moſt richly adorned; for thus the Scripture is wont to ſpeak of the holineſs and righteouſneſs of Gods people, as of a ſpiritual fruit, ſpringing from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of grace in the heart, and appearing gloriouſly in their lives and converſation; and thence is that <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.8. <hi>Drop down ye heavens from above,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42788:27"/>
and let the skies pour down righteouſneſs; let the earth open, and let them bring forth ſalvation, and let righteouſneſs ſpring up together.</hi> And that <hi>Chap.</hi> 61.3. where the people of God are called <hi>the trees of righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.</hi> See alſo again the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.11.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, &amp;c.]</hi> Here the Prophet ſets forth what that glory chiefly was, which God ſhould confer upon his Church, to wit, <hi>that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jeruſalem;</hi> that is, thoſe that were left alive, not in <hi>Babylon</hi> (for many of thoſe did chuſe to continue there, deſpiſing the liberty that was tendered then for their return into their own land) but <hi>in Zion and Jeruſalem,</hi> being returned thither from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which may be comprehended even thoſe that after their return dwelt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the land, becauſe they alſo went up yearly to <hi>Zion</hi> to worſhip there), <hi>ſhall be called holy,</hi> that is, ſhall be a holy people, ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.26. when God had deſtroyed the wicked that were amongſt them, and purified thoſe that were left, by his ſpirit, theſe ſhould now be a holy Nation, <hi>even every one that is written among the living in Jeruſalem;</hi> that is, every one whom God had fore-appointed to ſurvive the calamities of thoſe times, and to be found living amongſt thoſe that ſhould return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now if it be objected againſt this Expoſition, That it was not thus with the <hi>Jews</hi> when they returned out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is evident by the ſtory of thoſe times, that even amongſt the little remnant of Gods people, there were many wicked ones; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were far from being all holy. To this I anſwer, That there was a great Reformation then wrought in the whole body of the people, in that they were greatly purged from their Idolatry, and other groſs ſins, that were formerly rife amongſt them, which was a kind of ſhadow of that thorow Reformation which God intended to work in his Church. And 2. That ſo far as this Prophecy hath reſpect to that real work of Reformation and Sanctification, which is here alſo promiſed, it muſt be intended to the intire holy change that was to be wrought in the Church in all ſucceeding ages; which as it was began at that time of the purifying of the people of God, when they were delivered out of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, and brought home to their own Country; for it was to be further carried on in the days of the Goſpel, till at laſt it ſhould be perfected at Chriſts ſecond coming. And if thus we underſtand this Prophecy, then by that remnant <hi>in Zion and in Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>ſhall be called holy,</hi> we muſt underſtand all the members of the Myſtical Church, who are all truly ſanctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt; and accordingly then the following clauſe, <hi>even every one that is written among the living in Jeruſalem,</hi> may be meant of ſuch as God had decreed unto holineſs here, and ſo unto life eternal in Heaven; concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. and 87.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</hi> &amp;c.] That is of the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſpiritually, the viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. Yet it may well be, that the Prophet doth the rather uſe this expreſſion, with reſpect to that which he had ſaid, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.16. concerning the women daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> which had a great ſtroak in bringing thoſe ſad judgments upon <hi>Zion,</hi> whereof he had before ſpoken. And ſhould this be ſo, obſervable it were, that the bravery and vanity wherein they had ſo prided
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42788:28"/>
themſelves, is here turned into <hi>filth.</hi> Having before ſaid, that the remnant of Gods people ſhould be pure and holy, beautiful and glorious, excellent and comely; here the Prophet ſheweth when, and how this ſhould be done, <hi>when the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughters of Zion;</hi> that is, their manifold ſins and wickedneſs, <hi>and ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from the midſt thereof;</hi> where, by <hi>blood,</hi> may be meant, the ſame that was before called <hi>filth,</hi> namely their vile and loathſome ſins (for indeed we look upon nothing as a fouler defilement, than when a thing is beſmeared with blood, therefore the filthineſs of ſin is ſometimes termed <hi>blood,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood);</hi> or elſe rather, the blood of Gods Prophets, and other innocent men, which they had ſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> or more generally, their bloody oppreſſions and cruelties, which is the more probable, becauſe this ſeems to be ſpoken with relation to the Prophets foregoing complaints, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bloody ſins, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.15, 21. concerning which ſee the Notes there. As for the following words, thereby is ſhown, how their filth and blood ſhould be waſhed and purged away, namely, <hi>by the ſpirit of judgment, and by the ſpirit of burning;</hi> for the underſtanding whereof, we muſt know, that by this word, <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> where it is attributed to God, is frequently meant in the Scripture, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or the fervent and vehement efficacy of every operation of God, much the ſame that is called elſewhere the zeal of God, as <hi>chap.</hi> 9.7. <hi>the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this:</hi> So that in ſaying, that their filth and blood ſhould be waſhed and purged away <hi>by the ſpirit of judgment,</hi> the Prophet means, that it ſhould be done by Gods ſevere judgments, executed upon them, whereby Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and other wicked ones ſhould be cut off and deſtroyed from amongſt them. And 2. By Gods preſerving and reforming the better ſort, and bringing things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again into good order in the Church; and ſo likewiſe in ſaying, it ſhould be done <hi>by the ſpirit of burning,</hi> he means, that it ſhould be done by a vehement zeal, hot and burning like fire, both for the deſtroying of the wicked that were amongſt them, and burning them up like ſtubble (which ſome think alſo is ſpoken with relation to the burning of the Temple and City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the ſins of his choſen ones, even as the droſs is purged away by the Refiners fire. But ſee the Notes, chap. 1.25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount-Zion, and upon her aſſemblies, a cloud and ſmoak by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night,</hi> &amp;c.] As if the Prophet ſhould have ſaid, When the Lord ſhall have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Church and people, and ſhall have brought them into that glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here before promiſed, he will then as wonderfully and miraculouſly guide and protect them in <hi>every dwelling-place</hi> where any of them ſhall have their abode, and in their publick <hi>aſſemblies</hi> where they ſhall meet together for the worſhip and ſervice of God, as he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he led them through the wilderneſs by a <hi>cloud and ſmoak by day,</hi> that is, by a cloud black and thick like ſmoak, <hi>and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night;</hi> concerning which, ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. Even when there ſhould be no appearance of any means for their preſervation, yet that ſhould not hinder their protection, becauſe the Lord, as he did then for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> would create means for the ſheltring and ſecuring of them. And indeed becauſe God did diſcover ſuch riches of grace to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the many
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42788:28"/>
wonders that he wrought for them in delivering them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> therefore the Prophets do uſually ſet forth all the great things that God hath promiſed to do for his Church, by expreſſions that do allude to that great work. And to the ſame purpoſe is that following clauſe, <hi>for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence:</hi> that is, there ſhall be a ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence over that remnant of his people, of whom it was before ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. that they ſhould be brought into ſuch a glorious condition; or, that the glory, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition whereto God would advance his people, ſhould be ſecured and maintained by means of a divine protection overſhadowing every part of it: for herein alſo that Prophet ſeems to allude to that clouds covering the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which was in it ſelf a glorious repreſentation of the Church, as it was Gods dwelling-place, as uſually at all times where the people reſted, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.16. <hi>So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night:</hi> or elſe eſpecially at that time when the Tabernacle was firſt ſet up, when it was in a miraculous manner filled with the glory of God, Exod. 40.34. <hi>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And there ſhall be a tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be added with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to, and as an explication of that foregoing verſe, as if it had been ſaid, And that <hi>cloud</hi> which the Lord ſhall create, or that <hi>defence</hi> which ſhall be upon all the glory, <hi>ſhall be a tabernacle</hi> to ſhelter them from all danger. Or this may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figurative expreſſion to ſet forth how ſafely they ſhould be protected, <hi>And there ſhall be a tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a cover from ſtorm and from rain:</hi> wherein there ſeems to be an alluſion to the tents or tabernacles which ſhepherds were wont to provide to keep them and their flocks from the heat of the Sun by day, and to ſhelter them from ſtorms, and from rain both by day and by night: yet ſome conceive that there is an alluſion herein to God's Tabernacle; and that the drift hereof is to ſignifie, either that Gods people ſhould be under the defence before promiſed, as ſafe as they that fled for ſhelter to the ſanctuary; whereto agreeth that promiſe, Ezek. 11.16. <hi>I will be to them as a little ſanctuary:</hi> ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5. or elſe, that as the Tabernacle was, by the covering that was thereon, defended from all annoyances of wind and weather, both ſtorms and rain; ſo ſhould the Church be defended by the provident care of God over rhem, from all evils whatſoever, both greater and leſſer evils: for which ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.5, 6.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>NOw will I ſing,</hi> &amp;c.] This is another Prophecy, diſtinct from that which went before: and it is compoſed in the way of a mournful ditty, ſetting forth the great care and coſt that God had beſtowed upon his people, the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and how ill they had requited him for all that good that he had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42788:29"/>
done for them. And why God would have ſuch like paſſages as this, expreſſed in ſongs, may be ſeen in the Note upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Now will I ſing to my well-beloved,</hi> &amp;c. Some Expoſitors hold that this is ſpoken in the perſon of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lord of the Vineyard; and conſequently that it is Chriſt, his well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, <hi>his dear Son, the Son of his love,</hi> Col. 1.13. of whom he ſpeaks here, <hi>Now will I ſing to my well-beloved,</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. But I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all, why we ſhould not take theſe words as ſpoken by the Prophet in his own name. <hi>Now will I ſing,</hi> that is, I will compoſe, recite and publiſh in the way of a Song, <hi>to my well-beloved,</hi> that is, to the Lord Chriſt, whom with my ſoul I love. For the Prophets and Apoſtles are in a ſpecial manner, with reſpect to their office, termed the friends of the Bridegroom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.15. And in ſaying, <hi>Now will I ſing to my well-beloved,</hi> his purpoſe is to ſhew that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Song for his ſake, that it might be to his praiſe and glory, (according to that expreſſion of <hi>Davids,</hi> Pſal. 101.1. <hi>To thee, O Lord, will I ſing</hi>), that he had not done it out of a deſire to caſt any aſperſions thereby upon the Jews, but out of love to God in Chriſt, and zeal to his glory, as grieving to ſee him diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and deſpiſed by a people for whom he had done ſuch great things, and that he might bring them to repentance, or at leaſt leave them inexcuſable, and might however vindicate Gods juſtice in puniſhing ſuch an unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful people. And then for the words that follow, <hi>A Song of my beloved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Vineyard,</hi> they are added to ſet forth the ſubject-matter of the Song, to wit, that though it were written in the way of an elegant Parable, yet it was intended concerning his <hi>beloved,</hi> the Lord Chriſt, and <hi>touching his Vineyard,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was written in his name, and by the inſpiration of his Spirit, and that to ſhew what he had done for his people, and how ill they had requited the care that he had taken of them, and the abundant means that he had uſed to do them good. And indeed the Church of God is frequently in the Scripture compared to a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> (ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.11, 12.) 1. Becauſe the Church are in themſelves a weak and feeble people, as the Vine in compariſon of other Trees, is a poor weak plant, not able to bear up it ſelf. 2. Becauſe God doth ſo highly prize, and dearly love his Church above all people, even as men are wont to eſteem and delight in their Vineyards more than all their poſſeſſions beſides. 3. Becauſe no part of mens husbandry do ſtand in need of ſo much care and coſt, as the Vineyards do. And, 4. becauſe the fruit of the Vine is ſo precious, and the ſtem thereof ſo uſeleſs, if it bear no fruit; in regard whereof, as in ſundry other reſpects, the Church may well be compared to the Vine. And very probable it is, that hence Chriſt took thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables concerning Vineyards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.28, <hi>&amp;</hi> 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful hill.]</hi> Here the Song begins, where there is in the firſt place mention made of the Vineyards being planted <hi>in a very fruitful hill,</hi> becauſe indeed Vines thrive beſt in hills, if they be of a good ſoil, <hi>Bacchus amat colles,</hi> whence is that expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10. <hi>The hills were covered with the ſhadow of it;</hi> and herein it ſeems he alludes, either to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great fruitfulneſs of the land of <hi>Canaan, Pſal.</hi> 80.8, 9. or rather to that eminent and happy eſtate whereinto God had brought that people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And he fenced it, &amp;c.]</hi> To wit, both with a hedg, and with a wall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42788:29"/>
that, as is evident by that which is ſaid afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I will take away the hedg thereof, and break down the wall thereof;</hi> for which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.12. <hi>And gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt Vine, and built a tower in the midſt of it;</hi> to wit, as a watch-tower, from whence the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Vineyard might over-look the whole ground round about it, and watch that no thieves or beaſts did break into it; <hi>and alſo made a winepreſs therein,</hi> to wit, as making no queſtion but that he ſhould in time reap the fruit of his Vineyard, as a recompence of all his coſt and pains. Many ſeveral ways Expoſitors do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the myſtical ſenſe of the ſeveral branches of this Parable, as in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the watch-tower, that thereby <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is meant, wherein the Prieſts and Judges were to reſide, as keepers of Gods Vineyard. But it is too much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in expounding this Parable thus to determine of every particular. The drift of all in general is to ſet forth, that nothing was omitted that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the fruitfulneſs of the Vineyard; whereupon that complaint is inferred in the next words; <hi>and he looked,</hi> to wit, with a longing deſire and hope, <hi>that it ſhould bring forth grapes,</hi> that is, good grapes, namely, when the Vines were grown up, and the time of vintage came, <hi>and it brought forth wild grapes,</hi> that is, naughty unſavoury grapes, like thoſe that grow on wild vines, that are uſually found in hedges. The meaning is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not return to God that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience which might juſtly have been expected from them; but were moſt wicked in their lives, more like Heathens than like Gods peculiar people. See <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And now, O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and men of Judah, judg I pray you, between me and my Vineyard.]</hi> And thus the Lord doth unqueſtionably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence how unexcuſable the <hi>Jews</hi> were, and how juſt cauſe he had to deſtroy them, becauſe <hi>theſe inhabitants of Jeruſalem and men of Judah,</hi> were thoſe whom he had termed the Lords Vineyard; and therefore they being called to judg in his caſe of the Vineyard, yea any man amongſt them, this muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that if God ſhould appeal to their own conſciences, or to the deciſion of any reaſonable man amongſt them, they muſt needs acquit him, and condemn themſelves. And thus our Saviour dealt with thoſe whom he intended by the husbandmen to whom the Vineyard was let out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.40, 41.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? &amp;c.]</hi> To wit, In regard of outward means; for the Lord holds himſelf here to the former Allegory of the Lord of a Vineyard, who can only take care that no outward means be neglected, that are like to be helpful to make his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to bring forth good fruit, but cannot command a bleſſing from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to make it yield its increaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. In applying therefore this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, we muſt not ſay that God could do no more than he did to make the <hi>Jews</hi> a holy people. There is no queſtion but that God could by the mighty working of his Spirit have changed their hearts, and have made them brought forth fruit meet for repentance. But this God was not bound to do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the drift of this expreſſion is only to ſhew, that no outward means had been wanting to make them bring forth good fruit, and that therefore they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to plead for themſelves, they were altogether inexcuſable, he had done enough to bring them to live holily, as became Gods people, if they had not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42788:30"/>
been a perverſe ſtubborn people. And to this purpoſe alſo tends that following Expoſtulation, <hi>Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> as if he had ſaid, was there any reaſon it ſhould be thus? But ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, &amp;c.]</hi> Thus God is wont to forewarn men of the judgments that are coming upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he inflicts them: <hi>I will take away the hedg thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up: and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden down,</hi> ſee the Note above <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 80.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And I will lay it waſt, &amp;c.]</hi> The drift of this, and the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions is to ſhew that God would no longer ſhew ſo much care, nor be at ſuch coſt for the good of this people, as formerly; yet many Expoſitors do apply theſe expreſſions ſeverally in a myſtical ſenſe, <hi>I will lay it waſt;</hi> that is, I will deprive them of all thoſe priviledges which they enjoyed as my peculiar people, and they ſhall be left in the ſame condition with other Nations; or their land ſhall be left waſt and deſolate, which agreeth with that of our Saviour, <hi>Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate,</hi> Mat. 23.38. <hi>It ſhall not be pruned nor digged;</hi> that is, there ſhall not be that care taken of them by their teachers to reprove them, and reform them, and make them fruitful in good, as there hath been. (In the word <hi>(digged)</hi> there is an alluſion to the cuſtom of digging about their vines, to get out the weeds, and to looſen the earth, that the water wherewith they were watered, might the better come to the roots, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>but there ſhall come up briers and thorns,</hi> that is, Idolatry and all kind of wickedneſs ſhall abound amongſt them, and overſpread the land. <hi>I will alſo command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it;</hi> that is, they ſhall have no teachers to inſtruct them; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9. (for the inſtruction of Gods Prophets is often in the Scripture compared to the rain, ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. <hi>&amp; Job</hi> 29.23.) or if they have teachers, there ſhall be no bleſſing from Heaven to make their teaching effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for their good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For the Vineyard of the Lord of hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant, &amp;c.]</hi> Here the foregoing Parable is explained. And the men of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> are more particularly termed the Lords <hi>pleaſant plant</hi> (alluding therein to that which was uſual, that in Vineyards men had ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſome vines, which they eſteemed and delighted in above the reſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord had done more for them, than for all the other Tribes, ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.68, <hi>&amp;</hi> 87.2. and that eſpecially becauſe God had appointed that out of their Tribe the Meſſiah ſhould ſpring; and the more God had done for them, the more abominable was their ingratitude. And then in the next words is ſhewn what the wild grapes were, which this Vineyard brought forth inſtead of good grapes; <hi>and he looked for judgment, but behold oppreſſion; for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but behold a cry;</hi> to wit, ſins that cried to God for vengeance: ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10. or rather the cry of the oppreſſed, complaining both to God and man of the injuries done them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Wo unto them that join houſe to houſe, that lay field to field, &amp;c.]</hi> The Parable being ended and explained, here the Prophet proceeds to an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome principal heads of their grievous ſins, the <hi>wild grapes,</hi> which Gods
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42788:30"/>
Vineyard brought forth. And having in the foregoing verſe mentioned <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> as one of their great crying ſins, here in the firſt place he inveighs againſt their covetouſneſs, as that which was the root of all their oppreſſions. It is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unlawful for men to join one houſe to another, or to lay one field to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, to purchaſe ſeveral houſes, and ſeveral fields. That which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet condemns, is their inſatiable covetouſneſs, that they never had enough, but were ſtill ſeeking to enlarge their poſſeſſions, not caring how unjuſtly they did it, by fraud or violence wreſting other mens poſſeſſions from them. And becauſe by the Law of God it was unlawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> to alienate their lands from one Tribe to another, (ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.23. <hi>&amp; Numb.</hi> 36.7.) it may well be that this encroaching upon other mens poſſeſſions is here amongſt others intended, ſee the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Till there be no place;</hi> that is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, till there be no place left which they have not gotten into their poſſeſſion; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till there be no place left for their poor neighbours to dwell near them; as if the land had been given only for them to dwell in, which is implied in thoſe laſt words, <hi>That they may be placed alone in the midſt of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>In mine ears, ſaid the Lord of hoſts, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, the Lord ſpake this which I ſhall now tell you, in my hearing; which agreeth with that expreſſion of our Saviours, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.21. <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears;</hi> or, The Lord revealed it ſecretly to me by the inſpiration of his Spirit. Yet many tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it, as it is in the Margent of our Bibles, <hi>This is in mine ears, ſaith the Lord of hoſts;</hi> and then the meaning muſt needs be, that the cry of their oppreſſions in joining houſe to houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, or the cry of thoſe that were oppreſſed by them, was gone up into the ears of the Lord, though they thought he regarded it not. And it may well be that from hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> borrowed that expreſſion of his, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Behold the hire of your labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord of hoſts.</hi> See alſo the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>Of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, even great and fair without inhabitant;</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their owners ſhould be ſlain or carried into captivity; which was fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed at the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when after a great ſlaughter amongſt all ſorts of people, the Princes, Nobles, and rich men were carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo no body was left to dwell in their ſtately houſes. And this is mentioned as a puniſhment proportioned to their ſin in joining houſe to houſe, as was before ſaid. All the benefit they ſhould reap by the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlarging their houſes in ſuch a way, was, that they ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the enjoying of them, and their houſes ſhould be left deſolate and without an inhabitant. It is expreſſed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> with a conditional particle, <hi>If many houſes ſhall not be deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> But this is an Emphatical form of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſual in the Scriptures, wherein ſomewhat is left to be underſtood by thoſe that hear it, which is not expreſſed. It is as if the Lord had ſaid, If this comes not to paſs, as I have ſaid, let not me be owned for the true God; or, let me not be deemed a juſt God, a God of truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is well rendered in our Tranſlation, <hi>Of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42788:31"/>Ver. 10. <hi>Yea ten acres of Vineyard ſhall yield one bath, &amp;c.]</hi> Which was about eight gallons, ſee the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.26. ſo that an acre of ground planted with vines ſhould not yield to the owner one whole gallon of wine. <hi>And the ſeed of an homer,</hi> which was much about our buſhel, <hi>ſhall yield an ephah,</hi> and that was, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.11. <hi>the tenth part of an homer;</hi> and therefore conſequently the meaning muſt needs be, that their land ſhould not yield them above the tenth part of the ſeed that was ſown in it. Indeed <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.36. it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>that an homer is the tenth part of an ephah.</hi> But therefore I conceive the <hi>Omer,</hi> and the <hi>Homer</hi> were two different meaſures, as indeed they are differently alſo written in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> The <hi>Omer</hi> was a ſmaller meaſure, <hi>the tenth part of an Ephah,</hi> but the <hi>Homer</hi> was a far greater meaſure, the ſame with the Bath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.11. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ten Ephahs; and therefore it was a very heavy curſe of God upon their land, when they ſhould reap but one Ephah where they had ſown an Homer, which was ten Ephahs. As in the foregoing verſe the deſolation of their houſes was allotted as the puniſhment of their joining <hi>houſe to houſe;</hi> ſo here the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their land is threatned as a juſt and fit reward of their laying <hi>field to field;</hi> yet it may be alſo added, as the cauſe why their houſes ſhould be left deſolate. And beſides this is inferred fitly upon the foregoing Parable. Becauſe God had loſt his coſt and labour beſtowed upon them that were his Vineyard, therefore they ſhould loſe the coſt and labour they beſtowed upon their lands and Vineyards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning to follow ſtrong drink, &amp;c.]</hi> To wit, as purſuing it with all eagerneſs, being never well till they be at it, ſee the Note, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16. <hi>That continue until night,</hi> which is in the Original <hi>until twilight;</hi> and ſo the meaning may be, that they ſate at it, either from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to evening, or from morning to morning; <hi>till wine inflame them,</hi> to wit, with unnatural heat, and ſo inſtead of quenching, increaſeth their thirſt, and ſo they many times fall into burning fevers, and are as it were ſet on fire with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fury, and inflamed with burning luſts. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29-33.</p>

The things here named were not mentioned as evil in themſelves, but it is their exceſs herein, and their abuſe of them that is here condemned. And therefore it follows, <hi>but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands;</hi> that is, his judgments, to wit, either thoſe which God had already brought upon their land; (for it is moſt probable that this was ſpoken when in the days of <hi>Ahaz</hi> the <hi>Syrians, Pekah</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> had made great havock in <hi>Judea,</hi> yea when the Ten Tribes were already carried away captives into <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> And we ſee the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> condemns the ſame jollity upon this very ground, of their not laying to heart the ſad calamities that were befallen the Ten Tribes, <hi>But they are not grieved for the affliction of Joſeph,</hi> Amos 6.6.) Or elſe thoſe which did at this time hang over their heads, which God had threatned by his Prophets, and to which he had already begun to make way: which ſeems moſt probable, becauſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſpeaks of theſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. under this expreſſion, <hi>Let him make ſpeed and haſten his work.</hi> Yet I ſee not but that this may alſo be extended to their not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42788:31"/>
conſidering Gods works of Creation and Providence in general, concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 92.5, 6. ſo that this may be added to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the reaſon why they did ſo wholly give up themſelves to pleaſure, as if they had nothing elſe to do in the world, to wit, becauſe they did not by a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his work, lay to heart how great the Lord was whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by their ſins. Or, becauſe they did not conſider that God, the work of whoſe hands they were, and who had made, and by his Providence brought in to them all thoſe neceſſary Proviſions wherewith they were ſuſtained, had therefore done this, that they might fear and ſerve him, and not live as brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the beaſts do: And indeed well might ſuch men be charged with diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the works of God, becauſe gluttony and drunkenneſs do ſo overwhelm men, and even drown reaſon in them, that they mind nothing but their bellies; whence is that of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over-charged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs—and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, they ſhall certainly go into captivity; it is as ſure as if it were done already. It may be indeed the Ten Tribes were already carried away; but it is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity that is here threatned as the puniſhment of thoſe ſins which the Prophet had now reproved; <hi>becauſe they have no knowledg,</hi> to wit, to take notice of the danger they are in, by a due conſideration of the judgments, either incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them, or impendent over them; and ſo this may be ſpoken with reſpect to what he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>they regard not the work of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> or becauſe they are ſuch a ſenſual, ſenſleſs, and brutiſhly ignorant people; and therefore it is that by way of aggravating this their wilful ignorance from the ſpecial means which God had afforded them to make them an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, they are here called Gods peculiar people, <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, becauſe they have no knowledg;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Though I have given them my Law to enlighten them, and ſent my Prophets to teach them, yet through their profaneneſs and ſenſuality, they are as brutiſh as the very bruit beaſts, <hi>Wine and new wine take away the heart,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. and therefore they ſhall be carried away for ſlaves into a ſtrange land. <hi>And their honourable men are famiſhed;</hi> it is in the Original, <hi>their glory are men of famine;</hi> but the meaning is, That the great ones amongſt them that were in greateſt eſteem, and lived in all pomp and plenty, being generally accounted the glory of their Nation, ſhould be ſtarved for want of neceſſary food. Becauſe in times of ſcarcity, ſuch men might hope by their wealth and greatneſs to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves, therefore the famiſhing of theſe is particularly expreſſed. <hi>And their multitude,</hi> that is, the common people, <hi>dried up with thirſt,</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is meant of the ſtreights they ſhould be brought into both for meat and drink, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be beſieged by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And this is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a juſt reward of their ſin. They that had waſted and abuſed Gods good Creatures, when they had them in abundance, by luxury, gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, ſhould come at laſt not to have bread to eat, or water to drink.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Therefore, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, becauſe of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality that ſhall be amongſt the people by reaſon of the famine mentioned in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42788:32"/>

And this Expoſitors hold was accompliſhed, partly in thoſe that were godly of the poor left in the land, when the reſt were carried away captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.12. and partly in thoſe that at laſt returned out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> at which times it is moſt probable that many poor people that had been as ſo many helpleſs lambs driven out of their poſſeſſions, (or at leaſt their poſterity) did recover their own again, their mighty oppreſſors being deſtroyed, and ſo did live open in their inheritances after the manner as in former times they had done.

And accordingly by the <hi>cords of vanity,</hi> and the <hi>cart-ropes</hi> whereby they draw ſin upon themſelves, may be meant, either 1. all thoſe vain encouragements whereby they embolden themſelves in ſin, when conſcience, it may be, began to check them, and to ſtop them in their evil courſes, ſuch are mens preſumptuous deſpiſing the Judgments of God, or thoſe vain conceits that God regards not, nor minds the ways of men, or thoſe hopes of impunity and finding favour with God, which they ſuggeſt to themſelves, or the excuſes they deviſe for the juſtifying or extenuating of the evil they deſire to do; all which arguings, though weak in themſelves, yet through mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the inſtigation of Satan, do work ſtrongly upon mens hearts, and are as ſo many cart-ropes to draw on ſin, and are therefore called the ſnares of the Devil, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and 3.7.

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>That ſay, Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, that by adding ſin to ſin, and by running into all extremities of deſperate wickedneſs, do in a manner haſten, or provoke God to haſten judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves. But I conceive the Prophet doth plainly ſet forth the manner how theſe prophane wretches did deride and jeer the threatnings of Gods Prophets, <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work, that we may ſee it.</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, You Prophets talk much of ſome great thing which God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do ſuddenly by way of puniſhing us for our ſins, why is it not done? let him do it; we care not though he haſten his work, as you ſay he will: or, theſe words of ſcorn might be uſed to imply how little they believed what they ſaid,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42788:33"/>
and how confident they were that no ſuch thing ſhould be, <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work, that we may ſee it:</hi> you have threatned theſe things again and again with many terrible words, we wonder when we ſhall ſee it done; and to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>and let the counſel of the Holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael draw nigh and come, that we may know it,</hi> that is, that we may by the event ſee and know that God hath indeed determined of what you ſay, and ſo may ſenſibly feel and know it is ſo. I take it to be all one as if they had ſaid, you have talked long enough of what God in his counſel hath determined to do; why is the execution delayed ſo long? Let us ſee it at laſt ſpeedily brought to effect. And indeed the often repeating of the ſame thing, <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and let him haſten his work, and let the counſel of the Holy One of Iſrael draw nigh and come,</hi> and <hi>that we may ſee it, and that we may know it,</hi> doth plainly ſhew that this is mentioned, as ſpoken in a flouting manner; and the ſame I judg of their terming God, <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> Some indeed think that they might uſe this expreſſion ſeriouſly, to imply that <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael</hi> was not ſo changeable as utterly to caſt off and deſtroy that people to whom he had obliged himſelf by an everlaſting Covenant. But becauſe the whole is ſpoken in a way of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, and becauſe we find that our Prophet ſpeaking of God, was frequently wont to uſe this expreſſion of <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> (as we may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. and in many other places), therefore it is moſt probable that even this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they uſed alſo by way of jeering the Prophet. And this we may the rather think, becauſe the other Prophets do often complain of wicked mens mocking them for the words they ſpake in their Preaching to the people, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.8. <hi>The word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a deriſion daily;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.15. a place much like this, <hi>Behold, they ſay unto me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, &amp;c.]</hi> This may be applied, I confeſs, to thoſe that by the wickedneſs of their lives do contradict that which they know in their judgment, and ſo do by their practiſe ſeem to call that good, which in their Conſciences they know to be evil, and that evil which they know is good. But certainly the Prophet did hereby intend thoſe that did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay that evil was good, and good was evil, (which muſt needs argue a high degree of bold profaneneſs) and ſo did not only confound good and evil, vertue and vice, truth and error, making both alike approvable or diſapprovable; but alſo quite contrary to that which was juſt right, did prefer evil before good, approving of evil as fit to be loved and embraced, and condemning good as fit to be hated and rejected. And beſides, this is not meant of thoſe that meerly out of ſimple ignorance do err and miſtake in ſome ſmaller matters, but of thoſe that do in the generality judg perverſly of the whole way of good and evil; which if it be done out of judgment, is a high degree of brutiſhneſs, even that of being given up to a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. and muſt needs cauſe them to run out into an unbridled licentiouſneſs of doing evil; and if it be done againſt judgment and knowledg, argues deſperate obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of ſpirit. And yet this may be ſeveral ways, as when men call evil men, or their evil actions good by way of flattery, (ſee the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24.) or when men ſpeak evil of good men, or the good they do, or the good that is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42788:34"/>
in them, by way of calumny; or by way of excuſing, or juſtifying, or indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging themſelves in any way of wickedneſs, as when they ſhall call prodigality, bounty; or covetouſneſs, frugality; or on the other hand, zeal, madneſs; and patience, ſtupidity and cowardiſe, and ſuch like. As for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>That put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter;</hi> the ſame is expreſſed again in Metaphorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for by <hi>darkneſs</hi> is meant the evil of error and ſin which are uſually termed darkneſs in the Scripture, becauſe they proceed from the ignorance and blindneſs of mens minds, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. which is farthered much by the cunning of Satan, and power which he hath over them, who is therefore called <hi>the ruler of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. becauſe they affect ſecreſie and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11, 12. and cannot endure the light of the word, leſt the evil of their ways ſhould thereby be diſcovered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20. as likewiſe becauſe they make men lyable to the over-clouding darkneſs of Gods diſpleaſure here, and that utter eternal darkneſs which is provided to be the portion of the damned hereafter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. And on the contrary, goodneſs and truth it is that is here called <hi>light,</hi> as moſt frequently elſe where in the Scripture, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, and are wrought in us by the enlightening of his word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. becauſe they enable men to judg rightly of things, and to order their converſation aright, and makes them to be as ſo many bright ſhining lights in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. and becauſe they procure to men the light of Gods favour here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15, 16. and fit men for heavenly glory, <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. And ſo by <hi>bitter</hi> here is meant thoſe ways of ſin and wickedneſs, which though they may ſeem pleaſant for a time, yet they have no real ſweetneſs and delight in them, and will be ſure to prove moſt bitter in the end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.3, 4. and by <hi>ſweet,</hi> the ways of truth and holineſs, which are ever ways of pleaſantneſs, yielding us peace of Conſcience, and much ſweet refreſhing from the aſſurance of Gods favour, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. Only withal it ſeems apparent that theſe Metaphorical expreſſions are added on purpoſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that this miſcalling of things in the perſons here threatned, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from natural ignorance and infirmity, but from obſtinacy and malice, they did it againſt Conſcience in things that were manifeſt, evident and clear to the judgment of all men, as if they ſhould ſay that <hi>light</hi> were <hi>darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>bitter</hi> were <hi>ſweet;</hi> and ſo on the contrary, a man may be deceived in judging of things that are ſomewhat like one another; but who can miſtake in judging between light and darkneſs, and bitter and ſweet? A blind man cannot through miſtake ſay in the night that he ſees it light, and a ſick man cannot think that is ſweet which is bitter, though through the diſtemper of his palate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink;</hi> that is, to drink ſtrong drink. Becauſe they uſed in thoſe Countries to prepare and make ready the wine and other ſtrong liquors they were to drink, by mingling of them, (ſee the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2.) and ſo when they were once thus prepared and mixed, then they drank them up; therefore in the Scripture by mingling wine or ſtrong drink, is meant the pouring it out; as upon the ſame ground, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.14.

Yet I confeſs, becauſe by mingling of ſtrong drink may be meant the preparing and making it ready for others, therefore ſome Expoſitors would have the firſt clauſe underſtood of their might in drinking exceſſively themſelves, and the ſecond of their preſſing it upon others, and their contending to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come others in drinking.</p>

But that which I conceive is intended by theſe expreſſions is, that they ſhould be utterly deſtroyed, that as when the root of a fruit-tree is rotted in the earth, the whole tree preſently dieth and withereth, ſo that the very bloſſoms are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately parched, and blow away like ſo much duſt into the air, and there is no poſſibility that ever it ſhould bear fruit again, ſo ſhould it be with this Nation, <hi>their root ſhall be rottenneſs, and their bloſſom ſhall go up as duſt;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 18.16. But yet we muſt not underſtand this ſo as if the whole Nation ſhould be deſtroyed, (for a root of them were reſerved that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> beſides thoſe that were left alive in the land) but either it muſt be meant of the wicked multitude, or rather of the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in general, which in the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Captivity was indeed for a time ſo ruined, diſſipated and ſcattered, that in an ordinary way there ſeemed to be no hope of their recovery. And the reaſon of this is given in the following words, <hi>becauſe they have caſt away the Law of the Lord, and deſpiſed the word of the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> that is, they did not only in ſome few things through ignorance and infirmity tranſgreſs Gods commands, but they did maliciouſly caſt off all reſpect to his Law.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled againſt his people, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.14. <hi>And he hath ſtretched forth his hand againſt them, and hath ſmitten them;</hi> the Prophet intending here to foretell that dreadful judgment wherewith God had determined to accompliſh that utter ruin threatned in the foregoing verſe, he firſt begins with putting them in mind how terribly God had already of late years diſcovered his great indignation againſt them. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would have it, that the Prophet ſpeaks here of that dreadful judgment that was coming upon them, and that he expreſſeth it as if it were done already, <hi>He hath ſtretched forth his hand and hath ſmitten them,</hi> only to imply how certainly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42788:36"/>
it ſhould be, ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1. But the Context ſeems clearly to carry it, (which is alſo the judgment of the moſt and beſt Expoſitors) that firſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks here of the judgments he had brought upon them already, and then afterwards of that utter deſolation which God had determined ere long to bring upon them; and that becauſe by the mention of what they had ſuffered lately, he might beſt hint unto them, both their deſperate obſtinacy, in that they were not at all reformed by the ſad judgments that had already befallen them, and likewiſe their folly and madneſs in thoſe ſpeeches mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work, that we may ſee it, &amp;c.</hi> And though ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that which is here ſaid of the ſtrokes wherewith God had ſmitten them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to the great havock which the <hi>Syrians</hi> had made in <hi>Judah</hi> in the days of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.12, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> ver. 20. and which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had made in the days of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 King. 14.13, 14. yet it is better referred by others to thoſe grievous devaſtations and butcheries which had been made amongſt them of later times in the days of <hi>Ahaz</hi> by the <hi>Syrians;</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> and by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. And the hills did tremble;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, ſo dreadful were the ſtrokes of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that they might have made the hills to tremble. It is an Hyperbolical expreſſion, the better to ſet forth the ſtupidity of the people, that were not at all moved with theſe terrible Judgments; <hi>and their carcaſes were torn in the midſt of the ſtreets,</hi> to wit, with the wounds they received, when they were hacked and ſlain, or when they were hewed in pieces by their enraged enemies after they were dead. But the chief thing intended in theſe words, is to ſet forth, that the multitude of thoſe that were ſlain was ſo great, that they were not able to bury them, but they were left mangled in a pitiful manner, putrifying and rotting in their very ſtreets; and therefore ſome do tranſlate this paſſage thus, <hi>and their carcaſes were as dung in the midſt of the ſtreets;</hi> and then it follows to make way to the judgment threatned in the following verſe, <hi>for all this his anger is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> that is, he is again ready to fall upon them with a more dreadful judgment.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And he will lift up an enſign to the Nations from far, &amp;c.]</hi> Having in the foregoing verſe put them in mind how God had puniſhed them already, here now the Prophet makes known what that more terrible judgment was, which <hi>ver.</hi> 24. he had told them that God had determined farther ere long to bring upon them, and for the inflicting whereof he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>that his hand was ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> And becauſe this judgment intended was to be by an invaſion of foreign enemies from a very remote Country, as God had long before threatned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 28.49. (for which ſee the Notes there), therefore he uſeth this military word, that God would <hi>lift up an enſign</hi> (or a ſtandard) <hi>to the Nations from far;</hi> meaning that as ſome Prince or great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander doth by ſetting up his ſtandard invite Soldiers to come in and liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for his ſervice, and by lifting up an enſign doth call or lead out his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to march along, or to make an aſſault upon the enemy, ſo the Lord would by his ſecret Providence cauſe an army to be raiſed among the Nations that were afar off, and cauſe them to march out againſt the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to execute his Judgments upon his people. And to the ſame purpoſe are the next words,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42788:37"/>
                  <hi>and will hiſs unto them from the end of the earth;</hi> only this expreſſion, <hi>and will hiſs</hi> (or, <hi>whiſtle) to them,</hi> is uſed, I conceive, to imply how eaſily and quickly he could gather them together, and bring them upon his people; there would be no need of giving them an alarm by the ſounding of trumpets; if he did but hiſs or whiſtle for them, that would be enough. In the word <hi>(hiſs</hi> or <hi>whiſtle)</hi> there ſeems to be an alluſion to thoſe that have any ſo at their beck, as we uſe to ſay, that upon the leaſt notice given they are preſently ready to come in to them, (as to a maſter of a ſhip, who is thus by a whiſtle wont to call the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners about him to do what he commands them; or a ſhepherd that doth thus call in his ſtragling ſheep) or to thoſe that are wont by this way to call in thoſe that are out of ſight, they know not where or how far off, or at leaſt that are ſo far off that they cannot hear what they would ſay to them. And accordingly this expreſſion, <hi>And he will hiſs</hi> (or, whiſtle) <hi>unto them from the end of the earth,</hi> may be uſed, either with reſpect to the remoteneſs of the Nations that God ſhould call in (becauſe a hiſs, or whiſtle, is heard far off) or with reſpect to the ſecret working of Gods Providence in fetching in theſe Nations to deſtroy the <hi>Jews</hi> (becauſe hiſſing or whiſtling is a watch-word or warning covertly given to thoſe only that underſtand the meaning of it) or rather to imply how eaſily God could bring theſe Nations upon his people. It is a great Queſtion amongſt Expoſitors who this enemy was that God here threatens to raiſe up againſt his people. Some underſtand it of the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> who indeed utterly ruined the State of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and indeed theſe might moſt properly be ſaid to be called <hi>from the end of the earth.</hi> But becauſe the Prophet ſpeaks of a deſtruction that ſhould ſuddenly come upon them, and that of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ſo long after, even many years after the death of Chriſt, it is no way probable that this was here intended. Others think that it is the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that are here meant, who under <hi>Sennacherib</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did utterly waſte the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and carried the people into captivity, and made great havock in the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> beſieging the very City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though they took it not; and indeed obſervable it is, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it is clear the Prophet ſpeaks of the Invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> he ſpeaks much after the ſame manner as he doth here. But yet becauſe he ſpeaks here, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. of the utter ruining of the State of <hi>Judah,</hi> root and branch, I ſhould conceive it is rather meant of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who in the days of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> did waſte the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> take and burn the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carried the people cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> or at leaſt that it may be meant of both theſe jointly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one as the beginning, the other as the conſummation of that extreme ruin that was brought upon them. However it is clear that the reaſon why he ſpeaks of <hi>Nations</hi> in the Plural Number, was becauſe there were many ſeveral Nations, <hi>Parthian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

round about them were quiet, and at peace with them, not meaning them any hurt; therefore the Prophet tells them, that the Lord could eaſily, and would certainly bring in enemies upon them from the fartheſt part of the earth, that is, the fartheſt part known commonly to the people in thoſe times; <hi>and behold they ſhall come with ſpeed, ſwiftly,</hi> which is added by way of anſwering and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for that ſcornful ſpeech of theirs, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>None ſhall be weary,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, notwithſtanding the length of their journey: And hereby is implied, both what luſty able men they ſhould be, and likewiſe, how willingly and chearfully they ſhould undertake, and go on in this their expedition; <hi>nor ſhall ſtumble amongſt them,</hi> to wit, through wearineſs, or faintneſs, or by reaſon of any thing lying in their way, againſt which they might caſually daſh their foot. The meaning is, that nothing ſhould in the leaſt hinder or retard them in their jurney; <hi>none ſhall ſlumber nor ſleep,</hi> that is, they ſhall be ſo far from ſleeping, that they ſhall not ſo much as ſlumber, according as the ſame expreſſion is uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4. <hi>Behold, he that keepeth Iſrael ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi> It could not be, but they muſt ſleep ſometimes, but all is expreſſed here Hyperbolically. That which is intended, is, that they ſhould not go on in their journey, or do their buſineſs ſluggliſhly, and drowſily, but with much livelineſs, and prudent watchfulneſs, and intentive minding their work in hand. If there were need, they ſhould not refuſe to watch all night in their Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; or rather, to travel by night, as well as by day, as we find it expreſſed, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and let us go by night, and let us deſtroy her Palaces,</hi> Jer. 6.5. <hi>neither ſhall the girdle of their loins be looſed;</hi> that is, they ſhall be ſtill in a readineſs to march, or to perform any other ſervice of War; becauſe the girding of the loins helps to the ſtrengthening of men, and ſo is often uſed by them that undertake any jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or ſervice, whereto ſtrength is required. See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.46. Therefore ſome would have it, that this Phraſe, of not looſing <hi>the girdle of their loins,</hi> is uſed to imply their conſtant ſtrength. But queſtionleſs, the meaning rather is, that they ſhould not pull off their clothes to go into a bed, no, nor ſo much as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm themſelves; <hi>nor ſhall the latchet of their ſhooes be broken,</hi> to wit, as uſually it will be, when men in haſt pull off their ſhooes; and if ſo we take it, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be, that they ſhould not ſo much as pull off their ſhooes when they laid themſelves down, but becauſe a looſe ſhoo muſt needs be a great hinderance to men in travelling, and put them to ſome ſtay for the mending of it, I rather thus underſtand this expreſſion, that nothing ſhould befal them, to ſtay, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their way, not ſo much as the breaking of a ſhooe-latchet. So that the whole ſcope of the place is to imply, that they ſhould go on in their journey ſo proſperouſly, that they ſhould meet with no impediment that ſhould conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be any hinderance to them.

But ſee the Notes alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.4. and <hi>Job</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And in that day they ſhall roar againſt them, like the roaring of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they ſhall break in upon them with a noiſe, like that of the roaring Sea, when in a ſtorm it beats upon a Ship, or when over-bearing the banks it breaks in, and over-flows the land, and carries all before it, like a mighty deluge; <hi>and if one look unto the land, behold darkneſs and ſorrow</hi> (or <hi>diſtreſs</hi>), that is, ſaith ſome Expoſitors, if one of this ſavage Nation ſhall but look towards them, the very terror of his countenance ſhall over-whelm them with the darkneſs of extream dread and fear, and threaten no leſs than the bringing of the whole land under moſt extream miſery and ſorrow. But indeed this is far more generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Expoſitors, of the Inhabitants of the land: <hi>and if one look to the land, behold darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſo miſerable ſhall be the condition of the whole land, by reaſon of the irruption of ſo potent and cruel an enemy, that if any of the people did look towards any part of the land, as it were to view and conſider the ſad condition whereinto they were brought, they ſhould ſee nothing but darkneſs over-ſpreading the whole Country; which way ſoever they ſhould look round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, they ſhould no where diſcover the leaſt likelihood of help, there ſhould not be any light of hope and comfort to be ſeen. And becauſe in the firſt words of the Verſe it was ſaid, that the enemy ſhould <hi>rear againſt them like the roaring of the ſea,</hi> therefore ſome conceive, that in theſe words, <hi>and if one look to the land,</hi> &amp;c. there is an alluſion to a Ship in a great ſtorm at Sea, from whence the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners look to the land, as wiſhing themſelves there, but ſee no hope of eſcape thereby, and to the Heavens (of which there was mention indeed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words), but there is no appearance of the leaſt clearing in the sky. But I ſee not, but that without any ſuch alluſion, the following words, <hi>and the light is darkened in the Heavens thereof,</hi> that is, in the Heavens over the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> may be added to imply, that even from thence they ſhould have no hope of help or comfort, but all ſhould be darkneſs there, as well as on the land; whitherſoever they looked, upward or downward, they ſhould find themſelves in a ſad and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42788:38"/>
hopeleſs condition: Or elſe the meaning may be, that if any light of hope did appear, raiſing in them any expectation of help and deliverance, that ſhould end in nothing but miſery, and ſo ſhould only prove a vexation to them: or that their miſery ſhould be ſo great, that they ſhould take no comfort in the light of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no more than if it were overſpread with darkneſs; yea, it ſhould be irkſome and diſpleaſing to them. And indeed this muſt, I conceive, be intended, if we read this laſt clauſe as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>And when it is light it ſhall be dark in the deſtructions thereof.</hi> But ſee the Note <hi>Job</hi> 18.6. That affliction and ſorrow are termed <hi>darkneſs</hi> in the Scripture, and proſperity and joy and comfort, <hi>light,</hi> is apparent in many places. See the Notes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Job</hi> 18.18. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 112.4. and <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.16.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>IN the year that King Uzziah died,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not expreſly ſaid whether <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw this Viſion immediately before <hi>Uzziah</hi> died, or preſently after his death. But yet it ſeems moſt probable that it was immediately after the death of <hi>Uzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi> and that this, <hi>In the year that King Uzziah died,</hi> is all one as if he ſaid, In the very beginning of the reign of <hi>Jothan,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> preſently after the death of his Father <hi>Uzziah;</hi> 1. Becauſe the death of <hi>Uzziah</hi> ſeems purpoſely to be mentioned, to note, that it was upon that great change that was made by this Kings death, that God did now again confirm the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office. The coming in of new Kings doth many times cauſe great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and commotions in Kingdoms; and therefore to encourage the Prophet againſt any fears cauſed by this change, the Lord was pleaſed by this Viſion to confirm him again in his Prophetical Office. And 2. Becauſe the Prophet ſeems all along to divide his Prophecy according to the Reigns of the Kings in whoſe days he prophecied. In chap. 11. he names <hi>Uzziah</hi> as the firſt of the Kings under whom he propheſied; and accordingly it may be probably thought that from thence unto this place we have had the ſum of his Prophecies in the reign of <hi>Uzziah.</hi> Then 2. he tells us the Viſion he ſaw, and the charge which God gave him <hi>in the year that King Uzziah died;</hi> that is, in the very beginning of the reign of <hi>Jotham,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> who upon the death of <hi>Uzziah</hi> ſucceeded him in the throne. Again, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.1. He begins his Prophecy under the Reign of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jotham. And it came to paſs in the days of Ahaz the ſon of Jotham, the ſon of Uzziah, &amp;c.</hi> And then 4. in <hi>chap.</hi> 14.28. he adds his Prophecies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> uſing the ſame expreſſion he uſes here, <hi>In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden.</hi> But may ſome ſay, If the Prophet intended to ſhew that this Viſion was ſeen after the death of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> why did he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, that it was in that reign, or in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Jotham?</hi> I anſwer, Becauſe if he had expreſſed it ſo, it would have been queſtionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it had been in the beginning of <hi>Jothams</hi> reign, when he reigned together with his father, and as his Viceroy during all the time of his leproſie, or in the beginning of his reign when he came to be King in his own right, after the death of his father <hi>Uzziah,</hi> for which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5, 32. Indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have here a relation of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> call to his Prophetical Office, and becauſe he ſpeaks here of his ſeeing the Lord, (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) as a thing he had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, therefore there are ſome that think that this was his firſt Viſion, and ſhould therefore have been placed in the beginning of his Prophecy. But, 1. it is moſt improbable that he ſhould begin to Prophecy <hi>in the year that Uzziah died,</hi> concerning whom it is noted, that he did <hi>write the acts of Uzziah firſt and laſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.22. 2ly. Becauſe the Prophet was here enjoined to denounce that judgment that God had paſt againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſhould be given up to blindneſs of mind and hardneſs of heart, (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) it may be clearly from hence gathered, that he had Propheſied to them many years under <hi>Uzziah;</hi> and had experienced their obſtinacy, for which this ſentence was pronounced againſt them. And, 3ly, this Viſion therefore was not his firſt call to his Prophetical Office, but to confirm and encourage him herein, againſt all the oppoſition he had met with, or might meet with therein; as we ſee the Apoſtles Commiſſion was again and again renewed to them for their greater encouragement. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſidering with what Majeſty and Glory God preſented himſelf to the Prophet in this Viſion, it is no wonder though he were more than ordinarily aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and it may be he became hereby more ſenſible of the great weight of his Office; than he had been before. But it doth not follow that God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf to him as a Prophet before.</p>

And therefore the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> doth expreſly affirm that it was the Lord Chriſt that appeared to our Prophet in this Viſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.41. where having alledged that very ſentence which is here pronounced by the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. concerning the blinding of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he adds, <hi>Theſe things ſaid Iſaias, when he ſaw his glory, and ſpake of him.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> alledging the very ſame paſſage, ſaith, <hi>Well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt by Eſaias the Prophet.</hi> It was therefore the only true God, who is Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, that now appeared to <hi>Iſaiah, ſitting upon a throne,</hi> as the great King and Judg of the world, and ready now to pronounce a judicial ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> his peculiar people. <hi>High and lifted up,</hi> that is, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high, as before to expreſs the exceeding height of <hi>the cedars of Lebanon,</hi> it was ſaid they were <hi>high and lifted up;</hi> or <hi>high</hi> may have reſpect to the great height of the Throne in regard of the frame and making of it; and <hi>lifted up,</hi> to the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, in that it was ſeen aloft in the air very high above the earth; both being to ſet forth the incomprehenſible Majeſty of God, and how tranſcendently far this Heavenly judg is above all the Kings and Monarchs of the earth. <hi>And his train,</hi> that is, the skirts of his royal robes, or <hi>the skirts thereof,</hi> (as it is in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42788:39"/>
Margent) that is, the utmoſt parts of the Throne whereon he ſate, or, that which hang down of the covering which lay upon the Throne, <hi>filled the Temple,</hi> that is, the lower parts of the Temple. It ſeems clear by this, that this viſion was ſeen in the Temple, or in a repreſentation of the Temple, as likewiſe by that which follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. where it is ſaid that the <hi>poſts of the door moved</hi> at the cry of the Seraphim, and that <hi>the houſe was filled with ſmoke;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that <hi>one of the Seraphims had a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;</hi> and that this was to ſignifie, that it was that holy God whom they ſerved in the Temple, that now appeared to the Prophet; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> might ſee how vainly they boaſted ſo much in the Temple, whereas in this very Temple that dreadful ſentence mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. was now pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. As for that which is ſaid of his Trains filling the Temple, that might be to ſignifie that the leaſt ray of the Majeſty of God was greater than all the glory of man; or that the glory of God is ſpread throughout the Church; or that the benefits of Chriſts Mediatorſhip do redound from him to the repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Above it ſtood the Seraphims, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, above the Throne, right over againſt the Lord, whoſe head and upper parts, in that humane ſhape wherein he appeared, were lifted up far above the Throne. And theſe were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who appeared alſo in humane ſhape, as is evident by the mention that is made of their face and feet, and <hi>ver.</hi> 3. of their humane voice; and therefore alſo it is ſaid that they <hi>ſtood,</hi> to wit, before the Lord, in a way of reverence, as attending upon him, as Nobles are wont to ſtand about a King, and as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, always ready to do whatever he ſhall enjoin them; all being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet forth the aſtoniſhing glory of the Majeſty of God. As for the name that is here given them, <hi>Seraphims,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>burning,</hi> it is probable that they are ſo called either from their ardent love to God, or zeal for God, (ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11.) or from their purity, the ſwiftneſs and agility of their motion, and their unreſiſtable power, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4. or rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they appeared like flaming fire, as was ſuitable for the diſcovery of Gods fiery indignation againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> which is afterward ſet forth in that dreadful judgment, which <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. is pronounced againſt them. We cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, as ſome boldly do, that theſe <hi>Seraphims</hi> were a peculiar order of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the higheſt and neareſt to God of all; for though it may be probably ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from ſome other places of Scripture, that there is ſome order amongſt the Angels; yet this word <hi>Seraphims</hi> ſetting forth the nature, qualities, and imployments of the Angels in general, it cannot be concluded from hence, that the <hi>Seraphims</hi> were an order of Angels, diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Angels by that name. Concerning their number, there is nothing expreſſed. That there were but two of them (as ſome ſay) anſwerable to the Cherubims upon and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mercy-ſeat in the Tabernacle and Temple, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.7, 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.27. cannot be concluded from that which is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>that one cried to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſee the Note; rather we may probably think there were great multitudes of them, this tending moſt to ſet forth the infinite Majeſty of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Each one had ſix wings, &amp;c.]</hi> And this alſo was, as was the four wings of the Cherubims in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.6. to ſet forth the agility of their nature,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42788:40"/>
and the ſwiftneſs of their motions; as likewiſe it may ſignifie their mounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft in the knowledg of God, and their converſing on high. <hi>With twain he cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his face,</hi> not as if the holy Angels do not at all ſee God, (for our Saviour ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>That in Heaven the Angels do always behold the face of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>), but to imply how unable they were, and how unworthy fully to behold the reſplendent brightneſs of Gods glory; <hi>and with twain he covered his feet,</hi> which might be to imply either, 1. That the nature and motions of the Angels is hidden from men below; and that as the Angels are unable to behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, ſo neither are men able to behold the glory of the Angels. And, 2. that they do not ſatisfie themſelves in their Miniſtry, and in the ſervice which they perform to God, as being conſcious to themſelves, and aſhamed of their imperfection and infirmity, in compariſon of the infinite purity and perfection of God; concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.15. <hi>and with twain he did fly,</hi> that is, they ſtood with their wings ſtretched forth, and perhaps flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering continually, as ready to fly, (for it is not probable that the Prophet ſaw them flying to and fro) and hereby was ſignified their readineſs to do, and their ſwiftneſs in doing whatſoever God enjoins them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And one cried unto another, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, they cried together with one conſent, or they cried out by turns, as two Quires of Singers are wont to do, thereby exciting as it were, and ſtirring up one another; as it is ſaid the men and women did in that Song of Thankſgiving wherewith they bleſſed God, after their miraculous paſſage through the Red-ſea, ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.21. <hi>And ſaid, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Now this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold repetition of the word <hi>holy,</hi> is commonly ſaid to imply the Trinity of the Perſons in the unity of the Godhead. But I rather conceive that the intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to ſignifie, 1. The ſuperlative and tranſcendent eminency of Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both in himſelf (ſee the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2.) and in all his ways and works, yea and particularly in the judgment which was now to be pronounced againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> It is as if they had ſaid, Holy, yea, thrice-holy, infinitely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably holy unto all eternity is the Lord of Hoſts. 2. The zeal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence of the Angels in ſetting forth the Praiſes of God. And, 3. how baſe a thing it was in the <hi>Jews</hi> to forſake this holy God, and to follow after Idols. <hi>The whole earth is full of thy glory,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1. Yet ſome conceive that by this Clauſe the folly of the <hi>Jews</hi> is covertly taxed, who carried themſelves as if the glory of the Lord had been ſhut up, and were only to be ſeen in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the poſts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, at the voice of every one of the Seraphims, as they cried, (which expreſſion I conceive is proper enough, though many of them cried out jointly together, ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Or, at the voice of God that cried, to wit, either by a voice that came immediately from him, or by the voice of the Seraphims ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Praiſe; for though it be meant of the cry of the Angels, yet this may be called the voice of God crying by them, becauſe it was by his power, and not theirs, that this was effected, as it was Gods power that cauſed the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> to fall down at the ſound of the Rams-horns, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.20. It is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>And the posts of the Tranſomes,</hi> or, <hi>the Threſholds moved,</hi> that is, thoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42788:40"/>
above and beneath the door, whereto the ſide-poſts were faſtned. But the meaning is, that all the poſts, together with the door of the Temple that hung thereon, did ſhake and tremble. And this was queſtionleſs to ſignifie the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Gods anger now diſcovered, and the dreadfulneſs of the judgment now to be denounced againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> (ſee the Note above, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.25.) and the fearful commotion and trembling it ſhould, when it was accompliſhed, bring upon the people. Yea, and ſome add too, that it was a ſign of the overthrow of the Temple, together with the ceaſing of the Ceremonies that were uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And the like may be ſaid concerning the following Clauſe, <hi>and the houſe was filled with ſmoke;</hi> for this ſmoke filling the Temple, might be to ſignifie the wrath of God againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> (as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.8. <hi>There went up a ſmoke out of his noſtrils, &amp;c.</hi>) and that in the burning of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> yet as the Cloud that filled the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10. ſo this ſmoke filling the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be to ſignifie Gods preſence there, and ſo to aſſure the Prophet that it was the Lord that pronounced the following dreadful ſentence againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> yea, and ſome add, that the ſmoke ſignified the blinding of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Then ſaid I, wo is me, for I am undone, &amp;c.]</hi> The meaning of this is, that upon the ſight of that glorious apparition, wherein the Lord had preſented himſelf to him, and the hearing of that dreadful voice of the Angels, owning and admiring the infinite purity and holineſs of God, and the diſcovery that was made of Gods indignation, mentioned in the foregoing verſe, the Prophet was aſtoniſhed and terrified, as apprehending his very life to be endangered thereby, (concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13. <hi>&amp; Judg.</hi> 6.22. <hi>&amp; Exod.</hi> 33.20.) and that the rather becauſe theſe things did cauſe him preſently to reflect upon his own baſeneſs and impurity, as rendring him unworthy to ſtand before ſo glorious and ſo pure a God; as he expreſſeth it in the following words, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips:</hi> But why doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain only of the uncleanneſs of his lips? I anſwer, 1. Becauſe he was a Prophet; and ſo might apprehend that he had been too remiſs in reproving the ſins both of Princes and people, and conſequently might fear that he had been in part the cauſe of the peoples not being reclaimed from their ſins, and ſo of the Lords breaking forth now in ſuch high diſpleaſure againſt them. Or, 2. to imply gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that he was all over a poor unclean wretch, and one therefore that might juſtly fear, leſt the wrath of ſo holy a God might conſume and deſtroy him. In confeſſing the pollution of his lips, he doth withal imply that corruption of his nature which had tainted his tongue, (for <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> Mat. 12.34.) and ſo likewiſe the whole man; and it is therefore all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, I am all over unclean, and therefore unable as to ſpeak any thing from God or to God, as I ought to do; ſo alſo to perform any ſervice to him or for him, for which he might not juſtly be offended with me. But wherefore doth he add that, <hi>and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips?</hi> I anſwer, It may be only to imply, firſt that he was naturally no better than they, and that both he and they were a company of unclean creatures, whom God might juſtly deſtroy. Or, 2. that beſides his own pollution, he might juſtly fear, that his very dwelling amongſt a people ſo horribly wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, might bring him to be involved in the ſame puniſhments together with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42788:41"/>
them. Or rather, 3ly, that he might well think that he had contracted ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion by living in the midſt of ſuch a wicked people, it being very hard for a man to converſe amongſt ſuch, and not to be defiled by them, but to be as the fiſh that are freſh and ſweet, though they live conſtantly in the ſalt-ſea; and haply the contagion which he feared he had contracted in his lips, might be, that their contumacy had made him, either out of a cowardly fear of them, or out of deſpair of doing any good upon them, more remiſs in contending with them, than he ſhould have been.</p>

                  <hi>For mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts,]</hi> See the Note above <hi>ver.</hi> 1. But why was the Prophet thus affrighted? I anſwer, conſidering the exceeding glory and dread of the Viſion, it was no wonder though he were for a time thus ſtartled. And beſides it was one chief end of the Viſion, by the diſcovery of Gods Majeſty and glory, both to humble the Prophet that he might the more reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend upon him and receive his commands, and likewiſe to ſtrengthen and encourage him to go on couragiouſly in his office, notwithſtanding all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he might meet with, in the confidence of the greatneſs of his Lord, that had given him his Commiſſion.</p>

Here begins the relation of that which God had ordered to be done, to quiet the troubled mind of the Prophet, to free him from his fears, and to confirm and encourage him in his Prophetical office, and particularly in that ſervice that was now to be impoſed on him of making known Gods decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the blinding of the <hi>

Becauſe the ſign was fire from the altar, and ſo fire from Heaven, it was the fitter to ſignifie that no purity of man is from himſelf, but from God in Chriſt, the expiatory ſacrifice of Chriſt, and from the ſanctify my ſpirit of Chriſt, which is therefore often compared to fire, as <hi>Mat.</hi>

It is the will of God by withdrawing or withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſpirit, thus to leave you to your own perverſe and ſtubborn hearts, that ſo nothing you hear or ſee may do you any good. And ſo indeed in other places this paſſage of the Prophets is cited, as importing Gods puniſhing their wilful refuſing to receive good by the means of grace, by giving them up to farther blindneſs and obſtinacy, as we may ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>&amp; Rom.</hi> 11.8. All which was intended concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> not only in the days of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but alſo in the days of the Goſpel, even unto this time, as is evident by the frequent applying of this Prophecy to them in the New Teſtament. And it was the will of God to make known that he would thus puniſh them by with-holding his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace, and leaving them to the power of Satan, and the perverſeneſs of their own hearts: 1. That he might teach the Prophet not to ſtartle at it, but to ſtoop to the will of God herein, if he found that he laboured in vain in ſeeking to reclaim a rebellious people; (for when he was to tell them thus of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, <hi>Hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, &amp;c.</hi> it was all one in effect as if he had ſaid, I know I ſhall do no good amongſt you; but for that I muſt ſubmit to the will of God.) And, 2ly, withall that the people might be warned to take heed that by their obſtinacy they did not bring this ſpiritual judgment upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But why would God ſend the Prophet to them, if he foreſaw that he would not obey him, and intended therefore to puniſh them by giving them over to greater blindneſs and hardneſs of heart? I anſwer, 1. Becauſe however here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the patience and mercy of God was magnified in uſing this means to reclaim ſuch an obſtinate people. 2. Becauſe hereby the people were left the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. And, 3. Becauſe ſome might be converted by the Prophets teaching, though the generality of the people continued blind and incorrigible; for this judgment was denounced againſt the body of the people jointly conſidered, and not againſt every particular perſon amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 15.27. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 119.7. In this expreſſion there ſeems to be an alluſion to that fat we call ſuet, which when it is cold will grow ſtiffer and harder than other fat uſeth to be; and ſo the fatneſs of the heart here intended may be ſuch a frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of heart and ſpirit, as renders men not only dull and unteachable, but alſo ſtiff, obſtinate, and untractable. <hi>And make their ears heavy,</hi> that is, make them deaf, or thick or dull of hearing; for as we uſe to ſay of thoſe that hear well, that they are light of hearing; ſo of thoſe that hear ill, that they are heavy and dull of hearing; and the heavineſs of hearing here intended is, when men take no delight in Gods word, when they are ſtupid and blockiſh, or are no more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with what is ſpoken to them, than if they heard not what was ſaid. <hi>And ſhut their eyes,</hi> that is, cloſe them up and make them dim. But now all this muſt not be ſo underſtood, as if the Prophet were enjoined to intend, deſire, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do what is here ſpoken. Only the Lord doth hereby give him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42788:42"/>

But yet go on courageouſly; ſince they will harden their hearts, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened let them be; and go thou on in doing that which belongs to thee, though they become thereby the more ſtupid and ſtubborn. See the Notes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. It is true indeed that it is not the natural effect of the word thus to blind and harden mens hearts. Only God foretells that accidentally this ſhould come to paſs, by reaſon of the obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that God in his juſt wrath would ſuffer it to be ſo, by with-holding his grace and leaving them to the baſe perverſeneſs of their own ſpirits; that as ſore and weak eyes are dazled and blinded with any great light, and tender ears are ſtunned and deafned with any great noiſe, and as lime burns by the pouring of water upon it, ſo the Preaching of the Prophet ſhould make them more blind and ſottiſh, more hard-hearted and ſtubborn than they were before, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.39. <hi>For judgment I am come into this world; that they which ſee not might ſee; and that they which ſee, might be made blind.</hi> And indeed this meſſage here commended to the Prophet concerning the peoples obſtinacy, <hi>Make the heart of this people fat; and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes,</hi> ſeems to be expreſſed in theſe terms purpoſely to imply how ſtrange a thing this was, that his holy endeavours ſhould bring forth an effect ſo contrary to what he deſired, and that God in his juſt wrath ſhould deſign him hereto; which is fully expreſſed in the following words, <hi>leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed,</hi> to wit, 1. by the pardoning of their ſins, according to that expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>With his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> and ſo the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12. <hi>Leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi> 2. By the healing of their corruptions, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their lives.

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lord, how long? &amp;c.]</hi> That is, how long ſhall this people continue in this ſad condition, being blinded and hardened, yea, and made more and more rebellious and refractory by the Preaching of thy ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom thou ſendeſt unto them? as if he had ſaid, is there no end or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod ſet to this their rejection? And this it ſeems the Prophet ſpake, both by way of wondering at this judgment denounced, out of a ſollicitous care for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and out of pity and compaſſion towards them; and likewiſe as being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thereto by a ſecret inſtinct from God, that in the anſwer which God return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it might be made known with what great ſeverity he meant to proceed againſt them. <hi>Until the cities,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Judah, be waſted without inhabitant, and the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without man, and the land be utterly deſolate;</hi> that is, until by the incurſion of ſeveral enemies under the reign of the ſeveral Kings that ſhall ſucceſſively ſit in the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> the inhabitants of the land ſhall be exceedingly waſted and deſtroyed, ſo that at laſt both cities, and particular houſes ſtanding by themſelves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42788:43"/>
ſhall be in a manner left deſolate without any to inhabit them. And this extream deſolation and havock that was made amongſt them might be intended concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great deſtruction which was brought upon them, by the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and yet it may be extended alſo to that extream devaſtation that was made in that land by the <hi>Romans,</hi> namely by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> firſt, and afterwards by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> the Emperour.

(The ſame expreſſion is again afterward uſed concerning the Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 26.15. <hi>Thou hadſt removed it far unto all the ends of the earth), and there be a great forſaking in the midſt of the land,</hi> that is, and by this means the land ſhall be in a great meaſure totally, in a manner, forſaken of her inhabitants, and ſo ſhall be left deſolate. It is not therefore Gods forſaking of this people (as ſome think) but the lands being forſaken of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the Prophet here intends, and that was when the people were forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly carried away into <hi>Babylon.</hi> Yet ſome I know extend this, as is ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note, to that great deſolation that was made in the land by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they that were left were diſperſed and ſcattered all the world over.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>But yet in it ſhall be a tenth.]</hi> Some learned Expoſitors do underſtand this of <hi>a tenth</hi> King that ſhould ſit in the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> or of a Decade of Kings that ſhould ſucceſſively reign in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> before that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was to come upon the land that was threatned in the foregoing verſes. And indeed from the time when this was propheſied, (which was in the days of <hi>Jotham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> (ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) unto the time when the people were carried captives into <hi>Babylon</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> there were juſt ten Kings, that ſwayed the Scepter of <hi>Judah,</hi> to wit, <hi>Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manaſſeh, Amon, Joſiah, Jehoahaz, Jehojakim, Jehojachin,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> But by the general current of Expoſitors it is far better underſtood of a ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people, as it were one in ten, that ſhould be left in the land, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a like expreſſion, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.3. <hi>The city that went out by a thouſand, ſhall leave an hundred; and that which went forth by a hundred, ſhall leave ten to the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Leſt the faithful ſhould be too much dejected at the mention of that utter devaſtation that ſhould be made in the land, this promiſe is annexed for their comfort, that the people ſhould not be ſo univerſally deſtroyed and rooted out, but that there ſhould be a ſmall remnant of them left; which may be meant both of thoſe few that were left in the land, when the generality of the people were carried away captives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> or of that remnant that ſhould be brought back out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſetled again in their own land. And it may well be, that theſe are the rather called a <hi>tenth,</hi> with reſpect to the reformation that ſhould be wrought in thoſe that were reſerved, or to Gods preſerving the faithful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them from the common deſtruction, thereby to imply that they ſhould be, as indeed the tythes of the land was, holy to the Lord, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall return, and ſhall be eaten, &amp;c.]</hi> Some read this, as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of our Bibles, <hi>When it is returned and hath been brouſed;</hi> and they take the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42788:43"/>
meaning of the words to be, that when that remnant ſhould return out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> that had been ſo miſerably eaten and brouſed, cropt and deſtroyed, both before and in the captivity, there ſhould be but <hi>a tenth</hi> of them in compariſon of what they formerly were. But if we read the words as they are in our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then either no more is intended by this, <hi>It ſhall return, and ſhall be eaten,</hi> then if it had been ſaid, <hi>it ſhall be eaten again;</hi> meaning, that this remnant ſhould be again waſted. For this is an Hebraiſm frequent in the Scripture, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>the ſtreet ſhall return and be built, for the ſtreet ſhall be built again.</hi>) Or elſe the meaning muſt needs be, that after the return of this remnant, this tenth, out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even they ſhould be much waſted and conſumed; which was often done by the rage of their enemies againſt them after their return from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity. <hi>As a teil-tree, and as an oak whoſe ſubſtance is in them, when they caſt their leaves; ſo the holy ſeed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof:</hi> That is, as when theſe trees do caſt their leaves in winter, and ſo ſeem to be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite dead for the time, yet there is a lively ſap remaining in the root or body of the trees, which keeps them alive, and ſo is the ſubſtance or ſubſiſtence of them, by reaſon whereof in the ſpring they ſprout out again; ſo when my people ſhall ſeem to be utterly waſted and deſtroyed, yet there ſhall be a ſmall remnant left, <hi>a holy ſeed</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9.) a ſeed of Saints, which ſhall be as the life, and the ſubſtance and ſubſiſtence of this people, by reaſon of whom this my Church and people ſhall be continued in all ſucceeding times, ſo that they ſhall never be utterly raced out and deſtroyed. Some think <hi>the teil-tree</hi> (or, line-tree) <hi>and the oak,</hi> are here particularly inſtanced in, becauſe theſe trees, bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth later in the ſpring than other trees, are longer ere they loſe their leaves in the Autumn, and ſo were fitter to repreſent the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> which continued in a ſafe condition after the people of the Ten Tribes were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. But I rather think, that becauſe <hi>the teil-tree,</hi> by reaſon of its ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branches, and exceeding florid beauty, and <hi>the oak</hi> being a ſtrong tree, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in the earth, and uſually very long lived, ſeem moſt unlike to become as dead in winter, therefore they are choſen to ſet forth the ruin of the State and Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> which by reaſon of her proſperous and flouriſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeemed moſt unlike to be brought ſo low. Or rather, becauſe the Church and people of God, when they came to ſpring up again, ſhould like theſe trees ſpread forth their boughs and branches very far.

This <hi>Ahaz</hi> (whoſe father and grandfather <hi>Jotham</hi> and <hi>Uzziah</hi> are here mentioned, becauſe under theſe, and theſe only <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had hitherto Propheſied) was one of the moſt wicked Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42788:44"/>
yet in his reign the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent with many comfortable Propheſies to him, and to the people, for the ſupport and eneouragement of the faithful (as we may well think) in thoſe evil times; amongſt which this is one which is here related; the occaſion whereof is ſaid to be, <hi>that Rezin King of Syria, and Pekah the ſon of Remaliah, King of Iſrael,</hi> (Nations that were uſually at great enmity one againſt another) <hi>went up towards Jeruſalem to war againſt it;</hi> for being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the ſucceſsful invaſions they had already made upon the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> each of them ſeverally by their own forces, wherein they had ſlain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their great ones that were a chief ſtay and ſupport of their State, and huge multitudes of the flower of the people beſides, they aſſured themſelves, that if they now joined their forces together, they ſhould eaſily ſubdue this diſheartened broken people, and thereupon reſolved to go up together and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which accordingly they did, chuckering themſelves no doubt with hope of a full conqueſt, and the huge ſpoil they ſhould carry away from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> (concerning all which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.5.) <hi>but could not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it;</hi> which is premiſed before-hand, to hint how cauſleſs thoſe their fears were, which are here afterward related, and how baſe their incredulity was, and neglect of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And it was told the houſe of David, ſaying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim, &amp;c.</hi> That is, tidings were brought to the Court of <hi>Judah,</hi> to <hi>Ahaz</hi> the King, who was of the lineage of <hi>David,</hi> and to the other Princes and Officers of his Court and State, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the Ten Tribes, who are here called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (for which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.9.) had made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy together againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But why is this expreſſed thus, <hi>that it was told the houſe of David,</hi> and not that tidings were brought to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> or to the Houſe or Court of <hi>Ahaz?</hi> I anſwer, that probably we may think it was, either 1. To hint the reaſon why this confederacy againſt <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſhould come to nothing, namely, becauſe he was the lawful heir of the Crown, being deſcended from <hi>David,</hi> and God would make good his promiſe to <hi>David</hi> concerning the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of his Kingdom, ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16. Or elſe, (as ſome think) to imply how far <hi>Ahaz</hi> was degenerated from the courage of <hi>David,</hi> and other his holy anceſtors, as was diſcovered in that baſe fear of his at this time, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the following words, <hi>and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind;</hi> that is, as the leaves of trees will quiver and ſhake with the firſt breathing of the wind, when a tempeſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo did their hearts tremble and ſhake (as we uſe to ſay, like an aſpin leaf), at the firſt breath of that report that was brought to them, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations that were made againſt them by theſe two Kings; all which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to ſhew that the deliverance of this people at this time was only of God, or to ſet forth the wonder of the deliverance, where both Princes and people were ſo faint-hearted that they were no way able to make any reſiſtance againſt the mighty forces that were breaking in upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Then ſaid the Lord unto Iſaiah, &amp;c.]</hi> Though <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſought not to God or his Prophets for help or counſel, yet he ſent his Prophet to him, with a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that he would deliver him and his people from the danger they were in, 1. To magnifie the riches of his long-ſuffering and mercy towards the worſt of

men. 2. To render <hi>Ahab</hi> and his people the more inexcuſable. And, 3. for the ſupport and comfort of the faithful that were amongſt them. <hi>Go forth now,</hi> to wit, out of the city, as appears by that which follows, <hi>to meet Ahaz;</hi> he was ſent to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> both in regard of the greatneſs of his terrors, and in regard the care of providing for the publick ſafety lay chiefly upon him. Nor was he to ſtay till the King came back to the City, but to <hi>go forth to meet him,</hi> both to expreſs that reſpect and reverence which was due to him as King, and becauſe this was ſuitable for him that had ſuch good tidings to carry to the King. And as for that command that is given the Prophet for carrying his Son along with him, <hi>Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-jaſhab thy Son,</hi> we muſt know, 1. That <hi>Shear-jaſhab</hi> is, being interpreted, <hi>the remnant ſhall return.</hi> 2. That this name had been before given to this Son of the Prophet, either by the expreſs command of God, or by the ſecret inſtinct of Gods Spirit, purpoſely as a ſign, either, 1. of a remnant that ſhould <hi>return</hi> from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, which the Prophets did often foretell. (See the Notes before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.13.) Or, 2. of a remnant that ſhould repent and return unto God, from whom they had departed, after <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheribs</hi> army was deſtroyed before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> according to that expreſs place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.21. <hi>The remnant ſhall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God,</hi> for which ſee the Note there. And indeed many of thoſe that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were ſuch as had been purged and reformed by their afflictions, and brought home unto God. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.13. And 3ly, that the Prophet was enjoined to take this his Son <hi>Shear-jaſhab</hi> along with him, that he might ſtand by as a viſible ſign of the deliverance now promiſed, and of the ground of it, to wit, Gods purpoſe ſtill to preſerve a remnant in this people, that, ſhould be as a holy ſeed for the perpetuating of the Church in future times. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.13. and upon the 15 and 16 verſes of this Chapter. And hence it ſeems probable, that the reaſon why this name <hi>Shear-jaſhab</hi> was given to this Prophets Son, was commonly known; for elſe his going along with his father to the King would have been to no purpoſe at all. And then for the place whither the Prophet is ſent to meet <hi>Ahaz, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the high-way</hi> (or, <hi>cauſey-way) of the fullers field;</hi> this is thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed both to clear the certainty of the ſtory, and to aſſure the Prophet of the certainty of this Prophecy. We read of two Pools that were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the one called <hi>the lower Pool,</hi> we find mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Ye gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the waters of the lower pool,</hi> becauſe it lay on the weſt-ſide of the lower City; and another called <hi>the upper pool,</hi> made for the receiving and retaining of the waters that came from the fountain of <hi>Gihon,</hi> and ſituate on the ſouth-ſide of the upper City, the ſame as ſome think, that is elſe-where called <hi>the pool of Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the high-way of the fullers field.</hi> What the cauſe was of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his being in this place, is not expreſſed. Some think that hearing of theſe ſad tidings in ſome place, whither he had removed his Court out of the City, he was now coming to ſhelter and ſecure himſelf in this his chief City; and ſo the Prophet was ſent forth to meet him there, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him with a promiſe from God concerning the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he might not farther diſhearten the people by coming in ſuch a fright into the City. But then again others conceive, that he was gone thither, or come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſome place abroad, that he might conſult about the fortifying of that place, either becauſe they feared it might be a place of advantage for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whereby to enter the City, or becauſe it was a matter of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſecure the waters of this Pool for the uſe of the City when it ſhould be beſieged, and ſo the Prophet was ſent thither, as it were, to tell them in the midſt of theſe their conſultations, that the Lord whom they minded not, would be inſtead of fortifications to the City, and would ſecure it from the enemy, though they were not able to do it. And this indeed ſeems moſt probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> when he went to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did make his firſt approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the City at this place, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.17. and at that time <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had taken all the care he could to ſecure theſe waters, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And ſay unto him, take heed and be quiet, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, take heed of being thus unquiet and reſtleſs in thy mind as thou art; beware of all diſtruſt, and diſtruſtful fears; be not diſturbed and diſtracted, but be of a quiet compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mind, truſting in God; look not after help from the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or any other foreign aid, but rely wholly upon Gods protection, and his bleſſing upon thine own forces. And this laſt we may the more probably think was here intended, becauſe it is expreſly ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.7. that <hi>Ahaz</hi> did immediately after the invaſion of theſe two Kings, ſend to <hi>Tiglath-pileſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> for aid, and therefore it may well be that he had this already in his thoughts, <hi>Fear not, neither be faint-hearted</hi> (it is in the <hi>Hebrew, Let not thine heart be tender,</hi> that is, ſoft and apt to take an impreſſion of fear) <hi>for the two tails of theſe ſmoking fire-brands;</hi> ſo he calls theſe two Kings and their forces, of whom <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people were ſo exceedingly afraid, by way of contempt and ſcorn. He terms them <hi>fire-brands,</hi> becauſe indeed they were coming out againſt him with ſuch fury and ſeeming terror, as if they meant to ſet all the land on a light flame, and with fire and ſword to conſume all before them. But withal he calls them only <hi>tails of fire-brands;</hi> which might well be both with reſpect to what had formerly befallen theſe Kings (for indeed their power had been of late already much waſted, the <hi>Syrians</hi> by three great victories which <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> obtained over them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.25. and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by their own Civil Wars and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.10) and likewiſe with reſpect to the approaching ruin of both their Kingdoms; for it was not long e're <hi>Pekah</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.30. and both the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were utterly deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ſo that in this regard they might well be compared to the ends or tails of two fire-brands, their dominion and tyranny not being like to laſt long. Yea, he terms them not burning, but <hi>ſmoaking fire-brands,</hi> and that to imply, that though they might be a great vexation to them (as ſmoke is to the eyes), and a great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42788:45"/>
terror and affrightment, yet there ſhould be more pride and terror in them, than ſtrength and power for the effecting of the miſchief they intended; which yet muſt be underſtood with reſpect to their great deſign of taking <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the utter ſubverting of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> for otherwiſe we find, that when they raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and went away, the <hi>Syrians</hi> did make much ſpoil in other parts of the land. And to the ſame purpoſe is the following Clauſe, where he calls <hi>Pekah</hi> (by way alſo of contempt, becauſe his father was an obſcure private perſon) <hi>the ſon of Remaliah; for the fierce anger of Rezin, with Syria, and of the ſon of Remaliah.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Becauſe Syria, Ephraim, and the ſon of Remaliah, &amp;c.]</hi> Even this alſo is ſpoken by way of contempt: He vouchſafes not ſo much as to name theſe two Kings, by the report of whoſe confederacy they were ſo exceedingly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but terms them the <hi>Syrian, and the ſon of Remaliah</hi> (See the foregoing Note) <hi>have taken evil counſel againſt thee,</hi> that is, moſt unjuſt, wicked and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous counſel, tending to the utter ruin of Gods people, and the utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> the race and Royal power of <hi>Davids</hi> family; which is the rather mentioned (together with that confident reſolution of theirs related in the following verſe), becauſe all this tended the more to ſet forth their great danger, and ſo the mercy of the now promiſed deliverance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Let us go up againſt Judah, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, againſt the Land or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah. And vex it,</hi> to wit, by invading and ſpoiling the land, and by beſieging their chief City, <hi>Jeruſalem. And let us make a breach therein for us,</hi> that is, let us violently break in upon it, or thorough it, and ſurprize it, and make it ours. Yet ſome think, that becauſe the great deſign which they had in their thoughts, was the beſieging of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> therefore the <hi>breach</hi> here intended was the making a breach in the walls thereof, at which they might enter and take the City; and others underſtand it of making a <hi>breach</hi> or diviſion amongſt the inhabitants of the land or City; that being likely to tend much to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and others of dividing the land betwixt them, each of them taking that part which lay moſt convenient for them. But the firſt Expoſition I conceive is the beſt, and moſt agreeable to that which follows, <hi>Let us make a breach therein for us, and ſet a King in the midſt of it, even the ſon of Tabeal;</hi> for this man they intended doubtleſs to ſet up as a Viceroy, or a Tributary-King over the land, and one that ſhould hold the Kingdom of them, and be wholly at their diſpoſing. But now who this <hi>ſon of Tabeal</hi> was, is altogether uncertain; that which is ſaid by ſome of his being a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and by others of being ſome eminent man of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that was a known enemy to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> are but meer conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. But ſee the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, It ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs.]</hi> That is, Though they have with ſuch proud and bold confidence reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that they will thus diſpoſe the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſubject it to themſelves, yet this which they have thus determined ſhall not take effect and be eſtabliſhed, as they have determined it ſhall be. So far ſhall they be from making the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> theirs, as they have reſolved, that they ſhall not be able to effect that which they have determined concerning their taking of the City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> all they attempt herein, ſhall come to nothing.</p>

The deſign they have in hand for the enlarging of their Dominions ſhall not proſper. Neither ſhall <hi>Damaſcus</hi> become the head of <hi>Judea,</hi> by having dominion over that land; nor ſhall <hi>Rezin</hi> become King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as he makes account to be; but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall continue under the Government under which God hath ſet them. And indeed moſt fully was this made good within a ſhort time, when the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> called into the help of <hi>Ahaz, took Damaſcus, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and ſlew Rezin,</hi> 2 King. 16.9.</p>

                  <hi>And within threeſcore and five years ſhall Ephraim be broken; that it be not a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.]</hi> That is, And the people of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, ſhall be within threeſcore and five years ſo broken in pieces, notwithſtanding their great confidence in their preſent confederacy with <hi>Rezin,</hi> and his <hi>Syrians,</hi> that they ſhall no longer <hi>be a people,</hi> that is, a diſtinct State and people, living apart by themſelves, in their own land, and under their own Laws and Princes, and Government. But now the great queſtion is, how theſe <hi>threeſcore and five years</hi> muſt be reckoned, after which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to ceaſe to be a people; and that becauſe the taking of <hi>Samaria</hi> by <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away of the Ten Tribes out of their native Country into his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was in the ninth year of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> which was the ſixth of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> See the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.5, 6. Now if we account from the beginning of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his reign to that Captivity of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that makes in all but two and twenty years; for <hi>Ahaz</hi> reigned in all but ſixteen years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2. to which add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſix years of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his ſon (in whoſe ſixth year this great calamity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the Ten Tribes) the whole amounts (I ſay) to no more than two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. And yet becauſe the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> had before this ſeverally invaded the land of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Ahaz</hi> his time (as is noted before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) therefore it is moſt probable that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Propheſied this in the third year of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> and then from thence to <hi>Shalmaneſers</hi> carrying away the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> captive, there could be no more than about twenty years. The moſt ordinary anſwer that is given by Expoſitors for the reſolving of this hard queſtion is, that theſe <hi>threeſcore and five years</hi> are to be numbred, not from the time when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpake theſe words, but from the time when the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> did firſt foretell this utter deſtruction of the land and people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which that he did very expreſly is evident in many places of his Propheſie. And indeed it is clear that <hi>Amos</hi> began to Prophecy <hi>two years before the Earthquake in the days of Uzziah,</hi> Amos 1.1. (of which there is alſo mention made, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Ye ſhall flee like as ye fled from before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in the days of Uzziah.</hi>) Now if this Earthquake was in the ſeven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s reign, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers affirm it was, juſt about the time when <hi>Uzziah</hi> was ſmitten with a leproſie; then it follows that <hi>Amos</hi> began to Prophecy in the five and twentieth year of <hi>Uzziah;</hi> from whence if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the account of the time prefixed by <hi>Amos</hi> for the utter ruin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there will be ſeven and twenty years left behind of the reign of <hi>Uzziah</hi> (for he reigned in all two and fifty years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.2.) To which if we add the ſixteen years
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42788:46"/>
of his Son <hi>Jothams</hi> reign, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.33. and the ſixteen of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2. and ſix of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (in the ſixth year of whoſe reign <hi>Samaria</hi> was taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.10.) theſe make in all juſt <hi>threeſcore and five years.</hi> Yea, and the ſame account of years they make up alſo by reckoning the years of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for <hi>Amos,</hi> they ſay, began to Prophecy in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, who reigned in all forty and one years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.23. and if ſo, then he reigned four and twenty years after <hi>Amos</hi> Propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Captivity of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to which adding the ten years of <hi>Menahems</hi> reign, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.17. (not accounting the ſhort reigns of <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Shallum,</hi> which made up together but ſeven months) and the two years of <hi>Pekahiah,</hi> 2 King. 15.23. and the twenty years of <hi>Pekah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.27. and the nine years of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> in whoſe ninth year <hi>Samaria</hi> was taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2 King. 17.6. this alſo makes juſt <hi>threeſcore and five years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it may ſeem ſtrange that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhould ſpeak of the deſtruction of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after <hi>threeſcore and five years,</hi> only becauſe <hi>Amos</hi> Propheſied of their deſtruction ſo many years before it came to paſs; to this it is anſwered, that <hi>Amos</hi> did not only foretel this ruin that ſhould come upon the Kingdom and people of the Ten Tribes, but did alſo prefix the time when it ſhould be, namely after <hi>threeſcore and five years,</hi> which hereupon paſſing by tradition from one to another, was common in mens mouths, and was often mentioned by the ſucceeding Prophets, as the period appointed by God to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that ſo it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as if he had ſaid, that within that <hi>threeſcore and five years,</hi> which were ſo long ſince foretold, and were ſo commonly ſpoken of, <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould be ſo broken that they ſhould no longer be a people. And indeed could this be made out, a very obſervable aggravation this would have been of <hi>Pekah,</hi> and his <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bold prophaneneſs and contempt of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that after ſo fair a warning given ſo long before, wherein the time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned when they ſhould ceaſe to be a people, they ſhould be ſo far from fearing the threatned ruin, that they ſhould with ſo much confidence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a deſign for the ſwallowing up of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> But the truth is, that this computation of the <hi>threeſcore and five years</hi> here mentioned, is built upon meer uncertain conjectures: as, 1. That <hi>Amos</hi> did foretel that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be carried away captives <hi>within threeſcore and five years,</hi> of which there is no mention at all in his Prophecy. And, 2. that the great Earthquake, two years before which <hi>Amos</hi> begun to Prophecy, was in the ſeven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Uzziahs</hi> reign, which can be no way made out from the Scripture. Or, 3ly, that this was juſt at the time when <hi>Uzziah</hi> was ſmitten with a leproſie. And, 4. that <hi>Amos</hi> began to Prophecy in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Jerobeam</hi> the ſecond. And indeed neither of theſe two laſt aſſertions can agree with the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the Scripture. For, 1. if <hi>Uzziah</hi> reigned but five and twenty (or ſeven and twenty) years, after he was ſmitten with leproſie, then was <hi>Jotham</hi> his ſon born about the time when he was ſo ſmitten (for he was five and twenty years when his father died, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.32, 33.) and how could that be, ſeeing it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that <hi>Uzziah</hi> being upon this occaſion ſequeſtred from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jotham</hi> the Kings ſon was over the houſe, judging the people of the land. See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5. And for the ſecond, of <hi>Amos</hi> beginning to Prophecy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42788:47"/>
in the ſeventeenth year of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, if <hi>Uzziah</hi> began to reign in the ſeven and twentieth year of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.11. then by that acccount <hi>Amos</hi> ſhould have begun to Prophecy ten years before <hi>Uzziah</hi> began to reign, which is contrary to what is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. whereby it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that this way of accounting theſe <hi>ſixty and five years,</hi> cannot be juſtified. There is therefore another anſwer given by others to this great queſtion, which is, that this breaking of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereof the Prophet here ſpeaks, was not that when the main body of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were carried away captives by <hi>Shalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer,</hi> in the ninth year of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.6. which was indeed but two and twenty years after this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (for there were then many of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> left behind in the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who continued ſtill to be a people by themſelves, though very much weakened and broken) but that when <hi>Ezar-hadden,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> 2 King. 19.37. did ſweep away all thoſe whom his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left behind, and carried them away captives into his own Countries, placing a fuller Colony of other Nations in their room. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.2. at which time they were indeed utterly broken from being a people. Now that this was threeſcore and five years after this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> they make out thus. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for granted that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Prophecyed this about the third year of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> there were thirteen years after this of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his reign, 2 <hi>King</hi> 10.2. to which if we add the twenty and nine years of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> reign, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.2. then if the remainder of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were carried away by <hi>Ezar-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>don</hi> in the three and twentieth year of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> (as it may be probably thought, becauſe about that time the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> did invade the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and carried away <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11.) this makes up juſt <hi>threeſcore and five years.</hi> And indeed this computation of theſe years, and expoſition of this place, is by lateſt Expoſitors beſt approved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliahs ſon.]</hi> This muſt be underſtood, as the like expreſſion was in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe concerning <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Rezin;</hi> to wit, that <hi>Samaria</hi> (concerning which ſee the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.24.) was the head-city of the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſhould never come to be the Metropolis of <hi>Judea,</hi> and that <hi>Pekah</hi> was the King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> but ſhould never be the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or have power to diſpoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> as they had deſigned. Yet by ſubjoining this to that which was ſaid immediately before in the cloſe of the foregoing verſe concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it may ſeem to imply, that <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Pekah, Remaliahs</hi> ſon, ſhould be ſo far from having any dominion over <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that they both ſhould, together with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be ruined and deſtroyed, which indeed came accordingly to paſs; for within a year, or there-about, <hi>Pekah</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Hoſhea.</hi> See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.30. and in <hi>Hoſhea</hi>'s reign <hi>Samaria</hi> was taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.9, 10.</p>

It is becauſe ye are not ſtable,</hi> to wit, in the faith, or in the Covenant, whereof you make profeſſion, in that you profeſs your ſelves to be Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people. As if he had ſaid, If you believe not this promiſe concerning your deliverance from theſe two Kings that have conſpired againſt you, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſeek to ſecure your ſelves elſewhere, by ſending to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> for help
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42788:47"/>
(as it is clear <hi>Ahaz</hi> at this time did, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.7.) this is becauſe you are not ſtedfaſt and ſtable in reſting and relying upon God, as you ought to do, and ſo are over-born with theſe diſtruſtful fears. You have caſt off God, and ſo do not put confidence in his help, and this is the reaſon why you regard not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But I conceive the words are beſt tranſlated as they are in our Bibles, <hi>If ye will not believe, ſurely ye ſhall not be eſtabliſhed;</hi> that is, If you will not give credit to this meſſage which I have brought you, and rely upon this deliverance, which from God I have promiſed you, you ſhall never be ſetled in your minds againſt theſe terrors and fears, or rather you ſhall not proſper in any deſign you take in hand for the ſecuring and eſtabliſhing of your ſelves; you ſhall not be ſetled in your preſent ſtate and condition, but ſhall e're long be ruined and deſtroyed. It ſeems the Prophet perceived <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and his Nobles, and ſervants with him, ſtill to continue in great perplexity and fear, and thereupon he added theſe words, <hi>If ye will n<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Moreover the Lord ſpake again unto Ahaz, ſaying.]</hi> To wit, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> who, when he ſaw that <hi>Ahaz</hi> anſwered nothing, as not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe he had made him, and that he and thoſe that were him, were ſtill in as great an afrightment as they were, he thereupon no doubt by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial guidance of Gods Spirit, takes occaſion to add that which follows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Ask thee a ſign, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, I perceive thou believeſt not that which I have ſaid to thee, concerning the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from theſe two Kings that are combined againſt it; but that thou mayeſt know that I have ſpoken nothing without a Commiſſion from God, <hi>ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God;</hi> that is, I leave it to thy free choice for thy farther ſatisfaction, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing to be done, which thou knoweſt none but God Almighty can do, as a ſign to bear witneſs to the truth of that which I have ſpoken, and it ſhall be done for thee; <hi>ask it, either in the depth, or in the height above;</hi> that is, either on the earth beneath, or in the Heaven above. And obſervable it is, that in proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> he added thoſe words <hi>(thy God), Ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God,</hi> that is, who by external Covenant is the only God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whom thou doſt indeed profeſs to be thy God; for he did hereby covertly tax him for his Apoſtacy to his Idol-gods. But indeed that which is moſt conſiderable is, 1. The wonderful indulgence of God to this wicked wretch, in making him ſuch a proffer for the ſtrengthening of his faith, (concerning which ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) And, 2. how clearly the Prophet did hereby diſcover that he ſpake nothing to him, but by ſure and unqueſtionable warrant from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>But Ahaz ſaid, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.]</hi> Some take this as ſpoken by way of indignation; as if <hi>Ahaz</hi> had ſaid, I do not believe the promiſe which you have made me, as you pretend from God; nor will I be ſo fooliſh as to rely upon any ſuch promiſe in ſo great a danger as this is; but am reſolved to provide for my ſafety, and the ſafety of my Kingdom and people ſome other way, and therefore I will not make any trial what God will do, by asking any ſuch ſign, as you adviſe me to ask. To what end ſhould I do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42788:48"/>
reſolved not to rely on God, or any miracle that can be wrought? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is clear, that at this time he was contriving to call in the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to his help. See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.7. But we do not uſually call this making a trial whether God will work ſuch a wonder, a tempting of God; and it is hardly to be thought that <hi>Ahaz</hi> would ſo openly renounce God. Others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do better underſtand it, as a refuſal to ask any ſign, either one or other, under a pretence that he was content and ſatisfied with the promiſe which God had made, and was afraid to ſin by tempting God, (concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.16. <hi>&amp; Exod.</hi> 17.2.) whereby he did covertly alſo caſt an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the Prophet, in that he had adviſed him to do that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods expreſs command. But yet doubtleſs he did but hypocritically make this a pretence; and the true reaſon why he refuſed the ſign proffered him, was not any religious fear of offending God, but becauſe he believed not the Prophet, and was however determined to ſeek help elſewhere. Or perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not willing that God and the true Religion ſhould be honoured (to the reproach of his Idol-gods) by any ſuch miracle, if it ſhould come to paſs as the Prophet had promiſed; or elſe meerly becauſe he would to the Prophet in this his danger make a ſhew of fearing God; whereby he did only add to his ſin, ſeeking hypocritically to cover his diſobedience and ingratitude, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which was not in his heart.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And he ſaid, Hear ye now, O houſe of David, &amp;c.]</hi> See the Note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. By this Preface the Prophet rouzeth up <hi>Ahaz</hi> and all that were with him, ſeriouſly to weigh the weightineſs of that which he intended now to ſay to them. But withal by terming them the <hi>houſe of David,</hi> he did covertly upbraid them for their being ſo far degenerated as they were, from the faith and piety of him, of whoſe family they boaſted themſelves to be: <hi>Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary men? but will you weary my God alſo?</hi> that is, Is it not enough for you that you vex and diſquiet men, to wit, the people of God in general, by your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and perſecutions; or rather more particularly me and other the Prophets of God, by ſlighting what we ſay, by injuring and perſecuting us as poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible men, but that you will needs alſo vex and diſquiet God, to wit, by deſpiſing the grace proffered in the ſign tendered you, whereby he intended to glorifie himſelf (and that the more wickedly too by doing it under a pretence of piety), and ſo conſequently by diſtruſting whether God will do, or be able to do what he hath proſſered and promiſed to do? Some underſtand theſe words as only implying this aggravation of their ſin in deſpiſing the ſign tendered them by the Prophet, to wit, that the diſhonour herein caſt upon the Prophet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the diſhonour and reproach of God himſelf, whoſe ſervant he was; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.11. But I rather think that this is not ſpoken of their deſpiſing God by deſpiſing his ſervant the Prophet, but of an affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered immediately to God himſelf (above that which was offered him in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the Prophet), to wit, that they reſolved not to reſt upon Gods help, but to ſeek to ſecure themſelves by craving aid from the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> But however obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable it is, that in preſſing this, he uſeth that expreſſion of <hi>my God, Will ye weary my God alſo?</hi> for hereby he implied that he had ſpoken nothing but as Gods meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger or Miniſter, and by commiſſion from him, and that it was upon account
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42788:48"/>
of that ſpecial relation which he had to God, that he was ſo tenderly ſenſible of the great wrong they had now done to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, ſeeing you deſpiſe, or becauſe you deſpiſe and reject this great mercy and grace which God was pleaſed to tender you, of giving you whatever ſign you would ask, for the confirming of the promiſe he had made you, therefore the Lord himſelf will of his own accord, notwithſtanding this your infidelity and contempt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your will or deſire, give you a ſign (ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) and that indeed far more ſtrange, wonderful and miraculous than any you could have asked, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son;</hi> which doubtleſs was meant of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as is clearly affirmed by the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 1.22, 23. where having related how the Angel made known to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his eſpouſed Wife was conceived with child by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſhould bring forth a Son, whoſe name ſhould be Jeſus, he adds, <hi>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying, Behold a Virgin ſhall be with child, and ſhall bring forth a Son, and they ſhall call</hi> (or, <hi>his name ſhall be called) Emmanuel;</hi> which no way differs from that which is ſaid here, that he ſhould be called ſo by his Virgin-mother, <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> Or, <hi>Thou, O Virgin, ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> For the Prophets meaning was not, that this name ſhould be given unto Chriſt, either by his Mother, or any body elſe, as a name whereby he ſhould be ordinarily called, (for at his Circumciſion by the foreappointment of the Angel, <hi>his name was called Jeſus,</hi> Luk. 2.21.) but that he ſhould be, and ſhould both by his Mother and others be owned to be <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with us,</hi> Mat. 1.23. and that not only becauſe he was both God and Man, the Godhead and Manhood being in him Perſonally united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily;</hi> but alſo becauſe by him there was a perfect reconcilement made between God and us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. And indeed frequently in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is ſaid of Perſons and places, that they ſhould be called by ſuch or ſuch a name, when the meaning is not, that men in ſpeaking to them, or of them, ſhould give them that name, but only that that which was ſignified by thoſe names, ſhould be in them ſo exactly accompliſhed, that they might be in that regard moſt fitly and deſervedly called by thoſe names. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.26. ſo we find it ſaid upon this account concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> that his name ſhould be <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. and yet we do not read that he was ever ordinarily called by that name. And the like may be ſaid concerning thoſe names given to <hi>Paſhur,</hi> Jer. 20.3. and to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 48.35. and to our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. <hi>&amp; Jer.</hi> 23.6. And therefore I conceive it is not to be queſtioned but that the ſame is intended here, in ſaying that the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> namely, that he ſhould be true <hi>Immanuel, God with us.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding I would not deny what I find affirmed by many learned men, that by expreſſing this in thoſe words, that his Virgin-mother ſhould call his name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> there might be a covert intimation of that great myſtery, that becauſe he had no father upon earth, therefore it is ſaid that he ſhould be ſo called by his Virgin-mother. But now the great queſtion is, How this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42788:49"/>
conception and birth of our Saviour Chriſt, can be fairly maintained to be indeed that ſign which is here foretold by the Prophet? The <hi>Jews</hi> deny this with much confidence, but with little or no colour of truth: For, 1. whereas they ſay, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which we tranſlate a <hi>Virgin,</hi> doth properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any young Damſel, Virgin or other, married or unmarried, of this they are not able to give us any one inſtance, where the word is ſo uſed in the whole Scripture. And beſides, what an abſurdity is it to think, that the birth of any child conceived and born in an ordinary way, ſhould be here foretold by the Prophet as ſuch a ſtrange miraculous ſign? And, 2. whereas they affirm, that this Son, whoſe conception and birth is here foretold, was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (for ſo ſome of them ſay) and that of him it is ſaid that his <hi>name</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> becauſe in his days God was with them indeed in an eminent manner, when he delivered them ſo miraculouſly from the mighty army of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that had beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or elſe a Son which the Prophets wife bare him, whoſe name was indeed called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> as by way of prediction, that God would be with them to deliver them from the intended Invaſion of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Syrians;</hi> neither of theſe can be maintained with any probability of reaſon. For, 1. If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, as it is ſaid he was, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.2. then ſixteen years before that, which was in the beginning of his father <hi>Ahaz</hi> his reign, (for he reigned in all but ſixteen years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2.) he muſt needs be about nine years old; and how then could he be the Son, whoſe conception and birth was here foretold to <hi>Ahaz?</hi> And, 2. for that which they ſay that the Prophets wife had three Sons, who had all names given them by Gods appointment, as by way of Prophetical foretelling things to come, as namely, 1. <hi>Shear-jaſhab,</hi> mentioned above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And, 2. <hi>Maher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.3. And, 3. This <hi>Immanuel</hi> of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here ſpeaks; for this laſt, that he was to be conceived and born by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wife, (beſides that they have no Scripture-warrant for it, but meerly their own conjecture) can no way conſiſt with that which is ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.8. for were this <hi>Immanuel</hi> to have been of no higher deſcent, why ſhould the Prophet there call the land of <hi>Judah</hi> his land, in regard of his ſpecial intereſt in it, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over it? <hi>and the ſtretching out of his wings ſhall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</hi> And, 3. however, neither any Son of the King, or of the Prophet, can be that <hi>Immanuel</hi> that is here foretold, unleſs it can be maintained that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, both before and after his conception and birth, a pure Virgin. The moſt plauſible objection indeed that is made by the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt this great truth, that this is a Prophecy of the conception and birth of out Saviour Jeſus Chriſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is this: How that which was to come to paſs ſo many ages after, could be now given as a ſign to thoſe to whom the Prophet here ſpake, to confirm the promiſe made them of the deliverance of them, and the City <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> from the ſurpriſal of thoſe two potent Kings that were coming againſt them, which the words indeed do plainly import? But to this it may be juſtly anſwered, 1. That ſtrange and wonderful things that are long after to come to paſs, may be foretold as ſigns for the confirming of ſome preſent promiſe given, becauſe the confident prediction of ſuch things may be of force to raiſe mens minds to the more hopeful expectation of that which is at preſent promiſed. Two

notable inſtances we have of this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.29. concerning which ſee the Notes there. It is indeed no more than as if he had ſaid, You que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether God can effect that deliverance which I have promiſed you; but I will tell you therefore of a greater wonder that God will certainly do, and that is <hi>a Virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a Son,</hi> without the knowledg or help of man, by whom there ſhall be a reconciliation made betwixt God and men. 2. That the prediction of the miraculous conception and birth of the Lord Chriſt, their promiſed Meſſiah, was the more proper and ſeaſonable at this time, becauſe the certainty of the accompliſhment of this did imply the unqueſtionable preſervation of <hi>Davids</hi> Royal family, (from whence this Son of the Virgin was to ſpring), which was the thing that <hi>Ahaz</hi> now refuſed to believe. If <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> or any other enemies, ſhould be able to cut off the family of <hi>David,</hi> what would then become of the promiſe of the Meſſiah, that was to deſcend from that Royal ſtem? By giving him therefore this ſign of the ſupernatural conception and birth of their promiſed Meſſiah, the ſeed of the woman, the Prophet did not only tell him that which was an unqueſtionable ground whereon he might rely, againſt all fear of the ruin of <hi>Davids</hi> family; but he did alſo diſcover the root of his diſtruſtful fears, namely, that he did not indeed believe that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promiſe concerning the Meſſiah, nor that Covenant of Grace which God had made with his people, which was eſtabliſhed thereon, and that therefore it was no wonder though he were continually ſhaken with ſuch unbelieving fears. 3. That it is uſual with the Prophets upon this ground, when they are ſpeaking of temporal deliverances and mercies promiſed to Gods people, to paſs on a ſudden, as by a Prophetick rapture, to make mention of the Meſſiah, <hi>in whom all the promiſes of God are yea and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. who is therefore the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the hope and conſolation of Gods people, in regard of any mercy that God hath promiſed them. And, 4. that together with this prediction of the wonder of the conception and birth of their promiſed Meſſiah, there ſeems to be another ſign joined, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. (concerning which ſee the Note there), both ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give them aſſurance, that God would be with his people, in delivering them from thoſe two Kings that were coming againſt them, as he had before promiſed them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Butter and honey ſhall he eat, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, this <hi>Immanuel</hi> before mentioned, the Son of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhall be fed with butter and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſuch meats as young children do affect, and wherewith in this Country, by reaſon of their plenty, they are uſually much fed. <hi>That he may know to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good;</hi> that is, that he may grow up till he comes to thoſe years of diſcretion, that he will be able to diſcern between good and evil; to wit, that which is naturally or morally good and evil, and ſo to chuſe that which is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and commendable, and reject that which is hurtful and blame-worthy; which yet muſt be reſtrained to that weaker meaſure of knowledg and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is uſually found in little children, when firſt the exerciſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding begins to diſcover it ſelf in them, as we ſee where the ſame phraſe is uſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.39. <hi>Your children which in that day had no knowledg between good and evil, they ſhall go in thither.</hi> So that the drift of this verſe is clearly to imply, that the Lord Chriſt, the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould be true and very
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42788:50"/>
man, nouriſhed and brought up from his infancy as other children are; and that he ſhould be ſubject to the ſame infirmities and weakneſs both of body and mind, that other children are ſubject to; and ſhould therefore grow up in ſtrength and underſtanding by little and little, as other children do, as it is expreſly ſaid that Chriſt did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. <hi>And Jeſus increaſed in wiſdom and ſtature, and in favour both with God and man.</hi> I know there are ſeveral learned men that underſtand this verſe, not of the Son of the Virgin mentioned in the foregoing verſe, but of the Prophets Son <hi>Shear-jaſhab,</hi> mentioned before <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and ſo they conceive this is added to confirm the foregoing Prophecy, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. concerning the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, from the combined forces of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> that were joining together againſt them; as if the Prophet had ſaid, Whereas theſe two Kings have reſolved to beſiege and to take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo far ſhall they be from effecting what they have deſigned, that this my child <hi>Shear-jaſhab</hi> (whom by Gods command I have brought along with me as a ſign to aſſure you of the mercy promiſed, ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) ſhall be, notwithſtanding this their ſiege, fed and nouriſhed, and brought up as ſafely and tenderly as other young children uſe to be in times of greateſt peace and plenty. But the words, <hi>Butter and honey ſhall he eat, &amp;c.</hi> do ſo plainly refer to that which went before, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel,</hi> that I cannot ſee how it can, without manifeſt wreſting the words, be underſtood of any other than that <hi>Immanuel</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, &amp;c.]</hi> See the foregoing Note, <hi>The land that thou abhorreſt,</hi> that is, the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> againſt which thou beareſt ſuch a deadly enmity for the miſchief they have done thee, and the great evil which they are now conſpiring to bring upon thee (or it may be meant both of the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the land of <hi>Syria,</hi> collectively taken) <hi>ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings;</hi> that is, it ſhall be bereaved of both her Kings, to wit, of <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were now joined in a ſtrict Confederacy againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> both of them being cut off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; ſo that the meaning is, that theſe Kings ſhould be ſo far from effecting what they had deſigned, to wit, the ſurpriſal of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the cutting off the Royal family of <hi>David,</hi> that they themſelves ſhould be each of them ſlain and deſtroyed; concerning which ſee the foregoing Notes, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 7, 8, 9. But now the great queſtion again is, What child is here meant, concerning which it is ſaid, <hi>Before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings?</hi> Many learned men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not only the 14. <hi>v.</hi> but the 15. alſo, <hi>Butter and honey ſhall he eat, &amp;c.</hi> of the Lord Chriſt, the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> do yet underſtand this of any new-born child; as if the Prophet had ſaid, Before the child that is now newly born, or is ſhortly to be born, ſhall grow up to years of diſcretion, both theſe Kings that have now combined againſt thee, ſhall be deſtroyed. Now to prove that theſe words <hi>(the child)</hi> may be underſtood indefinitely of any child, they alledg another place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5. where the Prophet uſeth the like indefinite expreſſion, <hi>The child ſhall be have himſelf proudly againſt the ancient.</hi> And becauſe it may juſtly ſeem ſtrange that the Prophet having ſpoken in the foregoing verſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth, and education of Chriſt; and of the laſt, with the very words
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42788:50"/>
here uſed, that he ſhould eat butter and honey, <hi>that he may know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good,</hi> and yet ſhould now preſently ſpeak of any child in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, now newly born, or ſhortly to be born, and that under the ſame expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings.</hi> To this they anſwer, that having in the foregoing verſes grounded the hope of their promiſed deliverance from <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> upon a promiſe of the ſupernatural conception, and birth, and education of their Meſſiah, that was to ſpring from that Royal family of <hi>David,</hi> which theſe Kings ſought to deſtroy, he now ſheweth the time when they ſhould be delivered, to wit, very ſhortly, before the child now newly born ſhould grow up to have any uſe of his reaſon and underſtanding. Again others, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt of our late and beſt Expoſitors underſtand this not of any child in general, but of ſome particular child there preſent, or whoſe mother was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and the moſt pitch upon <hi>Shear-jaſhab,</hi> mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And ſo they ſay, that whereas in the foregoing verſes the Prophet had ſpoken of the conception and birth of the Lord Chriſt the Meſſiah, here now he adds that ſign which was before tendered to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> to aſſure them of their preſent delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Invaſion of <hi>Rezin</hi> or <hi>Pekah.</hi> Becauſe (ſay they) <hi>Ahaz</hi> might think that they might haply be all deſtroyed before the birth of this <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which was now given them as a ſign of their approaching deliverance. To prevent this objection of his, the Prophet aſſures him that they ſhould be ſo far from preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the birth of this their Meſſiah, the Saviour of his Church, long after to be bore, by cutting off the houſe and family of <hi>David,</hi> the ſtock from whence he was to ſpring, that before the child that was now newly born (ſuppoſe <hi>Shear-ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhab,</hi> that was there before him, or any other), ſhould attain to any years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, both theſe Kings that were now combined to cut off the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed; to wit, within three or four years. Which indeed came to paſs accordingly; for <hi>Rezin</hi> was ſlain by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that came to help <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9. and <hi>Pekah</hi> was ſlain not long after by <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> as is evident, becauſe <hi>Pekah</hi> began his reign the two and fiftieth, the laſt year of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> or <hi>Azariah,</hi> and reigned but twenty years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.27. and conſidering that ſixteen of theſe twenty years he reigned together with <hi>Jotham</hi> the Son of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> it muſt needs be that he was ſlain about the fourth year of <hi>Ahaz</hi> the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</hi> So that if <hi>Shear-jaſhab</hi> were at this time one or two years old, it muſt needs be that <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> were ſlain before he attained any great ability of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning between good and evil. And the ſame may be ſaid of any other new-born child, or ſhortly to be born, that ſhould be here particularly intended.</p>
               <p>But indeed, 1. Becauſe it may well be thought, that if the Prophet had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this of <hi>Shear-jaſhab,</hi> or any other particular child, he would have ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (this) child ſhall know to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, 2ly, becauſe the words do ſo clearly ſeem to have reſpect to that child already ſpoken of in the two foregoing verſes, and more eſpecially to that <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Butter and honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good,</hi> I cannot but think that this alſo is to be underſtood of the Lord Chriſt, the Son of the Virgin, as well as the two foregoing verſes. The great objection againſt this is, how the Prophet could intend this to comfort <hi>Ahaz</hi> againſt his fears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42788:51"/>
                  <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> if his meaning had been, that before Chriſt, that was to be conceived and born ſo many hundred years after, ſhould be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between good and evil, the land which he abhorred ſhould be forſaken of both her Kings. But to this three anſwers are given: firſt, (which indeed ſeems to me of all moſt improbable) that the Prophet doth not ſpeak this of the death of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> but of the death of one <hi>Obodas,</hi> King of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and of <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was not long after the birth of Chriſt. Secondly, that the drift of the Prophet is not to ſhew how ſuddenly, but how certainly <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed. As fully reſolved as they were to deſtroy the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> from whence the promiſed Meſſiah, the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> was to ſpring, before this his miraculous conception, and birth, and education, both theſe Kings ſhould be deſtroyed. And thirdly, That the meaning is only this, that within as ſhort a ſpace of time as ſhould be between the birth of this <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> the child Jeſus, and his being grown up to the uſual years of diſcretion, both theſe Kings that were now preparing to make war againſt <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſhould be cut off and deſtroyed. This I find mentioned by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations; and it ſeems to me the moſt ſatisfying anſwer.</p>

army, and ſhould ſeize upon and poſſeſs themſelves of all places, high and low, fruitful and barren, eating up and conſuming all they could meet with in every corner of the land, yea in the moſt deſolate and uninhabited places; by reaſon whereof too, there would be no place of ſhelter for the inhabitants; though they ſhould fly to the caves and moſt deſolate vallies to hide themſelves, it would be in vain; for every where they ſhould find the enemy ready to ſurprize them. Some Expoſitors I know there are, that by <hi>the deſolate vallies</hi> underſtand the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the vallies, which the inhabitants had out of fear forſaken; and by <hi>the holes of the rocks,</hi> the Cities built on the rocky mountains; and by <hi>thorns and buſhes,</hi> the villages, wherein the Country-people dwelt.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42788:52"/>
But methinks it is moſt clear that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are here compared to a <hi>razor that is hired,</hi> either with reſpect to the Lords drawing them on to the invaſion of that wealthy Kingdom with the hope of the great ſpoil they ſhould get there, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where it is ſaid that God gave the ſpoil of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> as his hire for the great ſervice he had done for God in deſtroying <hi>Tyrus, Ezek.</hi> 29.18, 19. or elſe ſimply with reſpect to that rich preſent, or great ſum of money where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Ahaz</hi> hired <hi>Tiglath-pileſer</hi> to come into his aid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.7, 8. which ſeems the more probable, becauſe then the words imply a ſharp intimation of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his folly, in that the land it is ſaid ſhould be thus ſhaven with a razor, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had hired. And if this be ſo, obſervable it is too, that the great deſolation that is here threatned muſt take in all the waſte that was made by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in that land by <hi>Tiglath-pileſer</hi> and others, as is noted before, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and not be limited only to that utter deſtruction, which was at laſt brought upon them by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> though indeed the utter deſolation here threatned was never conſummated till then, when they were indeed ſhaven from top to toe; whence it is ſaid, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.10. <hi>The adverſary hath ſpread out his hand upon all her pleaſant things.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.16. <hi>They have devoured the land and all that is in it.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.6. <hi>All ſhall be carried to Babylon, nothing ſhall be left.</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42788:53"/>
ſole proviſion wherewith that poor remainder of people that are left in the land ſhould ſuſtain themſelves, and that becauſe the land ſhall be ſo waſted that fleſh and corn, and wine and oyl, which were formerly in great plenty amongſt them, ſhould not be then to be had; a juſt puniſhment of their former luxury. Yea, and becauſe it is in the Original, <hi>every one that is left in the midſt of the land;</hi> ſome would have this to imply, that this ſcarcity and penury ſhould be in the beſt and moſt fruitful parts of the land, becauſe all ſhould lye waſte and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late there, as well as in the barren mountains.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that every place, &amp;c.]</hi> In theſe words we have a farther deſcription how waſte and deſolate the land ſhould lye, and ſo alſo a reaſon why every one left in the land ſhould live upon ſuch poor Country-fare, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, namely, becauſe the richeſt and moſt pleaſant places in the land ſhould lye deſolate and unfrequented, wholly overgrown with briers and thorns, <hi>every place ſhall be where there were a thouſand vines at a thouſand ſilverlings, it ſhall be even for briers and thorns;</hi> that is, thoſe places which were formerly eſteemed the moſt fruitful and delightful places in the land, where they had rich corn-grounds, or rather gardens and olive-yards, and vineyards, ſhall then lye like ſo many thickets of briers and thorns for want of Husbandmen to till, and plant, and dreſs them. He inſtanceth therefore in vineyards only, becauſe therein they chiefly delighted; as if he had ſaid, Thoſe places (for inſtance) where they had formerly the goodlieſt and moſt precious vineyards, vineyards planted with the rareſt and choiceſt vines, (a thouſand ſuch vines being worth a thouſand ſilverlings or pieces of ſilver; that is, as moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters take it, a thouſand ſhekels. See the Note, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.11.) ſhall then become very forreſts and deſerts. And thus thoſe ſpiritual briers and thorns which were found in the people, Gods vineyard (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6.) were puniſhed with that horrid deſolation, whereto their Country was expoſed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>With arrows and with bows ſhall men come thither, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, If the inhabitants have any occaſion to go into thoſe places where formerly they had ſuch rich vineyards, being now become like ſo many woods and thickets, they muſt go armed with bow and arrows, to wit, to defend themſelves from robbers and wild beaſts, that uſe to lye lurking in ſuch places. And indeed the over-running of the land with wild beaſts, when it ſhould be laid deſolate, is a judgment wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> did long before threaten this people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.22. Some, I know, underſtand this of mens going thither with bow and arrows to hunt thoſe wild beaſts, that uſe for covert to haunt ſuch places. But in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the ſad condition of the land, it ſeems not ſo probable that ſuch a paſſage concerning hunting, which is an exerciſe of pleaſure, ſhould be inſerted; the drift of adding this paſſage is clearly, I conceive, to ſet forth how many years the land ſhould lye thus deſolate, even till the briers in ſuch places were grown up to ſuch a height, that they ſhould become like ſo many woods and forreſts for wild beaſts to lurk in; which accordingly came to paſs in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, by reaſon of the ſmall number of the inhabitants that were left in the land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe all the land ſhall become briers and thorns.]</hi> And ſo even their Vineyards, and other the choiceſt and moſt pleaſant places in the land, ſhall lye deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42788:53"/>
and be turned into very wilderneſſes; the Lord hereby depriving them of the plenty which they had formerly abuſed to drunkenneſs and luxury.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And on all hills that ſhall be digged with the mattock, there ſhall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns, &amp;c.]</hi> This place is ſeveral ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Interpreters. But there are only two Expoſitions that ſeem to me to have any great probability in them, if we read the words, as they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our Tranſlation. The firſt is, that on all thoſe hilly places that ſhould be curiouſly kept and digged for Vineyards, or Orchards and Gardens, by the richer ſort, either for their profit or pleaſure, and fenced about with hedges of thorns and briers, that ſo they might be ſecured from the breaking in and biting of cattel, thoſe thorny fences ſhould be on every ſide ſo trodden and broken down, and taken away, that there ſhould be no fear of them to keep beaſts from entring in. <hi>But it ſhall be for the ſending forth of oxen, and for the treading of leſſer cattel;</hi> that is, theſe curious grounds being thus laid open, there ſhall be free entrance for all kind of cattel, as well great as ſmall, to feed and graze there at pleaſure. And then the ſecond is, (which to me ſeems far the moſt probable) that whereas the lower grounds ſhould be over-grown with briers and thorns, as thick and as high as ſo many woods and forreſts, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſes; on the contrary, upon the hills and mountains, that formerly uſed to lye deſolate, wholly over-grown with briers and thorns, there ſhould then be no fear of briers and thorns, and that becauſe thoſe inhabitants that were left in the land ſhould fly to theſe hills and mountains for refuge, as being ſteep and high, and inacceſſible places (according to that <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains</hi>), and ſo being there, ſhould clear thoſe places of briers and thorns by ſtubbing them up with the mattock, and turn them into Paſture-ground for their cattel to feed in; and ſo then the very treading of the cattel would prevent the fear of the growing up of thoſe thorns and briers any more.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>MOreover the Lord ſaid unto me, &amp;c.]</hi> Becauſe the Prophecy in the foregoing Chapter concerning the utter ſubverſion of the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> might ſeem incredible, and was, as it is likely, but little regarded; the Lord appeared again to the Prophet, and gave him this Prophecy in charge, contained in the five following Chapters, in the beginning whereof the ſame thing, though in other words, and by other ways, is again foretold; and that too in a more publick way; that which was before more privately made known to <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his Courtiers, being here appointed to be written by the Prophet <hi>in a great roul,</hi> and that no doubt purpoſely that it might be affixed on ſome Gate of the Temple, or ſet up in ſome other publick place, that ſo it might be publiſhed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42788:54"/>
abroad, and expoſed to every mans view. And indeed obſervable it is, that the particular direction here given for the ſetting forth of this Prophecy thus to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, is an argument that the Prophets were not wont to fix all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies on the Temple-gate, as ſome have thought, (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) but only when this was expreſly enjoined them. <hi>Take thee a great roul, and write in it with a mans pen concerning Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz;</hi> which is the very name that the Prophet was afterwards enjoined to give to his new-born Son, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. which is, being interpreted, as it is rendered in the Margent of our Bibles, <hi>In making ſpeed to the ſpoil, he haſteneth the prey;</hi> or, <hi>Make ſpeed to the ſpoil, haſten the prey;</hi> and the drift of it was queſtionleſs to ſignifie, that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould by the ſecret all-ruling Providence of God be ſpeedily called into the ſpoil of the two Kingdoms <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> that were now combined together againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> that ſo the faithful might hereby be comforted in their preſent fears, and might be aſſured, that though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was hired by <hi>Ahaz,</hi> yet it was not without the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſel and providence of God that it was ſo done. Some think that this name of his Son <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> was all that the Prophet was appointed to write in the roul; and that this Prophecy concerning the deſtruction that was coming upon the <hi>Syrians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was purpoſely expreſſed in ſo few words, that every one that read it, might the more eaſily remember it, and carry it home with them, and that ſo it might be frequent in the months of men, as a a token given them from God of the ruin that ſhould ſuddenly come upon their great enemies, that were making ſuch mighty preparation againſt them. But why then ſhould there be ſo great a roul provided to write it in? It was, ſay they, becauſe theſe words were to be written in it with great Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that every one that ſhould caſt their eyes upon it might read it, yea though they ſtood afar off; according to a like command given, <hi>Habbak.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Write the Viſion, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</hi> But then others hold, that the Prophet was enjoined to take <hi>a great roul;</hi> becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was great that was to be written in it, all (ſay ſome) that is expreſſed in the four firſt verſes of this Chapter, tending to ſhew what was ſignified by this ſtrange name that was to be impoſed on the Prophets Son; yea, the whole fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prophecy, ſay others; which may be juſtly thought the more probable, both becauſe that which was to be written in the roul is ſaid to be, not <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> but <hi>concerning Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz;</hi> and becauſe it cannot well be thought that the people when they come to read the writing, would have underſtood the meaning of it, if the whole Prophecy had not been ingroſſed in it. And for the ſame end is that added, that the Prophet was to write that which was to be written in this roul <hi>with a mans pen;</hi> that is, with ſuch a pen, and with ſuch letters as were ordinarily uſed by men in writing; not with any ſtrange unuſual characters, ſuch as ſecret myſteries were ſometimes expreſſed with, which none but Gods Prophets could read, (as we ſee in that writing which <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſaw written on the wall, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.7, 8.) but ſuch plain familiar letters as were commonly uſed by all ſorts of men in writing, that ſo the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt amongſt the people might eaſily read it. Very many I know there are that do quite otherwiſe underſtand this whole Prophecy; for they conceive that this <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> was a Prophetick name given to Chriſt, to ſignifie that he

But I find nothing here in the Prophet, that ſhould induce me to think that any ſuch myſtery was hereby intended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And I took unto me faithful witneſſes to record, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, credible witneſſes, againſt whoſe teſtimony no exception could be juſtly taken, <hi>Uriah the Prieſt,</hi> the ſame no doubt that is mentioned 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.10. in the ſtory of <hi>Ahaz; And Zachariah the ſon of Jeberichiah,</hi> the ſame, as is moſt probably thought, that is in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.2. ſaid to have been the father of <hi>Abi,</hi> or <hi>Abijah,</hi> the wife of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and mother of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and therefore a man no doubt of great note in the State. Indeed we read in the Sacred ſtory of ſeveral others that were called by this name: As, 1. <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehojada</hi> the Prieſt, who was ſlain by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the days of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20, 21. And, 2. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> that was a Prophet in the days of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.5. And, 3. <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Barachiah,</hi> who Prophecyed in the days of <hi>Darius.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.1. But neither of theſe lived in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when this was done. And though there was indeed a Levite of that name in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.13. who therefore might alſo be living at this time; yet becauſe that <hi>Zechariah</hi> mentioned 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.2. was a man of far greater eminency, as being the father in law of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the grandfather of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by the mother ſide, it is far more probable that it was he that was taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Urijah</hi> the high Prieſt to be the Prophets Witneſſes, for by this means he had two Witneſſes of greateſt note, the one in the Eccleſiaſtical, the other in the Civil State. But what was it that theſe were to witneſs? I anſwer, only that which in the foregoing verſe it is ſaid God had enjoined the Prophet to do, as the order of the words do clearly import. They were to witneſs that the Prophet had according to Gods commandment taken a great roul, and had written in it <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> and had ſet it up, either on the Temple-gate, or in ſome other publick place, that ſo it might be expoſed to the view and reading of all the people; (and it may well be, which ſome think, that they did alſo ſubſcribe the roul as witneſſes hereto); and that to this end, that when that which by this writing God did foretel concerning utter ſubverſion of the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> did accordingly come to paſs, it might be certainly known by the teſtimony of theſe men, that God had before-hand foretold that it ſhould ſo be; which might alſo render them the more fearful of thoſe other judgments againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> which the Prophet had likewiſe foretold at the ſame time. I know that very many add too, that they were to witneſs the Prophets impoſing of this name upon his child, which is related in the following verſe. But it is clear, I conceive, that they were called only to witneſs that which God had enjoined the Prophet to do in the foregoing verſe. And indeed the abſurdity that ſeemed to follow upon making that a part of their teſtimony which is added <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>And I went unto the Propheteſs, and ſhe conceived, &amp;c.</hi> was the only cauſe why ſome have conceited that all this which is here related, was only ſeen in a Viſion by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, of which otherwiſe there is not the leaſt ground in the Tezt. As for that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42788:55"/>
ſcruple which ſome have raiſed, how <hi>Uriah</hi> could be here termed a <hi>faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> who carried himſelf ſo unfaithfully in his place, when he complied with King <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſo far, as to build him an Idolatrous altar after the faſhion of an altar which he had ſeen at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> 2 King. 16.11. To this it may be juſtly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, 1. That <hi>Uriah</hi> had not yet diſcovered his baſe hypocriſie, as in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he did afterwards, but was haply of great eſteem at preſent amongſt the people. And, 2. that men may be looked upon as <hi>faithful witneſſes,</hi> that are not the faithful ſervants of God. In regard that he was at that time the high Prieſt, he muſt needs be looked upon as a moſt credible witneſs; and in regard too of his intereſt in <hi>Ahaz,</hi> none could be judged fitter for this ſervice.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And I went unto the Propheteſs, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, my wife, the ſame no doubt by whom he had before that former Son that was called <hi>Shear-jaſhub, Chap.</hi> 7.3. Who is called the <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> becauſe ſhe was the wife of a Prophet, as with us a Dukes wife is called a Dutcheſs, and a Count or Earls wife is called a Counteſs, and ſo it is with many others. For methinks it is very hard to think that which ſome others ſay, that he calls her <hi>the Propheteſs,</hi> becauſe the bringing forth of the child, to whom God had appointed ſuch a Prophetical name, was a kind of Prophecying. It is in the <hi>Hebrew, And I approached unto the Propheteſs,</hi> whereby he modeſtly expreſſeth, after the manner of the Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.23, 30. that he lay carnally with her, and thereupon it follows, <hi>and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and bear a Son.</hi> But however clear it is, that if this which is here related concerning the birth of this Son of the Prophet, was preſently after the writing of the forementioned Prophetical roul; then his going in to the Propheteſs, and her conception thereupon, was long before, and ſo ſhould rather have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>And I had gone in to the Propheteſs, and ſhe conceived;</hi> and on the other ſide if this his going in to the Propheteſs was after the writing of this roul, then it was well nigh a twelvemonth after e're this his Son was born, and that God gave him that following command concerning his name, <hi>Then ſaid the Lord to me, call his name Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz.</hi> And therefore I queſtion not but that this was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent paſſage from that related in the two foregoing verſes; and that ſome time after the ſetting up of this roul, upon the birth of this his Son, he was enjoined to call him by that myſterious name, which was written in the roul, and that to confirm that foregoing Prophecy, and that this name of his child might be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual memorial of that Prophecy, written in the forementioned roul concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Syrians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

And it may be read too, as it is in the Margent of our Bibles, <hi>He that is before the King of Aſſyria,</hi> that is, his Officers and Miniſters, or his Captains and Commanders, <hi>ſhall take away the riches of Damaſcus, and the ſpoil of Samaria.</hi> But however it is clear, I conceive, that the accompliſhment of this was when, in or about the fourth year of <hi>Ahaz, Tiglath-pileſer</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> took <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> and ſlew <hi>Rezin</hi> their King, and carried away the people into captivity, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9. at which time he made great havock alſo in the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. though he did not take and deſtroy <hi>Samaria,</hi> as he did <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> (for that was done ſometime after by <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> in the days of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.6.) and this ſome conceive to be the reaſon, why it is ſaid here that <hi>the riches of Damaſcus</hi> ſhould be taken away by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and that he ſhould only take ſome ſpoil in <hi>Samaria.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay, A confederacy, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, Let not the faithful in the land talk as men affrighted, as the generality of the people do, ſaying, Oh, there's a confederacy, there's a confederacy of the two mighty Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> againſt us; and therefore we ſhall be utterly ruined, we ſhall never be able to ſtand before them; for that this, ſay they, is intended here, we may ſee by that which is added by way of explaining this, <hi>neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid;</hi> that is, fear not that which are they afraid of. But according to our Tranſlation, I conceive it muſt be underſtood of making a confederacy with the <hi>Aſſyrians, Say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay, a confederacy;</hi> that is, Do not thou ſay, nor let not the faithful in the land ſay, as this people do, Oh! we muſt make a confederacy with the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or elſe we ſhall never be able to withſtand theſe two Kings that are coming againſt us. Whenever this people are in any danger of enemies, they are ſtill talking of making a league with ſome potent State or other, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or ſome other Nation, by whoſe aid they may hope to ſecure themſelves; and ſo it is now, there is nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be heard amongſt them but about a confederacy with the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> that's the only way they can take to preſerve their Country. But do not ye ſo much as by a word of your mouths join with them herein. <hi>Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid;</hi> that is, fear not your enemies with ſuch an unbelieving, exceſſive fear; as they do; be not affrighted and diſmayed as men that have no hope nor confidence in God. Thus the words muſt be underſtood here ſubjectively; of the fear which was in <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his people; though indeed in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14.

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And he ſhall be for a Sanctuary, &amp;c.]</hi> As if he had ſaid, The holy God will be as a Sanctuary, a ſacred and inviolable place of refuge to thoſe holy and faithful ones that do ſanctifie him, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe; we find the ſame expreſſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16. <hi>I will be to them as a little Sanctuary in the countries where they ſhall come.</hi> And in both places there ſeems to be an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the words to the cuſtom of mens flying for ſhelter to the Tabernacle or Temple, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5. <hi>But for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to both the houſes of Iſrael,</hi> that is, to the reſt of the wicked and ungodly ones, even to the whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> both in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that refuſe to be ruled by him, and to rely upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Lord will be as a ſtone lying in the way, at which men ſtumble, or as a rock againſt which if a man or ſhip caſts violently, it will bruiſe and break them; that is, he will be an occaſion of their ruin, in that they ſhall ſtumble and take offence at his word, not believing what he ſaid, and ſo ſhall bring deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon themſelves. And to the ſame purpoſe are the following words add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>For a gin and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem;</hi> to wit, to ſhew that his word would be but as a ſnare to intangle them to their utter perdition; only it is withal obſerved, that theſe words, <hi>to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted purpoſely to imply, either, 1. That it was not the Royal ſeat, or Gods Sanctuary then, that ſhould ſecure them, but that they alſo ſhould ſuffer with the reſt. Or, 2. that God in his word ſhould be an occaſion of ruin, not only to the meaner ſort of people, but alſo to the chief amongſt them, even to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Prieſts at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now the main drift of all this was, to encourage the faithful not to be carried away with the ſtream of the people, that would not believe nor obey Gods Word, becauſe the Lord would be a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to thoſe that did believe and obey, but <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence</hi> to the reſt. But withal moſt obſervable it is, that in many places of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this is applied to Chriſt the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> mentioned before <hi>ver.</hi> 8. as in <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11. <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. where it is ſaid of the unbelieving <hi>Jews, They ſtumbled at that ſtumbling-ſtone, as it is written, Behold I lay in Sion a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtone and rock of offence.</hi> And, 1 Pet. 2.7, 8. <hi>Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which be diſobedient, the ſtone which the builders diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſame is made the head of the corner; and a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which ſtumble at the word.</hi> See alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.42. And the ground of this is, becauſe Chriſt, and ſo God in him, was to thoſe that believed in him, a foundation-ſtone, a rock of Salvation (concerning which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22.) but to others, who through their blindneſs and madneſs took offence at the meanneſs of his outward condition, and the Doctrine of life and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42788:58"/>
ſalvation, which he taught them, he became <hi>a ſtumbling-ſtone and a rock of offence,</hi> that is, an occaſion of their ruin and perdition; and thus he was <hi>the ſavour of death unto death</hi> to ſome, <hi>but the ſavour of life unto life</hi> to others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. and was <hi>ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.34. ſee alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Bind up the Teſtimony, &amp;c.]</hi> This is a part of that charge, which (as is ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.) was given by God particularly to the Prophet by way of informing him what he ſhould do, <hi>Bind up the Teſtimony, ſeal the Law among my diſciples.</hi> By <hi>the teſtimony</hi> may be meant, 1. The Law or Word of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which is often ſo called in Scripture. See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.16. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 78.5. and that becauſe the Lord hath therein made known his will to his people, and by a ſolemn and ſevere ſanction had atteſted thereto. Or, 2. the great roul which the Prophet was commanded to write, mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this Chapter, and that becauſe there was therein a Teſtimony written concerning the defence of this people, and the ruin of their enemies that were combined againſt them. Or, 3. The whole Word of God which he had now delivered to them, both in the roul which he had written and ſet up for the people to read, and in that Prophecy which he had now ſpoken to them in the name of the Lord; the Doctrine which he had now taught them, and wherein he had teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what the Lords will was that the faithful ſhould do, namely that they ſhould not walk in the way of that incredulous people. Yea, herein alſo may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded what he fore-prophecyed concerning the Meſſiah, the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that myſtery which was teſtified afore by the Prophets, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2. And ſo likewiſe the ſame may be meant by <hi>the Law,</hi> to wit, either the Word of God in general, or elſe that word or meſſage he had now delivered to them, to which they were bound to yield obedience, as to a command or Law given them from God. But now what is meant by binding up the Teſtimony and ſealing up the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods diſciples? I anſwer, that this is diverſly expounded by Expoſitors; for, 1. ſome conceive that the Prophet was hereby charged to fold and bind up that roul again, mentioned before <hi>ver.</hi> 1. that the promiſe therein contained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their approaching deliverance, might not be any longer expoſed to the neglect, and ſcorn, and deriſion of an incredulous people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that withal he ſhould ſtill preach and preſs the truth therein contained upon the faithful his followers, that were capable of underſtanding ſuch myſteries, and ready to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them; and that he ſhould more and more aſſure them of the certainty of it, that it might be eſteemed as a ſealed truth amongſt them, and an eſtabliſhed Law, according to the direction whereof they were to order themſelves. 2ly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, underſtanding it of the whole Word of God which he had now delivered them, take it to be an information given to the Prophet concerning the ſucceſs his words ſhould find amongſt the people, to wit, that his Diſciples only that were enlightened and taught by him, ſhould underſtand and embrace them, as matter of authentick truth, having Gods ſeal ſtamped on it; but that unto the reſt of the people they ſhould be as a Book that is cloſed and ſealed up; that is, they ſhould be hidden from them, ſo that they ſhould not underſtand them; and ſo indeed we find the ſame expreſſion uſed afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.11, 12. And thus theſe words, <hi>bind up and ſeal,</hi> are underſtood to imply both the hiding of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42788:59"/>
this Prophecy from the incredulous people, and the keeping and preſerving it charily for the uſe of the faithful; and this ſome conceive is principally meant of the myſteries therein revealed, in part concerning the Meſſiah, which were to be reſerved as a hidden ſecret til the days of the Goſpel. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>&amp; Rev.</hi> 5.1. And, 3ly, therefore I conceive the main intent of theſe words was to make known to the Prophet that it would be in vain to preſs his Doctrine upon an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate incredulous people, but yet that he ſhould not be diſcouraged herewith, becauſe though it were deſpiſed by the generality of the people, yet there were ſome few that ſhould believe and embrace it, whom he calls <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as the Chriſtians were at firſt called, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, ſeeing God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me not to walk in the way of this people, not to be tranſported with their fears, (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) and hath promiſed to be a Sanctuary and rock of refuge to them that ſanctifie his name and truſt in him, (<hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14.) I will quietly and conſtantly wait upon the Lord for that help and deliverance which he hath promiſed us; let both King and people look, if they will, after the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> for help, I will conſtantly wait upon God, and expect deliverance only from him, notwithſtanding the Lord doth indeed ſhew himſelf to be highly diſpleaſed with his people for their wickedneſs, both by the judgments he hath already brought upon them, and thoſe he hath now farther threatned. And thus he encourageth the people by his example to truſt in God, and to wait upon him for deliverance. Or elſe thus; ſeeing God hath revealed this to me, that my words ſhall be hidden from the generality of this rebellious people, and ſome few only ſhall believe and embrace it, I will go on in my work, quietly waiting upon him for that ſucceſs which he is pleaſed to give to my labours, and patiently ſubmitting to his good will and pleaſure, even when he hideth his face in anger, and doth puniſh their obſtinacy by withdrawing his grace and ſpirit from them, and ſo cauſeth his word to be as it were bound and ſealed up from them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſigns, and for wonders in Iſrael, &amp;c.]</hi> Becauſe theſe words, <hi>Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me,</hi> are by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. applyed to Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many learned Expoſitors hold, that they are not the words of the Prophet, ſpeaking of himſelf and his Diſciples, or followers; but the very words of Chriſt, ſpeaking to the Prophet, and that to comfort him againſt the hatred of the wicked, and the ſcorn and contempt which they caſt upon him, by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who taking upon him in our nature the work of a Prophet, was to be uſed as ſcornfully and contemptuouſly himſelf; as if it had been ſaid, Behold I (who am the Son of God, and the great Prophet of the Church) and my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that ſhall through the grace of God embrace my Doctrine, the children which God ſhall give me (according to that <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed</hi>), ſhall be eſteemed as monſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided and reproached amongſt Gods people; and therefore it is no wonder though they uſe thee ſo. <hi>The diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord, Mat.</hi> 10.24. But to make theſe not to be the words of the Prophet, but of Chriſt only, is methinks very harſh, and overthrows the whole paſſage of the Context.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42788:59"/>
Nor is it neceſſary they ſhould be ſo taken, becauſe the Apoſtle applies them to Chriſt; nothing being more uſual in the New Teſtament than to apply many paſſages to Chriſt, that in the Old Teſtament were ſpoken of others that were Types of Chriſt, as we may ſee (for inſtance) in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. for which ſee the Note there. Others therefore do better, I conceive, take them to be the Prophets own words; but withal they differ in their opinion concerning the meaning of them. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some underſtand this of the Prophets children, born to him by his lawful wife, to wit, <hi>Shear-jaſhub,</hi> and <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> mentioned before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.3. and accordingly they conceive that the Prophet in theſe words did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. Call upon the faithful to look upon him, his conſtancy and undaunted reſolution, (upon that expreſs revelation he had received from God) and upon his children, by whoſe myſterious and Prophetick names he had aſſured them of thoſe things that ſhould come to paſs, to wit, the good which God would do for his people, and the evil he would bring upon their enemies, that ſo their faith might be ſtrengthened thereby, and they encouraged againſt the terrors of the generality of the people. Or elſe, 2ly, bewail their condition, in that whilſt he and his children were ordered by God to be for Prophetick ſigns unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.2, 3.) they were for this hooted and pointed at, as ſo many monſters, ſcoffed at and flouted by the prophane multitude, as it is alſo ſaid, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Thou and thy fellows that ſit before thee, are men wondered at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, 2ly, ſome underſtand it of the faithful, ſuch as were <hi>ver.</hi> 16. called Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that believed and obeyed his Doctrine, whom he calls here the children which God had given him, becauſe through grace he had begotten them again unto God, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. And accordingly they conceive the words, <hi>Behold I and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſigns and wonders in Iſrael:</hi> To be ſpoken,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of complaining of the ineffectualneſs of his labours amongſt the people, and the great contempt that was caſt upon him and his Diſciples and followers, in that being but a few, and not going along with them in their way, they looked upon them as ſo many prodigies and monſters, (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.7.) and did reproach and deride them.</p>
               <p>And, 2. by way of rendring themſelves ready to be ordered by the Lord in all things, <hi>Behold I and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſigns and wonders in Iſrael,</hi> even amongſt Gods profeſſed people; as if he ſhould have ſaid, Let others do what they will, behold I and my children, my Diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, are ready and willing to reſt upon thy promiſes, to obey thy commands, and to make known thy will, whatever contempt and ſcorn we may endure for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>And then for the laſt words, <hi>From the Lord of Hoſts which dwelleth in mount Zion;</hi> they are added to imply, either, 1. That it was by Gods appointment that he and his children (if of them we underſtand the foregoing words) were Prophetick ſigns, and that his children were called by thoſe Prophetick n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes that were given them. And then God is here called <hi>the Lord of hoſts,</hi> purpoſely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42788:60"/>
to tax the incredulity of the people, that were ſo over-born with fear, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had a promiſe of deliverance from God, who was <hi>the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Or elſe,</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, That it was by expreſs warrant from God that he and his Diſciples did reſt upon Gods promiſe, and durſt not go in the way of the generality of the people in ſeeking after the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and that therefore however they boaſted of the God that dwelt in <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> yet the truth was, that by oppoſing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and reproaching them that were his faithful ſervants, they did oppoſe and deſpiſe the Lord of hoſts himſelf that dwelt there.</p>
               <p>Of, 3ly, that they knew it was not without the will and appointment of God, that they ſhould be ſo deſpiſed and derided, and hooted at by the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and therefore they would patiently bear it. Thus I conceive theſe words are to be underſtood. As for the Apoſtles applying thoſe words to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me,</hi> the ground of that was, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> being a type of Chriſt, that which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> there ſpake of himſelf, might well be applied to Chriſt, as ſpoken in his perſon, in regard that, 1. Chriſt did in our very nature exerciſe his Prophetical office; and, 2. that Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were by him begotten again to God, and in that regard might be called his children, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> called his Diſciples. 3. That it was by the ſpecial grace of God, that Chriſts Diſciples as well as the Prophets were ſo begotten again, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except my father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me.</hi> And, 4. that as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preſented his Diſciples to God, as ready to cleave to God, and to obey him in all things, ſo are the faithful conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſented before God by Chriſt their Mediator.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And when they ſhall ſay unto you, &amp;c.]</hi> Theſe are ſtill the words of the Prophet to the faithful. Becauſe this people were prone in time of great troubles and danger, to run to Sorcerers for counſel; therefore the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth the Faithful to beware that they were not drawn away by theſe, <hi>And when they ſhall ſay unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar Spirits, and unto Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards;</hi> that is Sorcerers, ſuch as were uſually called <hi>Cunning-men.</hi> The word in the Original which we tranſlate <hi>them that have familiar Spirits,</hi> is derived from an Hebrew word which ſignifieth <hi>a Bottle;</hi> becauſe when their evil Spirits entred into them, as ſometimes they did, they uſed to ſwell and blow up their Bodies like a bladder or bottle, and then gave anſwers from within them, out of their bellies, or out of their throats. And therefore are thoſe words added, I conceive by way of deriſion, <hi>that peep and that mutter,</hi> either firſt becauſe theſe evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſpake in them with a low, whiſpering and puling voice, like chickens not yet hatched; or with a hollow, grumbling and grunting voice, a broken and ſcarce articulate ſound, they could not well be heard or underſtood, that ſo they might the better deceive thoſe that heard them; or becauſe the witches or wizzards themſelves uſed a kind of muttering or low way of ſpeaking in their charms, or in the anſwers they gave, that they might ſtrike thoſe that repaired to them with the greater dread or awe of them. Or, 3. becauſe at leaſt they ſpake ſo obſcurely that their hearers did not know what to make of their words. And hence are the like expreſſions uſed by our Prophet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Thy ſpeech
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42788:60"/>
ſhall be low out of the duſt, and thy voice ſhall be as of one that hath a familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall whiſper out of the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Should not a people ſeek unto their God? &amp;c.]</hi> Theſe words may be taken either as an argument whereby the Prophet ſeeks to diſſwade them from harkening to ſuch ſeducers, or as the anſwer which they ſhould return to thoſe that ſhould perſwade them to go to witches and wizzards; as if it had been expreſſed thus, <hi>When they ſhall ſay unto you, ſeek unto them that have familiar ſpirits and unto wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,</hi> let this be your anſwer, <hi>ſhould not a people ſeek unto their God?</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, Every Nation will yield this, that in their ſtraits it is fit they ſhould ſeek to their God for counſel and direction; and ſhall not we much more do ſo, that ſerve the living and the true God? <hi>For the living to the dead?</hi> that is, will any rational men go to enquire of dead men on the behalf of thoſe that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? to wit, by ſeeking to witches that they may raiſe up the dead to give them counſel, concerning which ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10. Some I know read it <hi>from the living to the dead;</hi> intending thereby that it was a vain thing to go from the living Prophets, or from the living God to dead men. But I conceive it is better rendered, as in our Tranſlation, <hi>for the living to the dead;</hi> ſo to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply how abſurd a thing it was on the behalf of living men to go to enquire of dead men, that can know nothing of what is done upon earth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, let them ſeek to the Word of God for counſel and direction; which may include both the written word, (ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) or the preſent teaching of the Prophet or Prophets. <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this word,</hi> that is, according to what I now ſay, to wit, that men are not to enquire of witches nor wizzards, nor any where elſe, but only from the Word of God, <hi>It is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> or (as it is in the <hi>Hebrew) becauſe there is no morning in them,</hi> that is, becauſe they have no truth in them; or becauſe they are ſtark blind, void of common ſenſe and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And they ſhall paſs through it, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, this wicked people that would not rely upon God, but would ſeek help elſewhere, and go to witches and wizzards for advice, ſhall paſs through the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> to wit, either as the enemy are carrying them away captives into a ſtrange Country, or in a way of wandring up and down from one place to another to find ſome relief, help, and refuge, yet no where finding any, (no not in that land wherein God had promiſed to give them a quiet and ſetled habitation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8.) being every where hunted and purſued by their enemies, <hi>hardly beſtead and hungry,</hi> that is, ſuffering many hard and grievous things, being ſtripped and ſpoiled of all they enjoyed, and ready to ſtarve for want of food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and ſhall curſe their King and their God, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, being overwhelmed with miſery, out of extream impatience of ſpirit, and being ſtricken with a kind of deſperate rage and madneſs, they ſhall not only <hi>curſe their King,</hi> as judging him the cauſe of their calamities, in that he had called in the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or had ſome way ill managed the buſineſs with him, and ſo had provoked him againſt them, but <hi>their God</hi> alſo, to wit, becauſe he had not helped them. Some indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this laſt is meant of their falſe gods, whom they ſhould curſe when
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42788:61"/>
they ſhould by experience find how vainly they had expected help from them. But I ſee not but that it might be meant of the true God, and that this is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely added to ſet forth the extream height of their wickedneſs and fury, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is foretold of thoſe deſperate wretches under the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.10, 11. <hi>They gnawed their tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their pains.</hi> But however, if we underſtand it of their Idol-gods, very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable is the event of their ſin. They would not truſt in Gods promiſe, but forſook him, and placed all their hope in the policy of their King; and now the iſſue is, that they come to curſe their King and their falſe gods, to whom they (with their King) had given away the honour of the true God.</p>
               <p>As for the laſt words, <hi>and look upward,</hi> though ſome would have it imply, that being convinced of their former folly in reſting upon men, they ſhould now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to look Heavenward for help; yet becauſe it is joined ſo immediately with their curſing of God, I cannot think that can be intended. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that either here the Prophet begins to relate the deſperateneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in that firſt they ſhould in vain look upward to God for help, (for which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.42.) and afterwards to as little purpoſe ſhould look to the earth, as it is expreſſed in the following verſe; or elſe rather, that this is added the better to ſet forth the deſperate madneſs of theſe blaſpheming wretches, to wit, that even with their faces looking Heavenward they ſhould curſe God. All which moſt Expoſitors do underſtand of that miſerable condition whereinto this people were brought in the days of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 26.45, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And they ſhall look unto the earth, &amp;c.]</hi> They that underſtand the laſt words of the foregoing verſe, <hi>and look upward,</hi> of their looking to Heaven for help, do accordingly conceive, that here a reaſon is given why they ſhould at laſt look Heavenward, to wit, becauſe on earth there was nothing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered but miſery and ſorrow. But rather, the drift of the words is to imply, that in the whole land they ſhould find no hope of help and comfort; and ſo if that laſt Clauſe in the foregoing verſe were to imply, that they ſhould in vain look upward to Heaven for help, (as it is there noted that ſome hold) then theſe words are added, <hi>And they ſhall look unto the earth, and behold trouble and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to imply, that neither in Heaven nor on earth any hope of help ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſo that in their trouble they ſhould be as men in the dark not knowing which way to turn themſelves. The expreſſions here uſed are much like thoſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.30. concerning which ſee the Note there. And to the ſame purpoſe are the following words, <hi>dimneſs of anguiſh;</hi> and ſo alſo the laſt Clauſe, <hi>and they ſhall be driven to darkneſs;</hi> for this implies that their miſery, and their anguiſh, and perplexity of mind in their miſery, ſhould encreaſe daily more and more. A man driven headlong in the dark muſt needs fall the more deſperately. And ſo the Prophet would imply it ſhould be with them.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>NEvertheleſs the dimneſs ſhall not be ſuch, &amp;c.]</hi> Leſt the faithful ſhould be over-preſſed with fear and ſorrow, hearing of ſuch a ſad and a black day that was coming upon the land, in regard of thoſe grievous miſeries and ſtraits that ſhould befall them, mentioned in ſeveral places of the foregoing Chapter, and eſpecially in the laſt verſe, where he ſpeaks of <hi>the trouble, and darkneſs, and dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of anguiſh</hi> that ſhould come upon them, therefore the Prophet doth here add a promiſe by way of conſolation, telling them of that which might much allay the bitterneſs of the calamities which are there threatned. Some indeed hold that the promiſe made to the faithful begins not till the ſecond verſe. The firſt verſe they conceive it rather inſerted by way of aggravating the darkneſs threatned in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Nevertheleſs the dimneſs ſhall not be ſuch as was in her vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when at the firſt he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, No marvel though it be ſaid that the people ſhall be in ſuch perplexity, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, when the calamities there threatned ſhall come upon them; for this affliction when it comes, ſhall darken the land otherwiſe, that is, in a far more grievous manner than it was darkened by the invaſions of enemies in former times.</p>
               <p>And indeed if the calamities threatned in the foregoing Chapter <hi>(the dimneſs here ſpoken of)</hi> be underſtood of the deſtruction made in the land by the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the days of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple burnt, and the people were carried captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> that was in it ſelf a blacker day of diſtreſs than ever had been ſeen in the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had made the ſaddeſt havock amongſt them. Well, but yet becauſe this expreſſion, <hi>the dimneſs ſhall not be ſuch as was in her vexation,</hi> ſeems in an ordinary way of ſpeaking, to import that it ſhould not be ſo great; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe the following verſe ſeems plainly to be added, as a farther explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is ſaid here, <hi>The people that walked in darkneſs have ſeen a great light, &amp;c.</hi> therefore I rather conceive that the drift of this verſe alſo is to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their fears, by aſſuring them, that though the judgments threatned in the foregoing Chapter ſhould fall very heavy upon the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> yet in ſome reſpect it ſhould not <hi>be ſuch,</hi> that is, ſo great as it was in thoſe vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> mentioned in the latter part of the verſe. And accordingly I underſtand the words thus; <hi>Nevertheleſs the dimneſs,</hi> (to wit, that threatned in the foregoing Chapter, whether we underſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the calamities they underwent in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the land with ſuch a mighty army, or the grievous deſtruction that was brought upon them by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in the days of <hi>Zedekiah) ſhall not be ſuch,</hi> that is, in every reſpect ſo great <hi>as was in her vexation;</hi> that is, as it was when the land was vexed and afflicted by thoſe two Invaſions of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42788:62"/>
in the following words, <hi>when at the firſt he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali;</hi> which may be meant either firſt of that Invaſion of the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Pul</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> made an inroad into the Country in the days of <hi>Menahem,</hi> and then was preſently hired with a ſum of money to be gone again, for which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.19. which ſeems to me moſt probable; or elſe, 2. of that Invaſion made by <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> which fell chiefly indeed upon the Tribes of <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Naphtali,</hi> and wherein they might well be ſaid to be more <hi>lightly afflicted,</hi> becauſe then only ſome of the Tribes (about five of them) were carried away captives, and not all of them, as they were afterwards by <hi>Salmanaſſer;</hi> for which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. <hi>And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did more grievouſly afflict her;</hi> which may be meant of that more grievous hand of God upon the whole Kingdom of the Ten Tribes in the days of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> when by <hi>Salmanaſſer Samaria</hi> was taken, and the whole people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were carried away captives into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which ſee the Notes there. Or rather of the Invaſion of <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> which may be termed more grievous with reſpect to the foregoing inroad of <hi>Pul;</hi> which I think is far moſt probable; for whereas it may be, and it is uſually objected, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks here of calamities that had formerly come upon the land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and it is clear, that neither the Invaſion by <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> nor that by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> were come to paſs when the Prophet ſpake this, though indeed he lived to ſee them both accompliſhed. Though to this it may be anſwered, that it was uſual with the Prophets to ſpeak of things to come, as if they were paſt and done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, only to imply the certainty of them; yet I ſhould think that this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be better prevented by holding that the Prophet ſpeaks here of two Invaſions of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were in a manner paſt already, to wit, that of <hi>Pul,</hi> and that of <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> which was now immediately coming upon them, and in a manner in being. And indeed the following deſcription of that part of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was to feel the miſery of this more grievous affliction, agrees beſt with the Invaſion of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>glath-pileſer,</hi> and cannot ſo well be underſtood of that of <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> when the whole Kingdom of the Ten Tribes was over-run and diſpeopled; as firſt, in that this is ſaid to have been <hi>by the way of the Sea;</hi> for this cannot ſo well be meant of the midland-Sea, called <hi>the great Sea,</hi> Joſh. 1.4. which was the utmoſt border of the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> weſtward, and very far remote from <hi>Jordan</hi> (which is alſo here mentioned.) And that which is ſaid by ſome is altogether uncertain, to wit, that the tract of land of which he ſpeaks here, is ſaid to have been <hi>by the way of the Sea,</hi> becauſe there was a high-way in thoſe parts about <hi>Jordan,</hi> whereby they carried their wares, which were to be tranſported through the land to the Sea-ſide, which was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called <hi>the way of the Sea.</hi> And therefore I rather think it is meant of that part of the Country which lay upon <hi>the Lake of Genneſareth,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.1. which was alſo called <hi>the Sea of Cinnereth,</hi> Joſh. 13.27. or the Sea of <hi>Genne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſareth;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Sea of Galilee;</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The Sea of Tiberias.</hi> And the like may be ſaid of the following words, <hi>Beyond Jordan in Galilee of the Nations;</hi> or as ſome tranſlate it, <hi>in populous Galilee;</hi> for though the whole land of <hi>Galilee</hi> was divided into two parts, the one whereof was called the upper <hi>Galilee,</hi> and the other the lower, and ſome think the lower <hi>Galilee</hi> is here meant,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42788:62"/>
which was in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulun;</hi> and that it was called <hi>populous Galilee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo full of people: and others think the upper <hi>Galilee</hi> is here meant, which was in the Tribe of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> which they ſay was called <hi>Galilee of the Nations,</hi> becauſe there were many of the Heathens uſually inhabiting there, in regard that it was near to the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Zidonians,</hi> or for ſome other reaſon, (for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.11.) Yet, firſt, becauſe it is evident that the Prophet ſpeaks here of a ſtorm that fell upon thoſe parts of the land that lay near to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and not upon the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Ten Tribes; as that Invaſion of <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> did. 2. Becauſe it is clear that <hi>Tiglath-pileſer</hi> did indeed ſubdue and carry into captivity the Tribes without <hi>Jordan,</hi> and thoſe within <hi>Jordan,</hi> to wit, on the Eaſt-ſide of it, even all the inhabitants both of the upper and lower <hi>Galilee,</hi> (which may therefore be here ſaid to be <hi>beyond Jordan,</hi> with reſpect to thoſe without <hi>Jordan,</hi> that were at the ſame time carried away into captivity), ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. And 3. becauſe the Evangeliſt citing this paſſage of <hi>Iſaiah, Mat.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. ſeems to ſpeak of thoſe places about <hi>Jordan,</hi> where our Saviour firſt Preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; therefore it ſeems to me moſt probable that the Prophet ſpeaks here of the Invaſion of <hi>Tiglath-pileſer.</hi> Well, but however, whether this more grievous affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be meant of the Invaſion of <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> or of that of <hi>Salmanaſſer;</hi> yet if that judgment which the Prophet in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foretold ſhould come upon <hi>Judah,</hi> be meant of that deſtruction which was made by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the days of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, and both the City and the Temple it ſelf was ſacked and burnt, and the <hi>Jews</hi> for the generality were all carried away captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> (which was doubtleſs the greateſt blow that was ever given to the land) how can it be ſaid that <hi>the dimneſs</hi> then was <hi>not ſuch,</hi> that is, ſo great as it was <hi>in her vexation</hi> by thoſe two foregoing Invaſions of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians?</hi> Indeed if the judgment threatned againſt <hi>Judah</hi> in the foregoing Chapter, were the Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (which many think moſt probable) that might well be ſaid to be not ſo great as were the two foregoing Invaſions of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> But if that threatned in the foregoing Chapter were that dreadful ruin that was made in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in the land of <hi>Judah</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> how can that be ſaid to have been not ſo great as thoſe two Invaſions of the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes by the <hi>Aſſyrians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. Becauſe this dimneſs was not perpetual, as the other was. The <hi>Jews</hi> that were carried captives into <hi>Babylon</hi> returned afterward back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Country (which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were carried away by the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> never did) at which time both the City and Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built again.</p>
               <p>And, 2. Becauſe ſome few years after, the promiſed Meſſiah ſhould come, and then they ſhould enjoy the light of the Goſpel, which to the faithful ſhould yield ſo great comfort, that it would make them forget all their former ſufferings and ſorrows. And indeed it is clear, that the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> doth in the place above cited apply that which he ſaith there concerning the ſpringing up of the light of the Goſpel to the places here mentioned by the Prophet; implying that as thoſe parts firſt taſted of the miſeries here ſpoken of, ſo they ſhould be firſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42788:63"/>
revived by the bright ſhining of the Goſpel amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>The people that walked in darkneſs, have ſeen a great light, &amp;c.]</hi> This was in part accompliſhed, firſt, when <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army was deſtroyed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and ſo the ſiege was broken up, and the enemies were forced to fly out of the land with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſhame; for then the people of <hi>Judea</hi> might well be ſaid to <hi>have ſeen a great light,</hi> not only becauſe their joy muſt needs then be exceeding great, after ſuch a dark time of extream diſtreſs and ſorrow, but alſo becauſe their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſuch a miraculous way was ſo apparently the mighty hand and work of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Jews</hi> were delivered out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and brought back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own land, at which time ſome of the Ten Tribes alſo returned, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof it may be ſpoken of the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that when by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, and ſo the people were wholly taken off from the publick Worſhip of God, it might ſeem hereby that the Covenant betwixt God and them was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked off, and the hope they had of the promiſed Meſſiah was at end, therefore when the Lord had brought them back again from the land of their captivity, their joy muſt needs be exceeding great, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2, 3.</p>
               <p>But, 3. principally and moſt clearly by the coming of Chriſt, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the light of the Goſpel, when the <hi>Jews</hi> (and Gentiles too) were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the ſhining of that Sun of Righteouſneſs amongſt them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that blindneſs, and that bondage under ſin and Satan, wherein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they abode (whereof the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity was a type), and brought into an eſtate of clearer knowledg, and greater joy than ever that people had enjoyed before in the time of the Law. And indeed, as is partly noted before, this I conceive is the chief reaſon why <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Naphtali,</hi> and the land about <hi>Jordan,</hi> were particularly mentioned in the foregoing verſe, to wit, becauſe the light of the Goſpel did firſt break forth in thoſe parts; and there Chriſt wrought his firſt Miracles, and the chief of his Apoſtles were there firſt called. And the ſame is intended in the following words, <hi>They that dwell in the land of the ſhadow of death, upon them hath the light ſhined;</hi> for this alſo may comprehend both the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they ſeemed to have been in as hopeleſs a condition, as men are that lye dead in their graves, according to that which is ſaid of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.12. <hi>O my people, I will open your graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Iſrael.</hi> And likewiſe more eſpecially the deliverance of Chriſts redeemed ones from that darkneſs of ſin and death, both temporal and eternal, under which they lay by nature, ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 3.5. And obſervable it is, that to expreſs how certain it was that this ſhould be, the Prophet ſtill ſpeaks of that which was to come to paſs many years after, as if it were done already.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Thou haſt multiplied the Nation, and not encreaſed the joy, &amp;c.]</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſtill proceeds in a Prophetical ſtrain, ſpeaking of future things, as if they were paſt already. The words may be read, as it is in the Margent of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Thou haſt <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>he Nation, and to him encreaſed the joy;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Thou wilt multiply this Nation, and wilt increaſe their joy. And indeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42788:63"/>
we underſtand this of the joy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, either, 1. at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army that had beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Or, 2. at their deliverance from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity: Or, 3ly, at their deliverance by Chriſt, their promiſed Meſſiah, theſe two may well be joined together concerning the multiplying of the Nation, and the increaſing of their joy: Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had made great havock amongſt the people in the land, after his army was deſtroyed ſo miraculouſly, to the great joy of that Nation, God was pleaſed to cauſe them to multiply and thrive again, according to that promiſe made to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Chap. 37.31. <hi>And the remnant that is eſcaped of the houſe of Judah, ſhall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly, Becauſe after their joyful return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> through the bleſſing of God upon them, the people did great multiply, as was foretold by the Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.27. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will ſow the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah, with the ſeed of man, and with the ſeed of beaſt.</hi> And <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be inhabited as Towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattel therein.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, Becauſe at the coming of Chriſt, which was a time indeed of greateſt joy, the people of God were exceedingly multiplied, by the confluence of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Gentiles that joined themſelves to the Church of Chriſt. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 17.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this Marginal reading of the Text I cannot but judg far the moſt probable, becauſe according to this Tranſlation of the words, the meaning of the place is ſo clear and eaſie; whereas if we read it as it is in our Bibles, <hi>Thou haſt multiplied the Nation, and not increaſed the joy;</hi> there ſeems to be a manifeſt contradiction betwixt this and the following words, <hi>They joy before thee according to the joy in harveſt, and as men rejoice when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſpoil.</hi> Whence it is that ſo many ways have been found out by Expoſitors to ſalve this ſeeming contradiction: For, firſt, ſome underſtand the firſt part of the verſe of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> to wit, that though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had raiſed, or though God by his Providence had ſuffered him to raiſe a very numerous army, yet their joy was not anſwerable thereto, becauſe by the ſword of an Angel there was ſuch havock made amongſt them, as they lay before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo they returned not home rejoicing and triumphing in their victory, as they thought to have done. And then the following words they underſtand of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to wit, that they had cauſe of abundant joy, though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had none. <hi>They joy before thee according to the joy in harveſt, and as men rejoice when they divide the ſpoil.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, Some underſtand both branches of the verſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the days of the Goſpel, that then they were many in number, as God had promiſed, or that they were multiplied by the acceſs of the Gentiles, who joined themſelves to the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but that this was without any great joy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Nation to whom Chriſt and the Goſpel were peculiarly promiſed, becauſe ſo few of them did embrace the faith of Chriſt; or becauſe they did very much envy the Preaching of the Goſpel amongſt the Gentiles, or becauſe they were within a few years after rooted out by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Or elſe, of the Church of Chriſt, as made up both of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles; to wit, that though Gods people were then mightily increaſed in number, yet their joy was not anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42788:64"/>
and that becauſe of the grievous perſecutions, and the manifold calamities and miſeries that were continually their portion. And now becauſe in both theſe joys there was a mixture of much grief and trouble of ſpirit, therefore they ſay in the following words, this joy of theirs is compared to the joy of men in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, when their joy is mixed with a great deal of toil and labour; and to the joy of thoſe that divide the ſpoil, which is not obtained without much hardſhip, and after many ſharp and bitter conflicts.</p>
               <p>But, 3ly, others underſtand that the Prophet in the firſt part of the verſe ſpeaks of the <hi>Jews</hi> in former times, to wit, that God had exceedingly <hi>multiplied</hi> that Nation in former ages, as he had promiſed (under which term ſome alſo comprehend the advancing of them, and their growing great in riches, power, and many glorious victories); but that their joy then was comparatively nothing in regard of that joy they ſhould have in the breaking forth of that light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had ſpoken in the foregoing verſe. Then their joy ſhould be ſuch as it had never been ſince God began firſt to multiply that Nation; which is therefore ſet forth in the following words by thoſe expreſſions, <hi>They joy before thee according to the joy in harveſt, &amp;c.</hi> And this may be underſtood of their joy: Either, 1. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was delivered from <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army. Or, 2. when the <hi>Jews</hi> were delivered from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity. Or, 3. when Chriſt came to deliver them from the bondage of Sin, Satan, Death and Hell. And indeed becauſe it is expreſly ſaid, that the joy of this Nation when they were returned out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and had begun to build their City and Temple again, was not ſo great as it had been in former times, ſee the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12. therefore I conceive the joy the Prophet here ſpeaks of, is chiefly meant of the joy that redounded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by Chriſt; which was indeed as much greater than all the joys of Gods people in former ages had been, as the light of the Sun is greater than the light of a candle; and that becauſe this was the greateſt mercy that ever was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gods people, and becauſe the light of the knowledg of God, and the way of Salvation was far more clearly diſcovered and imparted to them, than ever it had been in former times. As for that expreſſion, <hi>they joy before thee, &amp;c.</hi> either that is ſpoken with reſpect to the thank-offerings and praiſes which they offered up unto God, upon their deliverances, in the Sanctuary, and in the aſſemblies of his people. Or elſe to ſet forth the heartineſs, and reality, and ſincerity of their joy, to wit, that they ſhould be indeed heartily and inwardly joyed, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods wonderful work in their deliverance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For thou haſt broken, &amp;c.]</hi> Here the Prophet ſhews us what the ground ſhould be of that wonderful joy promiſed to Gods people in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, to wit, Gods wonderful delivering of them from that miſerable bondage under which they had been ſorely oppreſſed; which as it may be partly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance both from that bondage under which <hi>Sennacherib</hi> endeavoured to bring them, and from the yoke of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity; yet it muſt be principally underſtood as looking farther, even to that great redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people by Chriſt, when the yoke of Satan, and ſin, and the world, and death, and hell was broken, and they were brought into the glorious liberty of Gods children. <hi>Thou haſt broken the yoke of his burden,</hi> that is, the burdenſome yoke of that bondage, and thoſe many heavy preſſures under which thy people
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42788:64"/>
lay; <hi>and the ſtaff of his ſhoulder,</hi> that is, the ſtaff wherewith their ſhoulders were beaten; <hi>the rod of the oppreſſor,</hi> that is, the tyrannical rule of thoſe that oppreſſed him, or the rod wherewith their task-maſters were wont to beat them, by way of forcing them to pay their taxes, or to diſpatch thoſe works of drudgery that were impoſed upon them; <hi>as in the day of Midian,</hi> that is, totally, and eaſily, and wholly by the out-ſtretched arm of God, without the help of man and military forces, as when <hi>Gideon</hi> overcame the <hi>Midianites.</hi> And to this it is thought the deliverance here promiſed is compared, becauſe the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army, and from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, but eſpecially our deliverance by Chriſt, was indeed effected, not by the power of man and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of war, but ſolely by the almighty power of God, and becauſe in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Gideons</hi> vanquiſhing the <hi>Midianites</hi> there was ſuch a notable typical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the victory of Chriſt and his members over Satan, that great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor of his people, for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.19.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For every battel of the warrier is with confuſed noiſe, &amp;c.]</hi> If we read this verſe according to the Tranſlation that is ſet in the Margent of our Bibles, <hi>When the whole battel of the warrier was with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood, &amp;c.</hi> then the whole verſe ſeems clearly to be meant of that overthrow of the <hi>Midianites</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe, when the whole army of the <hi>Midianites</hi> being ſuddenly ſtruck with a panick fear, there was a confuſed noiſe amongſt them, and they fell upon, and flew one another, ſo that they lay tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their own blood. And if we thus read the Text, then the meaning of the laſt clauſe, <hi>and it was with burning and fuel of fire,</hi> muſt needs be this, either that the bodies of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> together with their garments, being thus ſoaked and ſpoiled with the abundance of blood that was ſpilt, were fain to be burnt, and made fuel of fire; or elſe that by this their ſlaughtering one another, their whole army was eaſily, inſtantly, and utterly deſtroyed, as when any combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter is ſuddenly conſumed and burnt up with a flaming fire. But now if we read it, as it is in our Bibles, as conſiſting of two parts, the one oppoſed to the other, <hi>For every battel of the warrier is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood, but this ſhall be with burning and fuel of fire,</hi> then theſe words muſt needs be added to ſet forth, why he had compared the deliverance now promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to that of <hi>Gideons</hi> victory over the <hi>Midianites,</hi> namely, becauſe it ſhould be effected in a ſtrange and miraculous way, and not by the vanquiſhing of their enemies in battel, as uſually people are delivered; <hi>For every battel of the warrier is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood,</hi> that is, with the confuſed noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, the clattering of arms, and neighing of horſes, the ſhouting of Soldiers, and the cries and skreeks of men wounded and ſlain, that lay weltring in their blood; <hi>but this ſhall be with burning and fuel of fire,</hi> that is, this deliverance of Gods people which is now promiſed, ſhall not be effected by the power of man, by fighting and bloodſhed, but by the almighty power of God, conſuming the enemy on a ſudden in a miraculous way, as with a flame of fire. And this ſome think is meant of that miraculous deſtruction of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheribs</hi> army, that had beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which was effected without any tumult of a battel, without any fighting or bloodſhed, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> army being ſuddenly ſlain in the dead of the night by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42788:65"/>
ſtroke of an Angel, and ſo were deſtroyed, as if they had been ſmitten with lightning from Heaven, and burnt up and conſumed like ſo much fuel of fire. But others underſtand it of the deliverance of Gods people by Chriſt from the bondage of Sin and Satan, which is not accompliſhed by weapons of war, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and bloodſhed, but by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God, purifying their hearts, and burning up their luſts and corruptions, the ſtrong holds of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. even as when any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter is burnt up and conſumed by fire. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. Or elſe (as ſome think) of Chriſts deſtroying the enemies of his people in a ſtrange and wonderful way, and his making them at laſt the fuel of Hell-fire.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>For unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given.]</hi> To wit, Jeſus Chriſt, the great gift of Gods free Grace, who as he was the only begotten Son of God, (ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.) ſo he was alſo a child conceived and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> the ſame that was before foretold by the name <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> Chap. 7.14. (for which ſee the Note there; for much is there ſaid to ſhew the ground why theſe Propheſies concerning Chriſt are inſerted in theſe places, and to prove that they cannot be meant of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> would have it.) To imply the certainty of that which is here foretold, the Prophet ſtill expreſſeth this which was to be done many years after, as if it were done already, <hi>For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a child is born, &amp;c.</hi> where by thoſe words <hi>unto us,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation may be primarily and peculiarly meant, from whoſe Royal ſtock he was deſcended, according to that which the Angel ſaid to the ſhepherds, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is clear, which is obſervable, that Chriſt was given of God to be a Saviour, even to thoſe that lived in the days of the Old Teſtament. But withal they muſt be extended to all mankind in general, becauſe this Son of God by taking mans nature upon him, became a Saviour for man in general, upon condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him; and becauſe all that do believe in him (to whom only he is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually given to be a Saviour) become ſpiritually the ſeed, and are joined in one body with the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now this concerning the birth of Chriſt is here inſerted, as a reaſon of all that was ſaid before, <hi>For unto us a child is born, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Becauſe the deliverance of Gods people by Chriſt was the great mercy that was principally intended in the foregoing promiſes, the victory which was to be accompliſhed without tumult and bloodſhed, and that which ſhould be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch exceeding great joy to them; ſee the foregoing Notes, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. 2ly, Becauſe the great mercy intended in thoſe temporal deliverances, included alſo in the foregoing promiſes, to wit, that when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſaved from <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> and that of the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was the preſervation of the Royal ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> that ſo from thence this great Redeemer the Lord was to ſpring, in whom that Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was to be continued unto eternity, and by whom the reſtauration of the Church, begun in the return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> was to be perfected and brought to a more flouriſhing and joyful eſtate than ever. And, 3ly, Becauſe even thoſe temporal deliverances of the <hi>Jews</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were effected by this their Meſſiah, and the virtue of the great work of his Redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder.]</hi> That is, God ſhall appoint him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42788:65"/>
to be the King of his Church, and impoſe upon him the Government of his Church, yea he ſhall make him his Viceroy for the ruling and governing of the whole world under him, that ſo he may the better protect and provide for his Church, and order all things for the benefit and advantage thereof. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. This phraſe, <hi>The Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder,</hi> may ſeem to allude to the cuſtom of carrying a Scepter upon the ſhoulder, as the ſign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power; as the like is noted in that which is ſaid concerning <hi>Eliakim,</hi> Chap. 22.22. <hi>The key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder;</hi> but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is clear, that God ſhould commit the Government of the Church to him, and ſo the care of it ſhould in all regards lye upon him, and he ſhould uphold it with his care and power; he ſhould not commit the Government of it to others, as needing no other to help him to bear the burthen of it, but he ſhould manage it wholly by his own power; and whereas other Kings are wont to be burdenſome to their ſubjects, it ſhould not be ſo with him, becauſe he ſhould bear his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as his burden. Yet there may be alſo in theſe words an alluſion to that which he had ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou haſt broken the ſtaff of his ſhoulder;</hi> and ſo the drift of them may be to imply, that having freed them from the tyrannous oppreſſion of their enemies, they ſhould live as a free and happy people under his juſt and righteous Government.</p>

See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14. 3ly, <hi>The mighty God,</hi> which ſhews clearly that this cannot be underſtood of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or any other mortal man, but only of the Lord Chriſt. 4ly, <hi>The Everlaſting-Father,</hi> to wit, becauſe it is he that regenerates the faithful in all ages, and is <hi>the father of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> the author of life eternal to all that believe on him. And, 5ly, <hi>The Prince of Peace,</hi> to wit, becauſe he ſhould not advance his Kingdom by force of arms, but in a way of peace; becauſe he makes our peace with God, and united <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles together, as one people; and becauſe he is the ſole author of all the peace of his people, outward and inward, temporal and eternal. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Of the increaſe of his Government and peace there ſhall be no end, &amp;c.]</hi> This is added with reſpect to the laſt Title, given to Chriſt in the foregoing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42788:66"/>
verſe, <hi>The Prince of Peace,</hi> to wit, that the extending of his Principality and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the peace and proſperity thereof, ſhould never come to an end, but ſhould ſtill proceed farther and farther; which is eſpecially accompliſhed by the enlargement of his Kingdom amongſt the Gentiles. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. And obſervable it is, that by foretelling the increaſe of the peace of his Kingdom, together with the great extent of his dominions, theſe ſingular priviledges are implied, 1. That his Kingdom ſhould be carried on, not by the ſword, but by the Goſpel of peace. And, 2. that whereas the enlargement of other Princes Kingdoms do uſually tend to their ruin, it ſhould not be ſo with his. As for that which followeth, 1. It is ſaid that this his Government ſhould be <hi>upon the throne of David, and upon his Kingdom,</hi> becauſe Chriſt was <hi>Davids</hi> ſon and heir, and <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom was a type of Chriſts, ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.11, 16. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132.11. And accordingly even in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſeat of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom, Chriſt Preached the Goſpel, and was owned as the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and vanquiſhed the ſpiritual enemies; and from thence the Goſpel of the Kingdom went forth into all the world. 2ly, It is ſaid that this ſhould be <hi>to order it, and to eſtabliſh it,</hi> that is, for the well-ordering, the ſtrengthening and ſetling of his Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>with judgment and with juſtice,</hi> that is, with juſt judgment; or by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked, and protecting and rewarding the righteous. See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.12. And, 3ly, it is ſaid that this ſhall be <hi>from henceforth even for ever,</hi> that is, from the time that Chriſt in mans nature ſhall undertake the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, unto all eternity. And, 4ly, becauſe the accompliſhing of theſe great things which he had promiſed, might in the declining eſtate of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom ſeem impoſſible, therefore he addeth that clauſe, <hi>The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this;</hi> for which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.31.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The Lord ſent a word in to Jacob, &amp;c.]</hi> It is not a matter of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to know whether this be a new Prophecy, or a continuation of that which went before; clear it is, that after the interlacing of the foregoing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes, the Prophet here returns to foretell the judgments that were coming upon the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that for the comfort of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were now terrified with the confederacy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> againſt them. <hi>The Lord ſent a word into Jacob,</hi> that is, the Lord hath by me, or rather by the many Prophets that have been ſent to them, made known the ruin that is coming upon the poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Ten Tribes; <hi>and it hath lighted upon Iſrael,</hi> that is, it ſhall light upon <hi>Iſrael;</hi> however they flatter themſelves, even upon them it ſhall fall; it ſhall certainly come upon them, as it hath been foretold. See the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Yet there are ſome Expoſitors that would have it underſtood thus, <hi>and it hath lighted upon Iſrael,</hi> that is, the word ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, was accordingly delivered to them, and known amongſt them, falling amongſt them, as the ſeed doth on the ground where it is ſown.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And all the people ſhall know, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, when the judgment threatned ſhall come upon them, then they ſhall all know to their coſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, that it was indeed the word of God that was ſpoken to them, though now they will not believe it, but do vainly flatter themſelves, <hi>even Ephraim,</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.9.] <hi>and the inhabitants of Samaria,</hi> that is, of the Kingdom of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to wit, the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> or rather the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

of the City <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Royal and chief City of that Kingdom; who are particularly mentioned by way of intimating to them that they ſhould not eſcape by the ſtrength of their fortifications, but ſhould the rather be deſtroyed for their vain confidence therein, as is more clearly ſet forth in the following words, <hi>that ſay in the pride and ſtoutneſs of heart,</hi> to wit, that which is added in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn ſtones, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, our enemies have beaten down our brick-buildings, but we will build them again of hewn ſtones, which will be far more coſtly, and ſtrong and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>the Sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars;</hi> that is, they have hewn and broken down our houſes made of the timber of Sycamore-trees, which was of no great reckoning; but we will build others of Cedar-Timber, far more ſtately and laſting. Some, I know, underſtand this laſt Clauſe of planting Cedars in the room of thoſe Sycamore-trees, which the enemies had cut down, when they made all the ſpoil they could in the Countrey; which cannot ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be thought to be here intended. But however the meaning of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Expreſſions is, that though their State and Land had ſuffer'd much by their Enemies, yet they would ſoon bring all things into a more ſplendid and glorious condition than ever they had been in before; inſomuch that the ruines the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had made ſhould prove an advantage to them, as being an occaſion of making their Cities more beautiful, and their defences and fortifications ſtronger, than they were before. And moſt probable it is, that this is meant of that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock which <hi>Pul</hi> had made in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 Kin. 15.19. Or elſe it muſt be meant of that which after him <hi>Tiglath-Pileſer</hi> was to make amongſt them, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 15.29.</p>

Firſt he tells them, how the Lord would raiſe up Adverſaries againſt <hi>Rezin,</hi> with whom they had made a Confederacy, and on whoſe ſide they did ſo much rely, and would make them prevail over him; which is meant of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who did indeed invade <hi>Syria,</hi> and took <hi>Damaſcus</hi> their chief City, and ſlew <hi>Rezin,</hi> 2 Kin. 16.9. And then he adds, <hi>And joyn his enemies together;</hi> which ſome would have to be underſtood of the many Nations that ſhould be joyned together in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Rezin.</hi> But I rather think, that having firſt ſhewed how the Lord would cut off <hi>Rezin,</hi> in whoſe Confederacy they ſo much gloried, he then adds, that this being done, he would then <hi>joyn his enemies together,</hi> that is, <hi>Iſraels</hi> Enemies, to wit, thoſe mentioned in the following words.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>The Syrians before, and the Philiſtins behinde,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the <hi>Syrians,</hi> in whoſe help they put ſo much confidence, being ſubdued by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and become his Subjects, ſhall come under his conduct; and being joyned with his Forces, ſhall invade the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> at the ſame time ſhall invade them on the other ſide; <hi>And they ſhall devour Iſrael with open mouth,</hi> that is, As ſo many ravenous beaſts, that with open mouth fall upon their prey, they ſhall with all greadineſs and eagerneſs ſeek utterly to devour and deſtroy them. <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> For which ſee the Note, Chap. 5.25.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Therefore the Lord will cut off from Iſrael head and tail,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all of all ſorts, from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the chiefeſt to the baſeſt and moſt deſpiſed amongſt the people, ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.13. And ſuch another Proverbial Form of Speech is that which follows, <hi>Branch and ruſh:</hi> For thereby ſeems to be meant, both the ſtrong and weak; or more particularly, their choice young men, the beauty of each Family from whence they ſprang, as the Branch doth out of the Tree; and likewiſe thoſe of the poorer and meaner ſort of people. And it is ſaid, that this ſhould be done <hi>in one day;</hi> that is, at one and the ſame time; they ſhould be all cut off ſuddenly and together: Which was done when they were all carried away into Captivity by <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> and other Nations planted in their ſtead, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. But withal obſervable it is, that in ſetting forth this deſtruction of the Kingdom of the Tribes, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the cutting off <hi>the branch,</hi> not the cutting down of the tree; becauſe the root and ſtock of this people was ſtill to be preſerved. Nor is it wholly to be diſregarded which ſome add, that in thoſe words, <hi>The Lord will cut off from Iſrael head and tail;</hi> He ſpeaks of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as of a people that were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a beaſt, and that to imply their Wickedneſs and brutiſh Sins.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>The ancient and the honourable, he is the head,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prince and Magiſtrate, he that is of high account for Age or Office, <hi>he is the Head;</hi> to wit, becauſe the Magiſtrate doth take care for, order and govern the people, even as the Head doth the Body. As for the word <hi>honourable,</hi> See the Note Chap. 3.3. <hi>And the Prophet that teacheth Lies, he is the tail:</hi> And I conceive lying Prophets are ſo called, to imply, how baſe ſuch men were in the eſteem both of God and good men, according to that which God ſpake of the wicked Prieſts, Mal. 2.9. <hi>I have made you contemptible and baſe before all the people.</hi> Yet it might be alſo ſpoken with reſpect to their abject and baſe outward condition, becauſe it is likely that their falſe Prophets were of the meaneſt and loweſt of the people, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſts alſo were; See the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.31. Neither is it wholly to be diſregarded what ſome Learned Expoſitors have added, that the Prophet that taught Lies, might well be compared to the Tail: 1. Becauſe inſtead of going before the people with holy Doctrine, and an exemplary holy Life and Converſation, as it was fit the Lord's Prophets ſhould do, they were ſtill ready to comply with the people, the great ones eſpecially, in ſaying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they would have them ſay, and doing whatſoever they would have them do, turning and winding themſelves after them; even as the tail of a beaſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and turns about which way ſoever the beaſt goeth. And 2. Becauſe for their Bellies ſake, even <hi>for pieces of Bread,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, Ezek. 13.19. they were wont with vile and ſordid Flatteries to fawn upon the People, and eſpecially thoſe that were in high places, even as dogs (to whom ſuch lying Prophets are compared, Chap. 56.11.) uſe to fawn upon men with wagging their tails. Now if it be queſtioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why the Prophet doth not here explain what was meant in the foregoing verſe by <hi>branch and ruſh,</hi> as well as what was meant by <hi>head and tail:</hi> To this it is anſwered, that the reaſon of this was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42788:67"/>
he intended chiefly to ſtrike at thoſe that were the chiefeſt Offenders, and that were a main cauſe of all the wickedneſs that was amongſt the people. Yet it may be that which follows, verſ. 17. may be added to explain that Proverbial expreſſion of the <hi>branch and ruſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>For the Leaders of this people cauſe them to err,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, Chap. 3.12. This is added as a reaſon why God would cut off both <hi>head and tail;</hi> to wit, Becauſe the Leaders were Seducers, and the people were ſo ready to be miſled by them.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Therefore the Lord ſhall have no joy in their young men,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be intended to explain what was meant before, verſ. 14. by <hi>branch and ruſh.</hi> And the meaning is, That whereas uſually when the people of God do walk as becomes his people, the Lord doth rejoyce in them, and in ſeeing them in a proſperous condition, according to that, Chap. 65.19. <hi>I will rejoyce in Jeruſalem, and joy in my people;</hi> and that which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Lord hath pleaſure in the Proſperity of his Servants,</hi> Pſal. 35.27. See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.63. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is delighted to ſee their young men to grow up and proſper, as being a chief ſtay and ſtrength for them: Now on the contrary, becauſe of their ſins, he would not rejoyce in them, nor in their young men, nor in any thing that ſhould be for their welfare; but as being grieved at their wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10. He would not ſpare them nor ſhew them any favour, but would puniſh and deſtroy them. This I conceive is the full intent of this expreſſion. Yet it may be underſtood Figuratively thus, <hi>The Lord ſhall have no joy in their young men;</hi> that is, he will deteſt and abhor them: <hi>Neither ſhall have mercy on the fatherleſs and widows;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Though theſe even bloody enemies are ſometimes wont to ſpare; or, though God be uſually very favourable to theſe, and very tenderly careful and watchful over them; yet now he will not ſpare them, he will regard neither Sex, nor Age, nor State; <hi>For every one is an hypocrite, and an evil d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er, and every mouth ſpeaketh folly, or villany,</hi> as it is in the Margin. The meaning is, That they were not aſhamed openly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently to declare their wickedneſs: <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away,</hi> &amp;c. See the Note, Chap. 5.25.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>For wickedneſs burneth as the fire, &amp;c.]</hi> Some underſtand this meerly of the growth of wickedneſs amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to wit, that as a fire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter doth ſpread and riſe higher and higher, ſo had all kind of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs grown and increaſed amongſt that people, ſo that it had overſpread the whole land, and was grown up to a mighty height. But the words ſeem plainly to intend the deſtruction of a people. And therefore I take this to be the meaning of them, that as a fire kindled in the underwood, the briers and thorns, in ſome great wood or foreſt, doth firſt devour them, and then afterward taking hold of the higher trees, doth likewiſe conſume them, (which is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>It ſhall devour the briers and thorns, it ſhall kindle in the thickets of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi>), ſo this peoples <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> by reaſon of the wrath of God it would bring upon men, ſhould conſume and deſtroy the whole people, even in the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous places, from the loweſt to the higheſt; ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 83.14. <hi>And they ſhall mount up like the lifting up of ſmoke,</hi> that is, the people being made the fuel of Divine vengeance, ſhall be utterly conſumed, and vaniſh away to nothing. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.20. yet ſome add, that hereby
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42788:68"/>
may alſo be implied, that their puniſhments ſhould be a terror to all that were about them.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Through the wrath of the Lord of Hoſts is the land darkned, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be brought into a very calamitous, ſad, dreadful and hopeleſs condition, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.22. In this expreſſion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Prophet alludes to the laſt words of the foregoing verſe, <hi>they ſhall mount up like the lifting up of ſmoke;</hi> as is the more evident by the following words, <hi>and the people ſhall be as the fuel of the fire,</hi> concerning which ſee the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note: <hi>No man ſhall ſpare his brother,</hi> that is, as men in the dark, they ſhall fall foul upon one another, and conſume and deſtroy one another. The land ſhall be full of uproars, ſeditions, and civil diſſentions, wherein they ſhall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſpoil and deſtroy one another, not ſparing their neareſt relations; which yet cannot be meant of thoſe civil outrages mentioned, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. becauſe they were before this was Prophecyed. Leſt the people ſhould flatter themſelves with a vain hope that none of the evil here threatned by the Prophet ſhould come upon them, becauſe there was no appearance nor likelihood of any enemy that ſhould invade them, therefore they are told, that rather than God would want thoſe that ſhould execute his vengeance upon them, he would arm them againſt themſelves, and make every one deſtroy his brother.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And he ſhall ſnatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he ſhall eat on the left hand, and they ſhall not be ſatisfied, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, they ſhall ſpoil and plunder all that are about them on every ſide, without making any difference of the perſons of whom they make a prey, whether they be rich or poor, ſtrangers or near relations; like ſo many famiſhed, ſtarved men, they ſhall ſnatch at every thing they come nigh, and yet after all this they ſhall ſtill be hungry and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; which is added, either to imply the extream ſcarcity that ſhould be in the land, in that thoſe that uſed ſuch violence to ſupply their wants, ſhould not be able to get enough to ſatisfie the neceſſity of nature; or elſe to imply their inſatiable covetouſneſs or cruelty, and the apparent curſe of God that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>They ſhall eat every man the fleſh of his own arm;</hi> that is, they ſhall prey upon their neareſt Relations, being herein like ſo many diſtracted men, or ſo many men turned mad with extremity of hunger, that gnaw and eat their own fleſh. Yea, becauſe by ſpoiling and deſtroying their Brethren, they ſpoiled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thoſe that might have been a defence to them; therefore it is ſaid, that they ſhould eat not only their own fleſh, but alſo the fleſh of their own arm.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Manaſſeh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſhall rob, and eat, and devour <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall do the ſame to <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> Theſe two Tribes are particularly mentioned, becauſe they were obliged to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſomewhat a more ſingular relation, as being not only deſcended from <hi>Jacob,</hi> as the other Tribes alſo were; but likewiſe as being both of them the Poſterity of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which the other Tribes were not: And therefore it was the worſe in them mutually to ſpoil and deſtroy one another: <hi>And they together ſhall be againſt Judah:</hi> that is, They ſhall both joyn together to deſtroy their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> though that were the Tribe to whom God had aſſigned the Regal Power, and from whom God had promiſed their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould deſcend. And this haply might be accompliſhed, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the ten Tribes were ſubdued by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſo might ſerve under the

command of <hi>Sennacherib, Eſwhaddon</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when they invaded the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi> As for that clauſe, which was before twice inſerted, verſ. 12, and 17. <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away,</hi> &amp;c. See the Notes, chap 5.25.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,</hi> &amp;c.] Here again the Prophet returns to mention ſome notorious Sins, for which the Judgments before threatned ſhould come upon them; as namely, the Oppreſſions of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: which he the rather inſiſts on, to let them know, that as they had a chief hand in the Sins of the Land, ſo they ſhould be the firſt or the chief in the Puniſhment: <hi>Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees;</hi> that is, the Princes that make unrighteous Laws, and the Judges that pronounce unjuſt Sentences in Courts of Judgment. And the very ſame thing may be intended by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clauſe, <hi>And that write grievouſly what they have preſcribed;</hi> that is, That cauſe Laws, or Decrees, to be written down, entred and enrolled, that were very grievous and burdenſome to the poor Subjects, not being aſhamed that they ſhould be kept as a publick Monument of their Injuſtice. But yet there are divers Learned Expoſitors that do rather read the ſecond Clauſe, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>And to the writers that write grievouſneſs which they have preſcribed,</hi> and ſo hold that Judgment is here denounced ſeverally; 1. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that made ſuch unrighteous Laws, and pronounced ſuch unjuſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: And 2. againſt their Scribes or Regiſters, that were ſubſervient to them, in writing and enrolling theſe Decrees; which to me ſeems moſt probable.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>To turn aſide the needy from judgment,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, To keep the poor from being able to proceed in a courſe of Law before their Tribunals againſt thoſe that wrong them, and ſo at laſt to get a day of hearing; or ſome way to obſtruct the courſe of Law, that Juſtice ſhall not be done them, nor a juſt Sentence pronounced for them; which laſt is more clearly expreſſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>And to take away the right from the poor of my people.</hi> Some would limit the Injuſtice of thoſe Laws and Decrees, whereby the Judgment of the poor was turned aſide, to their making the Fees and Charges of Law-ſuits ſo inſupportable, that a poor man could not in a way of Law ſeek at any time to right himſelf. But I ſee not why it ſhould be limited to this. Many other ways the poor might be kept from having Juſtice done them. As for that expreſſion, <hi>The poor of my people.</hi> See the Notes, Chap. 3.12, 15. <hi>That widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherleſs.</hi> See the Notes, Chap. 1.17, 23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And what will ye do,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken to the unjuſt Princes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the two foregoing verſes; <hi>And what will you do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhall come from far?</hi> That is, from the Land of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Even their coming from a Countrey ſo far off, did imply them to be a mighty Nation; becauſe elſe they could not have born the charge of ſo great an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But ſee the Notes, Chap. 5.26. and 7.17, 18. And ſee the Note alſo Job 31.14. <hi>To whom will ye flee for help?</hi> As if he had ſaid, You that would not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42788:69"/>
be a refuge to the poor, when they fled to you for help, ſhall in that day find no refuge for your ſelves. Your great friend <hi>Rezin</hi> will then be cut off; and the <hi>Syrians,</hi> now your Confederates, ſhall then joyn with your Enemies againſt you (ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.12.) and your Idol-gods will be then found no way able to defend you, ſo that you will be left deſtitute of any help: <hi>And where will you leave your Glory?</hi> that is, your Riches and your Bravery, wherein you did ſo exceedingly glory? where will ye find a place wherein you may ſecure them? where will ye find any to whoſe truſt ye may commit them, that ſo afterwards ye may receive them back again? As if he ſhould have ſaid, Alas, there will be no ſaving them, the enmy will make a prey of them all. And could they be hidden in any place of ſafety, when you are carried away into captivity what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or advantage will the ſecuring of them be unto you? Or elſe by their <hi>Glory</hi> may be meant their Honour and Greatneſs, their Dignity and Eminency in the World: <hi>Where will ye leave your Glory?</hi> It is Ironically ſpoken; as if he had ſaid, And what will then become of your Glory? you will then be caſt down from your high ſtate and dignity. Now ye exalt your ſelves above the people like ſo many Demi-gods, and very glorious titles of honour are ſtill given you; but who will make any reckoning of your greatneſs and glory, or give you any ſuch titles in that day? The Sword of the enemy will put no difference betwixt you and the meaneſt of the people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Without me they ſhall bow down under the priſoners, and they ſhall fall under the ſlain,</hi> &amp;c.] According to this Tranſlation of ours, the meaning muſt needs be, either 1. That were it not that God had reſpect to the glory of his Name, and to his faithfulneſs in making good his Promiſes, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolve to remember mercy in the midſt of Judgment; they ſhould be all miſerably deſtroyed, either captivated or ſlain. Or 2ly. That they ſhould be all made Priſoners or ſlain, but without any fault in God; their deſtruction would be wholly of themſelves, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. Or 3ly. That becauſe they had caſt off God, and God had juſtly caſt off them, therefore as a people that had no intereſt in God, nor hope of help from God, they ſhould be moſt miſerably deſtroyed. For this, <hi>They ſhall bow down-under the priſoners, and they ſhall fall under the ſlain,</hi> may be an Hyperbolical expreſſion, implying, either 1. That they ſhould humble themſelves, crouch and bow to their enemies, even beneath thoſe that are taken Priſoners, and thoſe that are ſlain; or rather, 2ly. That their miſery ſhould exceed the miſery of thoſe that were extreamly miſerable, that they ſhould be more hardly, cruelly, and reproachfully uſed, than other captives and ſlain men uſed to be. And this was done when <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> took <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 King. 17.6. And obſervable it is alſo, that this is ſpoken to their wicked Princes and Judges; as if it had been ſaid, And this ſhall be the end of all your Glory. As for that which is again repeated, <hi>for all this his anger is not turned away,</hi> &amp;c. See the Note above <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.25.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>O Aſſyrian,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet begins to threaten the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with deſtruction, and that to ſupport and comfort his faithful ones amongſt his people, as giving them to underſtand hereby, that though for a time he might make uſe of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> by way of ſcourging his people for their ſins, yet it ſhould not be long ere he would call them to an account, and deſtroy them for all their wickedneſs. <hi>O Aſſyrian;</hi> it is in the Hebrew <hi>O Aſhur;</hi> for ſo it ſeems
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42788:69"/>
the land of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> or the Inhabitants thereof, were called, either from <hi>Aſhur,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Shem,</hi> Gen. 10.22. as it is moſt genera'ly thought, or from one of the poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> of the ſame name. See the Notes <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.8. And hereby in this place is meant the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to wit, <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> (together with his army) as appears plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Are not my Princes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Kings?</hi> and in many other ſuch like paſſages. As for this expreſſion, <hi>O Aſſyrian the rod of mine anger,</hi> either it may be taken, as ſpoken by God in a way of calling the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to come and deſtroy the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raelites,</hi> according to the Commiſſion which God in his anger againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> had given him; or elſe as in a way of lamenting the ſad miſeries that were coming upon his people, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould be uſed as his rod to puniſh them for their ſins: which is alſo repeated in the following words, <hi>and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation.</hi> The meaning whereof ſeems to be, That as the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were Gods <hi>Rod</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his people, ſo <hi>the ſtaff in their hand,</hi> the weapons wherewith they came armed, and all the power which they had wherewith to fight againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were but the Inſtruments of Gods Indignation for the puniſhing of the people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we read the firſt words, as they are in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>Wo to the Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger;</hi> then the next clauſe may be read alſo, as it is there rendred, <hi>though the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation.</hi> And then the drift of this clauſe, muſt be to imply, that though God in his juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would make uſe of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> for the puniſhing of his people; yet woful deſtruction would at laſt come upon the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> for all that; ſo that this is clearly added for the comfort of Gods people, to whom the very name of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> muſt needs be dreadful, becauſe of ſome incurſions they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made into the land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, againſt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that do continually and without ceaſing provoke me to wrath againſt them, and againſt whom therefore I am highly offended, and have determined to pour forth my wrath, upon them; yea, this expreſſion, <hi>the people of my wrath,</hi> may ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that there was nothing in them, but what might juſtly ſtir up Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, <hi>to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey,</hi> &amp;c. which is fully an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of what was ſignified by that Prophetick name given lately to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Son, <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> for which ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, That he is imployed by me, as the <hi>Rod of mine anger,</hi> or that he is ſent by me to puniſh the wickedneſs of my people; no ſuch thought will ever come into his heart. All that he will mind, will be the ſatisfying of his cruel and ambitious deſires, by conquering Kingdoms, and deſtroying the people. As for that which may be objected, how then did <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> ſay to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Am I now come up without the Lord againſt this place to deſtroy it? the Lord ſaid to me, Go up againſt this land, and deſtroy it;</hi> ſee how this may be anſwered in the Note there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For he ſaith, Are not my Princes altogether Kings?</hi> That is, Are not my Nobles and Princes, that attend upon me, every way equal to Kings in riches, glory, ſtate and power? Or, Are not the ſeveral King that I have ſubdued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42788:70"/>
my Princes, holding me as their Soveraign, and ſerving under my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? And thus from the pride of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the confidence he had in his own greatneſs and power, the Prophet proves what he had ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, that he minded not God in his expedition againſt the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but went forth meerly in the proud confidence he had of his own unreſiſtible power.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Is not Calno as Carchemiſh? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damaſcus?]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Have not I, my Father and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, ſubdued all theſe ſtrong Cities and Provinces, as well the one as the other? When any one of them ſtood out againſt us, were they not brought under our power, as the other before had been? And thus from his prevailing over theſe, he intends to infer, that he ſhould certainly prevail over others whom he had not yet ſubdued, and particularly over <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.34. we find a like vaunting ſpeech uttered by <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> wherein ſome of the places here named, are alſo mentioned. And becauſe that, and divers other of the vaunting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpeeches of his there recorded, are ſo like to theſe wherewith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth here ſet forth the blaſphemous pride and ſelf-confidence of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> it ſeems moſt probable that it is that Invaſion of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> that is here pointed at. Becauſe <hi>Calno,</hi> or <hi>Calneh,</hi> Amos 6.2. is ſaid to have been in the land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> Gen. 10.10. and <hi>Carchemiſh</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be a City lying by <hi>Euphrates,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.20. therefore it is thought the moſt of the places here named were in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>As my hand hath found the Kingdoms of the Idols,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As I have ſubdued and gotten to my ſelf by my great power ſeveral Kingdoms that were under the patronage and protection of their ſeveral Gods, <hi>and whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images did excel them of Jeruſalem and Samaria;</hi> that is, were mightier Gods than theirs. But for the better underſtanding of this paſſage, we muſt know, 1. That to ſet forth how eaſily he ſubdued theſe Kingdoms, he uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>As my hand hath found the Kingdoms of the Idols;</hi> he found it no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der work to take theſe Kingdoms, than it is for a man to take up a birds-neſt that he finds in his way, as he doth afterwards expreſs himſelf, ver. 14. 2ly. That his intention was blaſphemouſly to inſult, not only over the Nations whom he had vanquiſhed, and alſo over their Gods, whom he alſo eſteemed Gods not able to defend their people, purpoſely that he might in like manner reproach the God of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on whoſe aid he knew <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his people did with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence rely; for agreable hereto were theſe blaſphemous vauntings of <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> 2 King. 18.33, 34, 35. and 19.12. 3ly. That he calls their gods <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Graven-Images,</hi> either becauſe it was the conſtant courſe of the heathens to worſhip their gods in and before Idols and graven Images; or elſe as by way of contempt, as not accounting their gods worthy the name of gods in compariſon of their great God <hi>Nizrech,</hi> 2 King. 19.37. that had advanced the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire to ſuch a mighty height. 4ly. That the reaſon why he doth ſo peremptorily aver, that <hi>the graven Images</hi> of the Kingdoms whom he had vanquiſhed <hi>did excel them of Jeruſalem and of Samaria,</hi> was becauſe they judged of the greatneſe and power of their Gods, according to the multitude and greatneſs, the riches and proſperity, the ſucceſs and victories of the people that worſhipped them: and it may be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42788:70"/>
to according to the multitude of Sacrifices that were offered them, and the Pomp and Solemnity uſed in their Worſhip. And obſervable alſo it is herein, with what horrid Blaſphemy, by preferring thoſe Idols before the God of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this Miſcreant makes thr true God leſs than nothing; for <hi>an Idol is nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4, 5. That the words of this Verſe are an abrupt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect kind of ſpeech, <hi>As my hand hath found the Kingdoms of the Idols, and whoſe graven Images did excel them of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Samaria; as if he had ſaid, ſo ſhall my hand alſo much more find and ſubdue <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> too, as is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her Idols, ſo do to Jeruſalem and her Idols?] Hezekiah</hi> had demoliſhed all the Idols in <hi>Judah,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> went up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but this Heatheniſh King after his manner ſpeaks no otherwiſe of the true God, the God of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> than of the Idols of other Nations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount</hi> Zion <hi>and on</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> To wit, his Church and People; and ſee alſo the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.27. When the Lord hath fully done by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> what he means to do, by way of taking vengeance on his People for their wickedneſs, (for that is <hi>his work,</hi> as he is the juſt Judg of the world) and by way of Fatherly Correction, for the humbling, purging and reforming his choſen ones; when he hath ſufficiently quieted them under his hand, and brought them home by Repentance unto himſelf; then, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria;</hi> that is, his blaſphemous and reproachful ſpeeches uttered againſt God, and againſt his Servants, his proud vaunting ſpeeches concerning himſelf, and all his hard and cruel uſage of God's people. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>I will viſit upon the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria;</hi> an Expreſſion uſed with reſpect to God's forbearing, and not ſeeming to mind the wickedneſs of a people for a time, when yet afterward he appears againſt them to puniſh them; as likewilſe to imply, that God never puniſhes or corrects without a due cognizance of the Cauſe and Crime; ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.5. As for the laſt words, <hi>And the glory of his high looks,</hi> thereby is meant all the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> did proudly and contemptuouſly againſt God and his people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>For he ſaith, By the ſtrength of my hand I have done it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, By my great Power, by the multitude and ſtrength of my Armies, <hi>and by my wiſdom, for I am prudent;</hi> that is, by my Craft and Policy, in ſowing Diſcords amongſt Nations, in raiſing occaſions amongſt them for my invading of them, and other ſuch-like State-ſtratagems, and by my wiſe managing of all my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns when I did invade them: <hi>And I have removed the bounds of the people,</hi> to wit, by bringing them all as one people under my Dominion, and diſtributing them under the Government of my Viceroys after what manner I pleaſed: <hi>and have robbed their treaſures,</hi> that is, their ſecreteſt ſtores and treaſures, whether publick or private; <hi>and I have put down the Inhabitants like a valiant man,</hi> that is, like a man of extraordinary courage and ſtrength, I have deſtroyed the Inhabitants, though never ſo many, and never ſo ſtrongly fortified.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And my hand hath found as a neſt the riches of the people,</hi> &amp;c.] That
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42788:71"/>
is, I have as eaſily ſeized upon <hi>the riches of the people,</hi> in the ſeveral places that have been ſubdued by me, as a man may take eggs out of a Birds neſt, where all the labour indeed is in finding the Neſt; when a man hath once found it, he may eaſily put in his hand and take the eggs away with him: which is more fully expreſſed in the following words; <hi>and as one gathereth eggs that are left,</hi> to wit, the Dam not being there, or flying away for fear; <hi>have I gathered all the earth;</hi> that is, even with as much eaſe have I gathered together, and taken to my ſelf the wealth of the whole world; and ſo he ſpeaks in a proud vaunting manner: becauſe he had conquered the greateſt part of the Earth then known, and brought it under his Dominion. Some I know in this Phraſe, of his gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all the Earth,</hi> would have his carrying away the Inhabitants of the Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as well as his ſurpriſing of their Treaſures. But I conceive that is not here, at leaſt principally, intended. And with how little difficulty he did this, is farther ſet forth in the following words, wherein proceeding ſtill in the ſame Similitude, he adds, <hi>And there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</hi> Birds when they are in their Neſts, will ſometimes in defence of their eggs ſtrike with their wings, or peck with their bills, or make ſome kind of peeping noiſe, out of a kind of diſcontent againſt thoſe that diſturb them; or elſe they will fly about, and with ſome chattering or crying Note will expreſs their anger againſt thoſe that rob them. And therefore to expreſs how eaſily he took away the wealth of thoſe places where he prevailed, he compares himſelf to one that takes away the eggs out of a birds neſt, where there is no bird in the leaſt to ſtir againſt him; <hi>there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped;</hi> that is, there was none that durſt in a manner make any reſiſtance againſt him. Such a terror fell upon them, that they ſcarce durſt lift up a hand, or mutter againſt me, or ſo much as expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the matter with me, or complain or cry to others for help.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Shall the Ax boaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] This is inſerted by the Prophet by way of diſcovering the abſurdity of the fore-recited vauntings of the Aſſyrian: <hi>Shall the ax boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith? Or ſhall the ſaw magnifie it ſelf againſt him that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>keth it?</hi> That is, when the workman hath made a piece of work, ſhall the ax or ſaw, which he made uſe of, glory and vaunt, that it was they which made the work, and not the Artificer that made uſe of them? That were againſt all reaſon. It were abſurd enough, if an Ax or Saw of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter metal, and ſharper than another, ſhould advance it ſelf againſt one that were blunter and of a worſe metal; and that becauſe it is not from it ſelf, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the pleaſure of him that made them, that they are better or ſharper than others; but much more abſurd it would be, if they ſhould advance themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that made uſe of them. And every way as abſurd it was for the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to advance himſelf againſt God, that made uſe of him for the hewing, and wounding, and cutting down the Nations, conſidering that he had all the Power he had from God; neither could he have done any thing againſt them, had not God been pleaſed to make uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im herein. And to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>As if the rod ſhould ſhake it ſelf againſt them that lift it up; or as if the ſtaff ſhould lift up it ſelf, as if it were no wood;</hi> that is, as it were abſurd for a rod or ſtaff to advance themſelves againſt the man that ſhould ſmite with them, ſaying, It was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42788:71"/>
we that gave the ſtrokes, and not you; ſo forgetting, as it were, that they are but pieces of dead wood, no way able of themſelves to ſtir or move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; even ſo abſurd and ridiculous it was in the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> who was raiſed up by God, and inabled by him to do what he did, to exalt himſelf againſt God, and to aſcribe all that he did to himſelf; ſo forgetting what a poor contemptible creature he was in himſelf, unable to have done any thing, had not God been pleaſed to make uſe of him as a rod and a ſtaff, to ſcourge and beat his people. This laſt clauſe may be read, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>As if a rod ſhould ſhake them that lift it up, or as if the ſtaff ſhould lift up that which is not wood;</hi> which implies the very ſame thing, that as it is againſt all ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that a rod or ſtaff ſhould have power over a living man, that is not a dead piece of wood, as that is; ſo it was a moſt unreaſonable thing for the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to exalt himſelf againſt God. But the Tranſlation which is in our Bibles is (I think) clearly the beſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Therefore ſhall the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, ſend among his fat ones lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Becauſe of this proud and blaſphemous boaſting of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> againſt the Lord, and becauſe of his rage and cruelty againſt his people, God will pull down his great ſtrength and power, in the confidence whereof he doth thus arrogantly exalt himſelf. In denouncing this judgment, he gives God the title, <hi>The Lord, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> by way of oppoſing the Lords Almighty Power to the weakneſs and pride of the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> and the hoſts which God hath under his command both in Heaven and Earth, to <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, which he deemed ſo invincible: and the Judgment intended is the dreadful deſtruction that was brought upon the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, whilſt it lay before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by one of the Lord's Heavenly Hoſt. As for this Figurative expreſſion wherewith their deſtruction is ſet forth, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend among his fat ones leanneſs;</hi> either that ſlaughter is meant that was made amongſt the Princes and great Commanders of his Army, of whom he had boaſted before, ver. 8. (for which ſee the Note 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.35. and what is noted upon the like expreſſions, <hi>Job</hi> 15.27. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.29.) Or more generally, that the vaſt and huge body of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army ſhould by the ſlaughter of ſo many thouſands be ſuddenly conſumed and brought down to a very poor and thin company. A Similitude therefore the fitter, becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in his exalting himſelf againſt God, is thereby co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly compared to ſome fat pamper'd horſe, that will not be under command, but kicks and flings, and at laſt caſts off the man that rides him. See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. And then in the following words the ſame judgment is ſet forth under another Similitude, <hi>And under his glory he ſhall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire;</hi> whereby is meant, that his glorious and victorious Army, whereof he vaunted ſo greatly, and for which he was ſo glorious and dreadful amongſt all the Nations round about, ſhould be ſuddenly and utterly conſumed, even as ſo much wood would inſtantly be burnt up by a fire that ſhould be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled under it. And herein it may well be there is an Alluſion either to that Cuſtome which was uſed in thoſe times, of burning the dead bodies of men upon piles of wood, whereon they were laid; or elſe to the manner of that miraculous deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib's</hi> Army, which ſome ſay was done by a burning Peſtilence, and others by ſome ſtrange kind of blaſting, ſuch as was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42788:72"/>
that of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Levit. 10.2. and that of the Iſraelites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.1. But ſee the Note above, Chap. 9.5. and likewiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.9. and 83.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the light of Iſrael ſhall be for a fire,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The God of Iſrael who is uſually the enlightner and comforter of his people, both by chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them up in their afflictions, and by delivering them out of the darkneſs of their tribulations, as he was to the Jews at that time of their great diſtreſs, when they were beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, (the Prophet alludes to what he had ſaid before, Chap. 9.2. for which ſee the Note there) ſhall be as a fire to burn up their enemies, <hi>and his holy One for a flame;</hi> See the Note, Chap. 1.4. The meaning is, that the holy God, who had ſanctified <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would manifeſt himſelf to be ſuch, both by defending them and deſtroying their enemies; <hi>And it ſhall burn and devour his thorns and his briers;</hi> that is, the Souldiers of his Army, that as briers and thorns had ſorely galled and diſtreſſed God's people, <hi>in one day,</hi> that is altogether at one and the ſame time; the Army that was ſo long a time-gathering and forming, ſhould be all ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And indeed though this were done in the night, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. yet it might be properly enough ſaid to have been done <hi>in one day;</hi> becauſe the night is a part of the natural day. Some would have <hi>the briers and thorns</hi> to be meant of the meaner ſort of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army. But I conceive that this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction of all ſorts amongſt them, great and ſmall, may rather be thought to be ſet forth in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And ſhall conſume the glory of his foreſt, and of his fruitful field,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Bravery and Pride of his glorious Army, (See the Note before, verſ. 16.) which by reaſon of the multitude of the Soldiers therein, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spears and Launces wherewith they were armed, ſeemed to reſemble ſome mighty foreſt, full of all ſorts of trees, as thick as they can ſtand one by another; or ſome rich field, wherein the ears of corn do lift up their heads as cloſe as they can poſſibly grow together: This ſeems to be the plain meaning of this <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Expreſſion. Yet it may alſo well be, which ſome think, that by <hi>the glory of his foreſt</hi> may be meant the great ones, his Princes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Army, that were as ſo many lofty and ſtately trees; and by <hi>the fruitful field,</hi> the meaner and inferior body of his Soldiery: Or elſe, that his Camp being of a very large extent, that part of his Army that lay encamped in the higher and more eminent places, is compared to the high trees of a Foreſt; and that part that lay in the plains and lower grounds, is compared to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>corn in the Valleys. The greateſt difficulty is in the following words, <hi>Both Soul and Body,</hi> which is in the Hebrew, <hi>From the Soul, and even to the fleſh:</hi> And therefore it is ſo many ſeveral ways expounded; As 1. that the vengeance of God ſhould fall not upon their Bodies only, but upon their Souls too. Or 2. that both man and beaſt ſhould be deſtroyed. Or 3. that not only the Soul ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſmitten, and the Life taken away, but alſo their Bodies ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and conſumed. Or 4. that by ſmiting their Bodies, they ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their Souls, their Lives, and ſo they ſhould be utterly deſtroyed. Before they were threatned with a conſumption or <hi>leanneſs,</hi> verſ. 16. which might be without loſs of Life: but here it is expreſſed that they ſhould be ſlain and utterly deſtroyed, even as fire by burning the body doth take away the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42788:72"/>
Life. Or 5. that the Commanders and Captains, who were as the Soul and Spirit of that vaſt body of their Army, ſhould be cut off; and withal the body, that was enlivened, as it were, and governed by the Soul, ſhould be deſtroyed. And theſe two laſt indeed I judge may moſt probably be here intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſhall be as when a Standard-bearer fainteth.]</hi> That is, As when a Standard-bearers heart melteth away, becauſe he ſees his Souldiers forſake their Colours, and thereupon he flies with the reſt, and ſo the Standard is taken; or as when a Standard-bearer faints, and falls and dies, the whole Army is uſually then diſcouraged and routed; ſo it ſhall be with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, upon this miraculous havock that ſhall by an Angel be made amongſt them, they ſhall be all diſmayed, and irrecoverably diſordered and forced to fly. But yet ſome do particularly apply this to the fainting and flight of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> their King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.36, 37. and the terror that fell upon the Nations under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, upon his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And the reſt of the trees of his foreſt ſhall be few, that a Child may write them.]</hi> That is, of the Soldiers of that numberleſs Army, there ſhall be but a very few left alive. Some ſhall eſcape, that they may report in their own Country what the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done to them; but they ſhall be but a poor ſmall number. In this expreſſion, <hi>A child may write them,</hi> there ſeems to be an Alluſion to the enrolling and liſting of the names of the Soldiers by the Muſter-maſters, or Clerks of their bands; and ſo it is all one in effect, as if the Prophet ſaid, that there would be no need of any ſuch Officer to keep a Roll of them; even a Child would be ſufficient to take an account of them. And indeed obſervable herein it is what was the iſſue of the proud boaſting of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh,</hi> 2 King. 18.23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when the Lord hath finiſhed his whole work upon his people, and hath puniſhed the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> by whom he was pleaſed to correct them, <hi>That the remnant of Iſrael, and ſuch as are eſcaped of the houſe of Jacob,</hi> that is, the remnant that ſhall eſcape and not be deſtroyed in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Invaſion, <hi>ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them,</hi> that is, the Aſſyrian, <hi>but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> See the Note, Chap. 1.4. <hi>In truth,</hi> that is, ſincerely, not hypocritically, as they had formerly done, when they made an outward profeſſion indeed of truſting in God, but did rely wholly upon the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> The meaning is, that when the remnant that were eſcaped had experimentally found the ſad fruit of their own folly, in calling in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to their help, and in reſting upon him with ſo much confidence, in that he had proved a ſcourge to them inſtead of an help, and God had made them ſorely to ſmart for it; and when by God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> they had learnt what a reed the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was to be leaned upon, and how Almighty and Merciful the Lord was, this ſhould make them reſolve never more to ſtay themſelves upon the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or any ſuch as they were, but wholly and ſolely to rely upon the Lord.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>The remnant ſhall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.]</hi> To wit, of whoſe infinite Power they ſhould have clear experience by that Deſtruction which God would bring upon the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, and the Deliverance which thereby ſhould be wrought for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which they had ſtraitly beſieged.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42788:73"/>
It is as if the Prophet had ſaid, And indeed ſo it ſhall be; that which I foretold by the Prophetick name of my Son <hi>Shear-jaſhah,</hi> which is, being interpreted, <hi>The remnant ſhall return,</hi> (concerning which ſee the Note, Chap. 7.3.) ſhall certainly come to paſs; a remnant ſhall eſcape, that ſhall not only come back to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their abode, from whence they had been driven by the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> but alſo return to God by unfeigned Repentance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>For though thy people Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, yet a remnant of them ſhall return.]</hi> That is, only a ſmall remnant of them ſhall eſcape, and by Repentance return to the Lord their God. If we read theſe words, as if Iſrael were ſpoken to in the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as they are expreſſed in our Bibles, they ſeem rather the words of God to the Prophet, <hi>For though thy people Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, yet a remnant of them ſhall return.</hi> And indeed when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had not only carried away the ten Tribes of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into Captivity, but alſo had ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the number of the other Tribes that were of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> by the havock he hade made amongſt them in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> this was then clearly accompliſhed concerning <hi>a remnant</hi> only that ſhould be preſerved. And becauſe this was a clear Type of thoſe few of the Jewiſh Nation that were in the Apoſtles time converted to the Faith of the Goſpel, therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of that, as an accompliſhment of that which the Prophet here ſaith, Rom. 9.27. <hi>Eſaias alſo crieth concerning Iſrael, Though the number of the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, a remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The conſumption decreed ſhall overflow with righteouſneſs.]</hi> Or, <hi>in righteouſneſs,</hi> as it is in the Margin. The meaning is, that the deſtruction wherewith God had determined to conſume and waſte the Jews, ſhould as a mighty floud (ſee the Notes before, Chap. 8.7, 8.) overflow the Land, and thereby ſweep away the Inhabitants, to wit, ſo far as God had withal decreed it ſhould go; and that this ſhould be done <hi>with righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>in righteouſneſs,</hi> in that hereby he ſhould proceed with great Juſtice and Righteouſneſs for the puniſhing of the wickedneſs of his people, and withal approve himſelf faithful and juſt in reſerving a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the Promiſe he had formerly made for the preſervation of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the raiſing of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> out of his ſtock. This I conceive is the clear meaning of this clauſe; and that this is purpoſely added, to ſhew why he had ſaid in the foregoing words, that only a remnant of them ſhould return. But yet many others hold, that by <hi>the conſumption decreed</hi> is meant that little remnant that ſhould be left of the people thus waſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and that it is ſaid that this <hi>conſumption decreed</hi> ſhould <hi>overflow with righteouſneſs;</hi> becauſe this remnant being reclaimed and refined by their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould abound in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; which they ſay was partly fulfilled in the remnant that returned unto the Lord in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days, when God had ſo miraculouſly delivered <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army; but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42788:73"/>
moſt remarkably in that eminent Grace that was ſo conſpicuous in that remnant of the Jews that embraced the Faith of Chriſt, the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians of the Primitive Church. Yea others would extend this further, namely, that this ſmall remnant left of <hi>the conſumption decreed,</hi> ſhould cauſe Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to overflow the whole world, to wit, by their ſpreading of the Goſpel amongſt all Nations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>For the Lord God of Hoſts ſhall make a conſumption, even determined, in the midſt of all the Land.]</hi> That the Jews might not ſlight all the Prophet had ſpoken, either in the confidence of their own ſtrength, or as pretending it to be incredible, that God ſhould bring ſuch a conſumption and deſtruction upon his people, to whom he had made ſo many gracious Promiſes, and with whom he had made an everlaſting Covenant; the Prophet doth here yet once again aſſure them, that ſo it ſhould be; the Lord, even <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring this deſolation upon them, even <hi>in the midſt of all the Land,</hi> that is, all the Land over; or, even in the heart and inmoſt places of the Land. Where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cites ſome part of the foregoing verſe, to prove that there would be only a remnant of the Jews converted and ſaved; he adds alſo the words of this verſe, but according to the Tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> Rom. 9.28. <hi>For he will finiſh the work, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs; becauſe a ſhort work will the Lord make upon the earth:</hi> wherein though the words ſeem to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from theſe here, which are rendred according to the Hebrew; yet the ſenſe is the ſame, the drift of the Apoſtle being thereby to ſhew, that what the Prophet did of old foretel, ſhould be fulfilled in thoſe times; becauſe God had propoſed to make a ſhort work of the buſineſs, even ſpeedily and within a ſhort time, to cut off in a manner the whole Nation of the Jews, to wit, by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and ſo then likewiſe only a remnant ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, ver. 16. Becauſe the Prophet had ſpoken of ſuch an univerſal conſumption that ſhould be amongſt the people of the Land, leſt the faithful amongſt them ſhould be overmuch diſheartned and diſcouraged thereby, he now by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God chears up them; and becauſe the immediate ſtorm that was coming, and was moſt likely to be dreadful to them, was the Siege of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> therefore he addreſſes his Speech particularly to the Inhabitants of that City, together with thoſe that had fled thither for refuge, <hi>O my my people that dwelleſt in Zion, be not afraid of the Aſſyrian,</hi> that is, be not extremely terrified when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall come to invade you and beſiege you, becauſe of this which I have ſaid; to which purpoſe obſervable it is, that in theſe words he owns them ſtill as his people, and hints to them the tender reſpect he had to <hi>Zion;</hi> which he had choſen to be his dwelling-place; <hi>He ſhall ſmite thee with a rod, and ſhall lift up a ſtaff againſt thee after the manner of</hi> Egypt. This hath reſpect to that which he had ſaid before, verſ. 5. <hi>O Aſſyrian the rod of mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. for which ſee the Notes there: And the meaning is, that as formerly God ſuffered the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to oppreſs them ſorely, but did not ſuffer them to deſtroy them, or to keep them in perpetual bondage, but did at laſt deſtroy <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and deliver them; ſo it ſhould be with the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> God would uſe him as a rod to ſcourge his people, and as a ſtaff to beat them, but not as a Sword to ſlay them; he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42788:74"/>
ſhould not be able utterly to ruine them as he intended; but God would at laſt ſeaſonably deliver them, and deſtroy <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> as he did <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And ſo likewiſe under this might be implyed, that at the near approaching Invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> they ſhould not take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (he ſhould only lift up his ſtaff againſt them, and threaten them ſorely, as it is ſaid afterwards, ver. 32. <hi>He ſhall ſhake his hand againſt the mount of the daughter of Zion</hi>) and that they ſhould not carry away the people into Captivity, as they had carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But now if we read this paſſage according to the Tranſlation that is ſet in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>He ſhall ſmite thee with a rod, but he ſhall lift up his ſtaff for thee after the manner of</hi> Egypt; then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt needs be clearly this, that though God would ſharply chaſtiſe them by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> his rod, as he did their Forefathers by <hi>Pharoah,</hi> yet as then by the lifting up of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod upon the Red-Sea, he did ſave their Fathers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his mighty Army, ſo he would now <hi>lift up his ſtaff</hi> for the defence of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and his people, when they ſhould ſeem to be in as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate danger, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in at the Red-Sea; they ſhould only ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of God; the Lord of Hoſts himſelf would lift up a ſtaff for the ſecuring of them, and for the utter deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and his terrible Army.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>For yet a very little while, and the indignation ſhall ceaſe, and mine anger in their deſtruction.]</hi> That is, It ſhall be but a very little while before I will utterly deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſo in his deſtruction there ſhall be an end of mine anger and indignation againſt mine own people. But now becauſe there was not an end of God's anger againſt the Jews, upon the deſtruction of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi>'s Army, therefore ſome would extend <hi>this very little while,</hi> to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Jews out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But I conceive there is no neceſſity of that. Upon the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army God did no more for a time afflict the Jews by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and this may be all that is intended in this Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note before, ver. 16. Theſe words may be taken either as the words of God, ſpeaking of himſelf in a third perſon; or elſe rather as the words of the Prophet. <hi>And the Lord of Hoſts ſhall ſtir up a ſcourge for him,</hi> that is for the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> As if he had ſaid, When God hath chaſtiſed his people by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> as a Father corrects his Child with a rod, he ſhall bring a ſorer judgment upon the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> beating them with a ſcourge, as a Maſter doth his Slave; <hi>according to the ſlaughter of Midian,</hi> that is, ſuddenly, even in one night, by the immediate hand of God, without the loſs of any one of God's people.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42788:74"/>
from that perpetual bondage under which <hi>Sennacherib</hi> intended to bring them, by Gods miraculous deſtroying of his mighty Army, wherewith he went up to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 1. Becauſe the drift of the Prophet here, ſeems to be the comforting of Gods faithful Servants againſt the terrors of the near approaching invaſion; and 2ly, becauſe in the following verſes there ſeems to be a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> going up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to ſhake off this yoke by refuſing to pay the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> his tribute; yet it was not done till God deſtroyed <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army. <hi>And the yoke ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> (that is, not only taken off and broken for the time, but alſo ſo marred and ſpoiled, that thou ſhalt be no more afflicted therewith, as thou haſt been) <hi>becauſe of the anointing,</hi> that is, becauſe of Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah, Gods anointed; ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. and 45.7. and 132.17. Or becauſe of the eternal Kingdom promiſed to <hi>Davids</hi> poſterity in Chriſt, whereof the anointing of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> was a type. So that hereby is implied, both that God would preſerve the Royal ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> with reſpect to the accompliſhment of his promiſe for the ſpringing up of the Meſſiah from thence (and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this may be comprehended his reſpect to holy <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in deſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army upon his Prayer) and likewiſe that God would deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the ſake of his annointed, the Lord Chriſt. And thus way is made, as ſome conceive, to that glorious Prophecy concerning Chriſt, which is inſerted in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>He is come to Aiath,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> mentioned before, ver. 24. Here the Prophet begins to deſcribe the march of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> with his Army (to wit, the head-quarters of his Army, where himſelf was preſent; for his Army was no doubt ſpread abroad all the Countrey over) how he paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from one place to another; and what Cities he took and plundred one after another by the way, as he went up to beſige <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And that which was deſigned hereby, was, That when all things came exactly to paſs, as is here foretold, the faithful might be aſſured hereby that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not a foot, but according to the foreknowledge, and fore-appointment of God; and that therefore their deliverance foretold likewiſe by the Prophet, would be exactly accompliſhed, as this was; yea, and withall, the manner how the Prophet relates this is obſervable, to wit, as if he had ſeen all this done in a Prophetical rapture or viſion; or as if he were telling the rumours that were every where in the affrighted peoples mouths, concerning the raging and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army; <hi>He is come to Aiath,</hi> or <hi>Ai,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.2. <hi>He is paſſed to Migron,</hi> ſee the Note 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.21. <hi>at Michmaſh he hath layed up his carriages;</hi> a place not far from <hi>Migron</hi> and <hi>Gibeah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.2. and 14.5. and it is probable, that there he left his carriages, wherein he had his train of Artillery, and all kind of luggage and proviſion for his Army, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely that he might march with the more ſpeed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and becauſe he looked upon that as a convenient place where he might lodge them ſafely under the cuſtody of ſome few of his forces, and ſupply his Army from thence as occaſion did require. Yet ſome would have it, that he did it out of confidence, That he ſhould preſently take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo ſhould then return thither again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42788:75"/>Ver. 29. <hi>They are gone over the paſſage,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Having left his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages at <hi>Michmaſh,</hi> as is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, he with his Army went over that ſtrait, rocky and difficult paſſage between the Mountains, which in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.23. is called <hi>The paſſage of</hi> Michmaſh, concerning which ſee alſo the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.4. <hi>They have taken up their lodgings at Geba,</hi> which I take alſo to be the ſame that is called alſo <hi>Gibeah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.5. becauſe the paſſage there ſpoken of is ſaid to lye between <hi>Michmaſh</hi> and <hi>Gibeah.</hi> But however, there was a <hi>Geba</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> (in whoſe lot all the reſt of the Cities here mentioned were) as we may ſee in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21.17. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 11.31. And the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is here made of <hi>their lodging at</hi> Geba, may ſeem to be to imply, that the hard labour they had undergone in getting thorough <hi>the paſſage at Michmaſh,</hi> made them glad to ſtay a while to refreſh themſelves at <hi>Geba,</hi> or <hi>Gibeah;</hi> and yet that withal they were ſo eager to paſs on to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they lodged there but one night, and then preſently away they went. <hi>Ramah is afraid,</hi> as being near to <hi>Geba. Gibeah of Saul is fled;</hi> that is, the Inhabitants of that <hi>Gibeah</hi> where <hi>Saul</hi> of old dwelt: See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26. and 11.4. And this I coneive is alſo added to ſhew how eaſily <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſhould take theſe places, when the rumour of his approach ſhould ſtrike the Inhabitants with ſuch a terror, that multitudes of them ſhould immediately fly away to ſave their lives.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 25.44. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.21. The meaning is, that there ſhould be a grievous outcry amongſt the Inhabitants in that City, upon the breaking in of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> upon them; and the ſame is intended in that which is added concerning <hi>Anathoth,</hi> one of the Towns in the Land of <hi>Benjamin</hi> that were given to the Prieſts, where the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was born and had his abode, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Cauſe it to be heard unto Laiſh, O poor Anathoth.</hi> That is, Do thou alſo, O poor <hi>Anathoth,</hi> lift up thy voice ſo, that it may be heard unto the utmoſt borders of the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (which is an Hyperbolical expreſſion, to ſet forth the extremity of her miſery, with reſpect whereto alſo he calls the Town, <hi>poor Anathoth.</hi>) For that <hi>Laiſh</hi> was in the utmoſt North-parts of <hi>Canaan</hi> nigh unto <hi>Zidon,</hi> ſee <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.47. and <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>Madmenah is removed,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Inhabitants of <hi>Madmenah</hi> (which was a City in <hi>Judah,</hi> Joſh. 15.31.) are fled and gone. See the Note above, ver. 29. yet ſome conceive there is an Hyperbole in the expreſſion the Prophet here uſeth; as if he had ſaid, That <hi>Madmenah</hi> was ſo ſhaken, as if it would have removed to ſome other place; Or, that the terrified Inhabitants were in ſuch a tumult, as if they would have carried the City away with them; <hi>the Inhabitants of Gebim gather themſelves to flee,</hi> that is, every man being afraid to flee apart by himſelf, they gather themſelves together to flee in companies, that they might the better defend themſelves, if they ſhould meet with any ſtragling Soldiers of the enemy by the way.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>As yet ſhall he remain at Nob that day,</hi> &amp;c.] According to our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the meaning of theſe words ſeems to be this, That though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> with his Army got as far as <hi>Nob</hi> (a City of the Prieſts in the Tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> ſee the Note 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.) <hi>that day</hi> that he marched from <hi>Geba,</hi> where he lodged for a night, ver. 29. yea, as the words ſeem to import, ſome good

And now all this concerning the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> carrying all this as a torrent before him, is thus ſet forth, purpoſely to ſhew, That it was meerly by the mighty hand of God, that the Jews were afterwards delivered from him. And indeed as much is covertly intimated in that which is ſaid here of his ſhaking of his hand againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for this implieth, That this was all he ſhould be able to do to her. He might ſtraiten and affright her, but ſhe ſhould never come to aſſault her. And therefore, as in oppoſition to this ſhaking of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> hand againſt her, it was afterwards promiſed, That in a way of ſcorn and deriſion ſhe ſhould ſhake her head at him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>Behold the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above ver. 16. Many learned Expoſitors hold, That here the Prophet proceeds to ſhew in this and the following verſe, what havock the Lord would make by this victorious Army of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> amongſt the Jews, both high and low, rich and poor. And the principal reaſon that induced them to think that this paſſage was thus to be underſtood, was, becauſe the mention that is made in the following verſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But theſe Objections may be eaſily anſwered. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeems it to me probable, That the Prophet ſhould thus largely ſet forth, as he hath in the foregoing verſes, how the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army ſhould over-run all without any oppoſition, till he came to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet then ſhould add nothing concerning the miraculous deſtruction of his Army there. And therefore I rather underſtand both theſe verſes, of the hewing down of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> Army. <hi>Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts ſhall lop the boughs with terror;</hi> as if he had ſaid, When the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is thus gotten to the very walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> behold ſuddenly and unexpectedly, and in a manner that ſhall bring great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and affrightment with it, God ſhall hew down this ſtrong and mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or, the ſtrong and mighty ones of this Army: <hi>and the high ones of ſtature ſhall be hewn down, and the haughty ſhall be humbled;</hi> that is, his Princes and Commanders ſhall be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And he ſhall cut down,</hi> &amp;c.] As before the Prophet had compared the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army to the burning of a Wood or Foreſt, (ſee the Notes above ver. 17, 18.) ſo here he compares it to the hewing down of a Foreſt; <hi>And he ſhall cut down the thickets of the Foreſts with iron,</hi> that is, the Lord ſhall hew down the main body, the mixed multitude of the common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> numerous Army, made up of many ſeveral Nations, even as a Wood is cut down with Axes and Hatchets; <hi>and Lebanon ſhall fall by a mighty

Here the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is rather intended by the felling of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> as is before ſaid, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42788:76"/>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> Family ſhould be in as low a condition, as it was in the days of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> who was a mean obſcure man, ſee the Note 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. Now of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as the Jews would have it, this cannot be meant; becauſe in his days the Family of <hi>David</hi> was never brought ſo low. And far greater things are here ſpoken of this <hi>branch,</hi> than can with any ſhew of reaſon be applied to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> or any other Ruler of the Jews after their return from the Babylonian Captivity. But now in Jeſus Chriſt this was fully accompliſhed; becauſe by the mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, (who at her Purification brought the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the poorer ſort of people, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24.) and his Foſter-father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to whom ſhe was married, a poor Carpenter, it appears plainly, that the Royal Family of <hi>David,</hi> from whom they both were lineally deſcended, was at that time brought to a very contemptible condition, even like to the dry and dead ſtump of a tree. And accordingly the outward condition of Chriſt, the weak and poor twig that ſprung from this withered ſtub, was very baſe in the eye of the world. But yet we ſee to what a height of Spiritual Glory the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was in Chriſt ſoon advanced by the preaching of the Goſpel. By the laſt clauſe, <hi>and a branch ſhall grow cut of his roots,</hi> the ſame in effect (I conceive) is meant; yet ſome would have it, That by growing <hi>out of his roots,</hi> is meant his being deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> and others the Progenitors of <hi>David,</hi> to whom the Meſſiah was promiſed. And becauſe the Hebrew word here tranſlated a Branch, is <hi>Nezer;</hi> therefore ſome conceive there is an alluſion herein to the City <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where Chriſt uſually dwelt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c.] That, is the Holy Ghoſt, and therewith the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt ſhall take up its perpetual uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted reſidence with him, and in him; which was ſignified at the Baptiſm of Chriſt, when the Holy Ghoſt came down upon Chriſt in the likeneſs of a Dove; and as the Baptiſt ſaid, <hi>it abode upon him,</hi> Joh. 1.32. Indeed we read of the Spirit's reſting upon others, as upon the ſeventy Elders that were choſen to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in the government of the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.25. upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.15. yea, upon all real Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth upon you.</hi> But we muſt know, that the Spirit reſted upon Chriſt in a more ſpecial and ſingular manner than it doth, or ever did upon others. 1. Becauſe <hi>in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. 2ly, Becauſe the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon his human nature in all perfection, both for number and meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. Amongſt men, ſome have ſome gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and others have other gifts; but Chriſt had all that others have, and more than all others have. And again, others have gifts requiſite for the members of the Church, ſome in a greater meaſure, and ſome in a leſs; but now Chriſt had gifts requiſite for the head, proper and peculiar to himſelf. And 3ly, Becauſe the Spirit ſo reſted upon him, even in regard of his perſon, that it was impoſſible it ſhould ever be removed from him. However obſervable it is, how clearly it is hereby implied, That the Kingdom of Chriſt was to be wholly a ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in that the Prophet having in the foregoing verſe ſpoken of his firſt coming into the World, and then undertaking here to ſhew how he ſhould be in his perſon fitted for the diſcharge of the Office of the Meſſiah, he mentions this, as that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42788:77"/>
wherein the whole Power, and Glory, and Majeſty of his Kingdom ſhould conſiſt. That the Spirit of God ſhould in ſo eminent a manner reſt upon him, and that he ſhould be ſo ſuperabundanly furniſhed with ſpiritual gifts, even that he might be as an everlaſting treaſure from whence theſe gifts ſhould be continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to his Church. And accordingly the Prophet does here recite ſome of the choice endowments wherewith he ſhould be fully repleniſhed both for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of his ſpiritual Kingdom, and the conſtant ſupply of his people; <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wiſdom and underſtanding,</hi> whereby men are enabled to underſtand things aright, and to order all things wiſely and prudently; <hi>the Spirit of Counſel and might,</hi> whereby men are inabled to judge rightly in difficult caſes and ſtraits, and courageouſly to undertake and go through with any thing they are called to do or to ſuffer in a juſt cauſe. (See alſo the Notes, Chap. 9.6.) <hi>The Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord;</hi> that is, the power of diſcerning the moſt hidden things, and a reverential fear towards God. But now we muſt know, that under theſe all other the manifold gifts of the Spirit are by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> comprehended; only theſe ſeem to be particularly mentioned, with reſpect to Chriſts Regal Power for judging his people, whereto theſe gifts here named, are principally requiſite.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And ſhall make him of quick underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Spirit of the Lord that ſhall reſt upon him, ſhall make him exceedingly, yea, infallibly ſagacious in diſcovering perſons and things; for the Prophet having in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, ſhown the excellent endowments of the perſon of Chriſt, here he proceeds to ſhew how he ſhould exerciſe theſe his gifts and endowments in the Adminiſtration of his Regal power. It is in the original, <hi>And he ſhall make him ſent or ſmell in the fear of the Lord;</hi> which therefore ſome expound thus: That by reaſon of this his being ſo abundantly anointed with the holy Spirit of God, he ſhould breathe forth nothing but what was ſweetly pious and religious; or that in all his courſes he ſhould ſend forth a ſweet ſent ſuitable to the precious ſavour of his ſpiritual unction. But rather by this figurative expreſſion is only meant that which we have in our Tranſlation, <hi>And ſhall make him of quick underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fear of the Lord.</hi> By the ſmell we diſcover things more ſecret, than thoſe things are which appear to the eye or ear; and likewiſe by the ſmell we diſcover things more eaſily and quickly than any other way; ſo that when it is ſaid, That the Spirit ſhould make Chriſt <hi>ſent or ſmell in the fear of the Lord;</hi> This ſeems to intend, that he ſhould be of a ſharp and quick underſtanding, certainly and preſently to diſcover the truth of things; as in our ordinary ſpeech we uſe to ſay of a man that doth quickly find out a thing, That he hath ſoon ſmelt out the matter. As for that which is added concerning the fear of the Lord, <hi>and ſhall make him of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord,</hi> thereby is ſhown wherein the quickneſs of his underſtanding ſhould be diſcovered, to wit, not in earthly things, which are far beneath his Cognizance; but in the things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to Religion and the fear of God, and in judging of mens perſons, as to the inward frame of their Spirits; that looking into their hearts, he would ſoon diſcover whether they were ſuch as did truly fear the Lord, or ſuch as did not fear God, even when they did hypocritically make the faireſt ſhews of Piety; yea, and ſome would have this alſo farther included in that expreſſion, That he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42788:77"/>
ſhould judge of men in theſe regards according to the fear of God, that is, juſtly and uprightly, acquitting and ſaving thoſe that truly fear God, and judging and condemning thoſe that are void of his fear; <hi>and he ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears;</hi> that is, he ſhall not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with reſpect of perſons, neither ſhall he acquit or condemn any man meerly upon outward appearances, the looks, or geſtures, or words of men, or what is rumoured, reported or affirmed by others, but according to the clear knowledg which he ſhall have of their hearts. Men that have no other way to judge, but according to what they ſee or hear, are often miſtaken in judging. But ſo it could not be with Chriſt, becauſe he ſhould of himſelf know all things, yea, even the thoughts and intentions of mens hearts.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>But with righteouſneſs ſhall he judge the poor,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note before, Chap. 2.4. and likewiſe the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.1, 2. The meaning is, That he ſhould do juſtice to the poor as well as to the rich, though he ſhould not favour them in any unjuſt thing becauſe of their poverty; or, that he ſhould, as a righteous King, rule and govern his people, poor, broken-hearted, ſelf-condemned ſinners, protecting them againſt all their enemies temporal and ſpiritual. And much to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth,</hi> to wit, That he ſhould plead the cauſe of his poor people that were meek and gentle under their ſufferings, rebuking and puniſhing their proud Oppreſſors. Or, that he would correct his own meek ones, but it ſhould be with gentleneſs and moderation, as intending to reform and not to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked.]</hi> This may be underſtood, 1. of the preaching of the Goſpel, (which as it is elſewhere called <hi>the word of his mouth,</hi> Rev. 2.16. and 19.15. ſo here it is called <hi>the rod of his mouth,</hi> and <hi>the breath of his lips,</hi> to wit, that with this word, as with the Scepter of his Kingdom, Chriſt ſhould ſharply ſmite thoſe that dwell on the earth, as with a rod, reproving and convincing them of their ſins with ſuch mighty efficacy, that ſome ſhould thereby be brought to ſubmit themſelves, and ſo his word ſhould be the ſavour of life unto life to them; and others ſhould be mortally wounded, even to deſpair, and ſo the Goſpel ſhould be the ſavour of death unto death to them: And 2ly, of the Almighty Will, the ſovereign ſentence and command of God, to wit, That Chriſt ſhould only with a word of his mouth <hi>ſmite the earth,</hi> that is, wicked earthly-minded men, the enemies of God and his people, and ſhould utterly deſtroy them, as we know it is peculiarly ſaid of Antichriſt, That <hi>the Lord ſhall conſume him with the Spirit of his mouth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And righteouſneſs ſhall be the girdle of his loyns,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe in thoſe times, 1. men did conſtantly uſe girdles to bind their looſe Garments cloſe to their bodies: And 2ly, by binding up their long Garments about their loyns, they were the better fitted and ſtrengthened for the diſpatch of any work or ſervice they undertook: And 3ly, they wore alſo their Girdles as a choice Ornament; and there was a Belt or Girdle that was uſually the ſpecial Ornament of Princes (for all which, ſee the Notes <hi>Job</hi> 12.18.) therefore it is ſaid here, That righteouſneſs ſhould be the Girdle of Chriſts loyns, <hi>and faithfulneſs the Girdle of his reins,</hi> to imply, 1. That he ſhould be conſtantly and eminently fitted and funiſhed with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42788:78"/>
righteouſneſs and faithfulneſs for the execution of the Office which God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him. 2ly, That he ſhould moſt juſtly, faithfully and induſtriouſly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and perfect the work he had undertaken for the Salvation of his people. And 3ly, This ſhould be an honour and glory to him throughout the world. Theſe glorious endowments of Gods Spirit ſhould be to him inſtead of thoſe outward Ornaments that are uſually wore by the great Princes and Potentates of the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>The Wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lyon, and the fatling together,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thoſe men that were before of a proud, fierce, cruel and ſavage diſpoſition, moſt untractable, moſt brutiſh, and ravenous, and ſhameful in the places where they lived, more like Wolves, and Lyons, and Leopards than men, when they ſhall once be ſubdued by the Goſpel and Spirit of Chriſt, and give up their names to him, ſhall become meek and gentle, tame and tractable, ſo that they ſhall live and converſe together in the ſame Church with other poor Chriſtians quietly and harmleſly; and the weakeſt that are, ſhall not need to fear them. Now this is mentioned as one of the ſtrangeſt and moſt glorious effects of the Kingdom and Government of Chriſt, that thereby the moſt wicked and miſchievous men ſhould be changed, as if they were transformed out of beaſts into men; and ſo conſequently to ſhew what wonderful peace and concord there ſhould be in the Church of Chriſt. All which I conceive was chiefly accompliſhed in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a little child ſhall lead them.]</hi> That is, though they were never ſo fierce before, yet being converted and brought into Chriſt, they will become ſo tame and tractable, that it will be an eaſie thing for any body to guide and govern them. Though their Paſtors given them of God to be their guides, be never ſo mean and contemptible in the World (as we know it was eminently ſo with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) yet they ſhall readily and willingly give up themſelves to obey them, and to be ordered and governed by them; there will be no need of any external power to compel them; yea, they will be willing to be taught and directed by the meaneſt that is able in any thing to inform them and counſel them for the beſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, together, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next words, <hi>their young ones ſhall lye down together;</hi> which is added, the better to ſet forth the real change that ſhould be wrought in theſe ravenous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in that their regard to their young ones ſhould not make them, as it is uſually with ſuch beaſts, the more eager and violent to make a prey of all they come near; <hi>and the Lyon ſhall eat ſtraw like the Ox,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, the greateſt and mightieſt, and thoſe that were moſt ſavage amongſt them, ſhall yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be fed with the word and Sacraments, no leſs than the meaneſt of the common ſort of people; Or, as others ſay, they ſhall not live any longer upon ſpoil and rapine, but ſhall be content with what they can get by any honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and imployment. And it may well be, which ſome think, that in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion here uſed, there is an alluſion to the ſtate the Creatures lived in at their firſt Creation before man ſinned; when, as many learned men think, they all lived upon ſuch fruit as grew out of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29, 30. neither was there
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42788:78"/>
any that lived by prey and devouring of other Creatures. But indeed, all that I conceive is intended hereby, is, that thoſe men that were before moſt fierce and miſchievous, upon the change that ſhould be wrought in them by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhould be as harmleſs towards thoſe with whom they converſed, as any others were.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the ſucking Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The weakeſt and ſimpleſt amongſt Gods people (ſome ſay, thoſe that are new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted, new-born Babes in Chriſt) ſhall without any danger converſe with thoſe that formerly were moſt ſubtile, poyſonous and hurtful; yea, the expreſſion here uſed of their <hi>playing on the hole of the aſp,</hi> may ſeem to imply, that they ſhould count it a recreation and delight to converſe with them. And the ſame is in other words repeated again in the following clauſe, <hi>And the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den,</hi> to wit, out of a childiſh curioſity to thruſt his hand, as if it were into a birds-neſt, to feel what is there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, they ſhall be ſo far from deſtroying, that they ſhall not ſo much as hurt one another, <hi>in all my holy mountain;</hi> that is, in my whole Church, ſpread abroad throughout the whole World, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1. Whereas other mountains are uſually full of ravenous beaſts, it ſhall not be ſo (ſaith the Lord) <hi>in my holy mountain;</hi> and that becauſe Gods people there, ſhall be a holy people. And therefore we ſee that this wonderful change here ſpoken of, is meant only of thoſe that are true Believers, truly regenerate and made new Creatures; <hi>for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledg of the Lord,</hi> that is, of the true and ſaving Knowledge of God in Chriſt, <hi>as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> that is, thoſe hollow places of the earth wherein the Sea is held. The meaning is, That the Knowledge of God ſhould be ſpread abroad every where all the World over, as there is water every where in the Sea; and that there ſhould be far more abundant Knowledge in thoſe days, than there had been in the time of the Law; by means whereof there ſhould be ſuch a marvellous change made in the Spirits of men. And therefore the Prophet ſpeaks of this, as of a rare and unuſual thing, that had not hitherto been ſeen in the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, as the cauſe of that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful peace that ſhould be amongſt men, mentioned in the foregoing verſes, even amongſt thoſe that were formerly of ſuch a brutiſh and ſavage temper of Spirit. <hi>And in that day there ſhall be a root of Jeſſe,</hi> that is, that <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> mentioned before, verſ. 1. ſpringing up out of the root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (for which ſee the Note there) namely, the Lord Chriſt; we have the like expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 14.5. <hi>He ſhall grow as the Lillie, and caſt forth his roots as</hi> Lebanon; and concerning Chriſt alſo, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.2. <hi>He ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground;</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. and 22.16. where he is called <hi>the root of</hi> David, that is, the branch that ſprung out of <hi>Davids</hi> ſtock or family. And as for that which follows, <hi>which ſhall ſtand for an enſign of the people;</hi> the meaning of that is, That this low contemptible branch ſhould by degrees mount up to ſuch a height, that he ſhould be as an enſign lifted up in the ſight of all the Nations of the World, who ſhould thereupon through Faith, as by a kind of Divine inſtinct, gather themſelves together to him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42788:79"/>
from all parts of the earth, even as ſoldiers do to a Standard or Enſign that is ſet up, that under his conduct and defence they may maintain a conſtant fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſpiritual enemies. All which was accompliſhed when Chriſt was lifted up firſt on the Croſs, <hi>John</hi> 8.28. and 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See the Note <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. And ſo the Apoſtle doth expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this Prophecy concerning Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.12. <hi>And again</hi> Eſaias <hi>ſaith, There ſhall be a root of Jeſſe, and he that ſhall riſe to reign over the Gentiles, in him ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> As for the laſt words, <hi>and his reſt ſhall be glorious;</hi> ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this of Chriſts death and burial, to wit, how ignominious ſoever his death ſhould be to him in the ſight of the world, yet he ſhould be then and thereby exceedinlgy glorified, according to that which he ſaid when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf to dye, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Father, the hour is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee.</hi> And indeed it cannot be denied, but that this Reſt of his, was glorious, firſt, becauſe he then overcame all the powers of darkneſs: and 2ly. becauſe his name was then highly honoured by the great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things that were done at his Death, and the eclipſing of the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially by his Reſurrection, honoured with the apparition of Angels, and many miraculous paſſages, and by his triumphant Aſcenſion into Heaven; and 3ly. becauſe of the great Glory given him by the Chuch for that great work of their Redemption. But yet I do rather conceive, that the meaning of theſe words in this place, is either, that the <hi>Reſt</hi> and Peace of his Church would be very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; or elſe that his Church, the place where he had determined to ſettle his perpetual reſidence, (according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his habitation: this is my Reſt for ever,</hi> &amp;c. and that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the world;</hi> and the people upon whom he had ſetled his love and favour, ſhould be very glorious, to wit, in regard of the glorious ſigns and effects of his preſence amongſt them, in the abundant knowledge and eminent holineſs that ſhould be wrought in them by his word and Spirit, and in the great and wonderful things that ſhould be done amongſt them for their deliverance and ſafegard. And herein there ſeems to be an Alluſion to that which is often formerly ſaid, That the Tabernacle and Temple was filled with the Glory of God. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34, 35. <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.23. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.11. And ſee alſo the Note before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] In the foregoing verſe, the Prophet foretold the Converſion of the Gentiles; here now he adds, that at the ſame time the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould alſo be converted. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the Lord ſhall ſet his hand again the ſecond time,</hi> &amp;c. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the firſt deliverance here intimated to be that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of

                  <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the ſecond here promiſed, to be that of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> that were delivered out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only of the two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and here the Prophet ſpeaks of the deliverance of his people of all the Tribes from all parts of the World, and that too in the days of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (that enſign that ſhould be lifted up, whereof he had ſpoken in the foregoing verſe) I rather think, that this is meant of their deliverance by Chriſt from the ſpiritual Bondage of Satan, Sin, Death and Hell, to wit, that as the Lord did once before with an out ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arm, deliver the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo he would <hi>the ſecond time</hi> with great zeal again ſet himſelf <hi>to recover the remnant of his people which ſhall be left;</hi> that is, to bring home to himſelf by Chriſt thoſe of his ancient people the <hi>Jews,</hi> which ſhall there remain undeſtroyed amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as being ſtill mindful of the Covenant he had formerly made with them. And this was partly accompliſhed in thoſe <hi>many thouſands of</hi> Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20. (though but <hi>a remnant</hi> in compariſon of the whole body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that were by Chriſt and his Apoſtles won to embrace the Faith of the Goſpel; and ſhall be more fully performed, when the main body of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of that Nation ſhall in the laſt days be brought in to Chriſt; of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks clearly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. And indeed becauſe the Prophet doth in this place, firſt foretel the gathering in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Chriſt (in the foregoing verſe) and then doth here after that, add this concerning the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the <hi>Jews;</hi> therefore many learned Divines have thought that it is that laſt Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that is here principally intended by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. As for the places here mentioned, from which the believing <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be gathered <hi>from Aſſyria, and from Egypt, and from Buthros, and from Cuſh, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the Iſlands of the Sea;</hi> it is hard clearly to determine what all theſe Countrys are. It may ſuffice us to know, that upon the grievous miſeries that were brought upon this people, firſt by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and afterward by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> many of them did of their own accord leave the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and flee into <hi>Egypt,</hi> (of which, <hi>Pathros</hi> ſeems to have been one particular Province, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.1, 15.) See <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.57. and 44.27, 28. and ſo likewiſe into other Countrys; and that many of them that were carried away Captives by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> might by them be ſold to other Nations, and ſo be diſperſed all the world over: And evident it is in Scripture, that all thoſe Countrys that bordered upon the Sea, and were divided from them by the Sea, were by the <hi>Jews</hi> uſually called <hi>the Iſlands of the Sea,</hi> Jer. 47.4. See alſo the Note <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he ſhall ſet up an enſign for the Nations,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ver. 10. But this I conceive is a farther Explanation of what was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, concerning the Converſion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and therefore by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Lord ſhould ſet up the enſign of the Goſpel <hi>for the Nations,</hi> either the Prophet intended, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be gathered in hereby to the Church from the Nations amongſt whom they were diſperſed; or elſe, that the Nations ſhould hereby be ſummoned to bring in the <hi>Jews</hi> unto Chriſt; or at leaſt, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, together with other Nations: for that the Prophet doth principally here ſpeak of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42788:80"/>
of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore by ſaying that the Lord ſhould ſet up the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel <hi>for the Nations,</hi> either the Prophet intended, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be gathered in hereby to the Church from the Nations, amongſt whom they were diſperſed; or elſe, that the Nations hereby ſhould be ſummoned to bring the <hi>Jews</hi> unto Chriſt; or at leaſt, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, together with other Nations; for that the Prophet doth principally here ſpeak of the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is evident by the following words, <hi>and ſhall aſſemble the out-caſts of</hi> Iſrael. (See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.2.) <hi>and gather together the diſperſed of</hi> Judah, <hi>from the four corners of the earth.</hi> It is in the Herew, <hi>from the four wings of the earth,</hi> that is, from all parts of the world, even from the utmoſt skirts of the earth; wherein there is a clear Alluſion to that promiſe made to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> concerning Gods bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them home upon their Repentance from the uttermoſt parts of the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The envy alſo of</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall depart,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in the days of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> they of the ten Tribes ſhall not envy thoſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as now they do; <hi>and the Adverſaries of</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be cut off;</hi> that is, As they ſhall not be any longer enemies one to another, ſo alſo their Foreign enemies ſhall be deſtroyed, that ſo they may every way enjoy the greater peace. Ephraim <hi>ſhall not envy</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall not vex</hi> Ephraim: The ſum of all is briefly this; By foretelling the ceaſing of all envy and diſcord between <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> who had been ſo many years contending about the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that which the Prophet intends is, That the people of God under Chriſt ſhould live peaceably together, as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without any diſcord or enmity one againſt another. How the truth of this Prophecy can conſiſt with the great Diſſentions and Wars that have been, and are ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, ſee in the foregoing Note verſe 9. and in the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4. The Prophet ſpeaks only of real Chriſtians, and doth comprehend in theſe words that peaceable eſtate whereto all ſhall be brought to at laſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>But they ſhall flee upon the ſhoulders of the Philiſtines towards the weſt,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The people of God, both of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhall joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together with much ſpeed and fervency of zeal, fall upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel, even as an Eagle or Hawk doth fall upon the ſhoulders of any thing, Lamb or Kid, or ſmaller Bird, which they ſeize upon as their prey; and ſome of them they ſhall bring in to Chriſt, and others they ſhall at leaſt render inexcuſable; yet indeed this expreſſion of fleeing <hi>upon the ſhoulders of the Philiſtines,</hi> may imply the bringing of them under the yoke and dominion of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. becauſe the yoke or burden on the ſhoulder, is an Emblem of ſervitude. See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.4. and 10.27. <hi>They ſhall ſpoil them of the Eaſt together;</hi> that is, They ſhall gather in Gods elect from amongſt them, in deſpite of all the mighty men of the world that ſhall oppoſe them. See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.6. <hi>They ſhall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab,</hi> that is, They ſhall ſeize upon them, and ſubdue them, according to that expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. <hi>I will ſet his hand alſo in the Sea, and his right hand in the Rivers.</hi> And ſome think too, that this implies, how ſuddenly and eaſily they ſhould be ſubdued by the Goſpel, even with as much eaſe as a man may put his hand
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42788:80"/>
into a birds-neſt, to take the young ones from thence. And ſo there may be an Alluſion to what the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had ſaid before in a vaunting way, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.14. <hi>and the children of Ammon ſhall obey them,</hi> to wit, by embracing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of of the Goſpel. The driſt therefore of all theſe expreſſions, is to ſhew, how the remnant of the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhould believe in Chriſt, ſhould immediately with all chearfulneſs and diligence beſtir themſelves to ſpread abroad the Goſpel for the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But in expreſſing this, he mentions only thoſe neighbouring Nations that were making War upon the land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, the Edomites, and Moabites, either becauſe the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> did firſt carry the Goſpel into thoſe neighbouring Countrys, and then afterwards into the remoter parts of the world (as indeed we read of <hi>Philips</hi> preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at <hi>Azotus,</hi> or <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> Act. 8.40. and <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Lydda,</hi> Act. 9.32. and at <hi>Joppa,</hi> Act. 10.5. which were Cities in the Country of the Philiſtines) or elſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that when this bleſſed peace foretold ſhould be wrought amongſt them by the Goſpel, even thoſe Nations that were now continually afflicting them, ſhould by them be ſubdued to the Scepter of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And the Lord ſhall utterly deſtroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the tongue of the Egyptian Sea,</hi> here, is meant the Red-Sea, that out of the main Ocean ſhoots up into the land, between <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the form and faſhion of a tongue, broader at the firſt, but growing narrower ſtill by degrees, and licking the land, as it goeth along; for having before, ver. 11. compared that <hi>ſecond</hi> deliverance there promiſed them, to wit, their deliverance from their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bondage, and the reducing of them to the obedience of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Lord Chriſt, to the firſt deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſuitable hereunto he doth in theſe words promiſe, that as in that firſt deliverance, God made way for his people to go into <hi>Canaan</hi> by dividing the Red-Sea before them, ſo in that ſecond here promiſed, he would not divide, but <hi>deſtroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea,</hi> that is, utterly dry it up, that it ſhould be no more. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only, that he would in the days of the Goſpel utterly remove all lets and obſtacles, that might hinder the bringing of his people unto Chriſt, by whom a way was opened for them into the Heavenly <hi>Canaan; and with his mighty wind ſhall he ſhake his hand over the River, and ſhall ſmite it in the ſeven ſtreams, and make men go over dry-ſhod;</hi> that is, he ſhall utterly dry up the River <hi>Nilus</hi> in her ſeven ſtreams, as formerly by a mighty wind he divided the Red-Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 14.21. It is evident by many ancient Writers, that <hi>Nilus,</hi> called <hi>the River of Egypt,</hi> Joſh. 15.4. did, as it drew near to the Sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it ſelf into ſeven Channels, which were commonly called the ſeven Mouths of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whereby it emptied it ſelf into the Sea. Now becauſe the paſſages out of Countrys are chiefly for the moſt part ſhut up by Seas and Rivers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to imply, that nothing ſhould be able to hinder the Apoſtles and others from ſpreading the Goſpel over all the world, and from bringing in Gods Elect to Chriſt from all Nations; the Prophet in a figurative expreſſion ſaith here, that to the Red-Sea, and the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> even near the Sea, when it was deepeſt, ſhould be dried up before them. As for that expreſſion of ſhaking his hand, <hi>with his mighty wind ſhall he ſhake his hand over the River,</hi> either it is mentioned as a geſture of threatning (ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.32.) Or elſe by way of alluding
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42788:81"/>
to <hi>Moſes</hi> lifting up his Rod over the Red-Sea, when it was thereby divided before the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And there ſhall be a high-way for the remnant of his people, which ſhall be left from Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a plain, eaſie Cauſey-way; Becauſe the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> of the ten Tribes, that were already carried into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpoke this, or were ſhortly to be carried thither, might ſeem to be utterly loſt and caſt off by God without all hope of recovery, as being carried much farther than thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> were, that were carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not likely to return back to their Country, when thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould return; therefore the Prophet doth here particularly aſſure them, that even they ſhould at laſt be brought home to Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpel. However incredible it might ſeem in the eye of Reaſon, yet God would make a clear way for this their return, <hi>like as it was to Iſrael in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt;</hi> as God did miraculouſly effect that, ſo he would as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly accompliſh this.</p>

In the twelve following Chapters the Prophet foretels the ſore Judgments and ruine that ſhould ſhortly come upon moſt of the foreign States and Nations round about them; thoſe eſpecially upon whoſe help they had moſt relied, or by whom they had been, or were hereafter like to be moſt vexed and oppreſſed, ſuch as were the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> and others. And this was purpoſely done, that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſee, that theſe Judgments being thus foretold, came from God; and that all Nations are under his power and command, that they might be afraid of thoſe ſins for which they ſaw them puniſhed ſo ſeverely; as conſidering, that if God ſpared not the wickedneſs of thoſe heathen people, much leſs would he ſpare them that had the Law and Word of God to inform them. 3ly. That they might not think that God dealt worſe with them, than with others; or that he favoured thoſe wicked Nations. And 4ly. That they might be comforted with this diſcovery of Gods love to them, and tender care over them, in the vengeance he would bring upon their miſchievous enemies. Accordingly therefore he begins firſt with foretelling the Deſtruction that ſhould come upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> the chief City of the <hi>Caldean</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, built at firſt, as it is generally held, by <hi>Semiramis;</hi> but, it ſeems, greatly enlarged and beautified by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> as appears by that vaunting ſpeech of his, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the houſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the might of my power, and for the Honour of my Majeſty?</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Babylonians</hi> (againſt whom this Prophecy was delivered <hi>in the year that King Ahaz died,</hi> Chap. 14.28.) were like to prove their moſt formidable enemies, by whom <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be deſtroyed, the Temple burnt, and the people carried Captives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> therefore to fore-arm the faithful againſt the terror of theſe ſad Calamities, and to ſupport the poor Captives in that long
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42788:82"/>
Captivity, it was moſt neceſſary, that the downfal of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſhould be foretold, as the means whereby a way ſhould be opened unto them for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again into their own Country.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Lift ye up a ſtandard upon the high mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken as in Gods name to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> that were to deſtroy <hi>Babylon;</hi> And indeed the <hi>Medes</hi> are afterward in this Chapter expreſly named, ver. 17. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will ſtir up the Medes against them.</hi> By <hi>the high mountain</hi> ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that this City, though ſituated in a low, plain Country, is ſo called, either becauſe in its vaſt greatneſs, and the exceeding height and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of her buildings, it looked like ſome great Mountain, and ſeemed too as unmoveable as a Mountain; or elſe becauſe the State of <hi>Babylon</hi> did ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lift up her ſelf, and was at that time in Power and Glory exalted above all other Nations. And indeed it is clear, that upon theſe accounts <hi>Babylon</hi> is elſewhere called <hi>a mountain,</hi> Jer. 51, 25. <hi>Behold, I am againſt thee, O deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountain, faith the Lord.</hi> Now they that thus underſtand theſe words, do accordingly hold, that by lifting up a ſtandard upon this <hi>high mountain,</hi> the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> is intended, becauſe when a City is taken, the ſoldiers are wont to ſet up their colours upon the walls; and as a parallel place hereto, they alledge that paſſage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Set up the ſtandard upon the walls of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe they alſo expound the following words, <hi>Exalt the voice unto them, ſhake the hand,</hi> becauſe, ſay they, there is never more ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor lifting up and brandiſhing the ſword in the hand, than when a City is taken; but with moſt of our beſt Expoſitors, I rather conceive, that the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here made of lifting up a ſtandard, is to foretel the gathering together of a mighty Army for this ſervice againſt <hi>Babylon.</hi> See the Note Chap. 5.26. and to imply how readily upon the leaſt ſign or notice given, ſoldiers ſhould come flowing in to them; and the ſtandard is appointed to be lifted up <hi>upon the high mountain,</hi> becauſe they uſed in this caſe to ſet up their Enſigns, and diſplay their Banners upon the tops of hills and mountains, from whence ſuch a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal might beſt be deſcryed. As for the following words, <hi>exalt the voice unto them, ſhake the hand,</hi> either the ſame thing is intended, to wit, the calling in of ſoldiers near or far off, by crying out, or by beckning to them with the hand; or elſe it is meant of giving them a ſignal, whether by ſhaking the hand, or by ſome ſhout or word of command, by way of encouraging them to make an aſſault upon the City; and that alſo to ſignifie how ready they ſhould be to do it; <hi>that they may go into the gates of the Nobles,</hi> that is, into the houſes of the Nobles, which is ſaid, becauſe ſoldiers at ſuch a time are wont to chuſe to break into ſuch houſes, where they expect the moſt and beſt pillage; or into the gates of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the King kept his Court commonly, and ſo moſt of the Nobility had their conſtant reſidence there; or where many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by reaſon of their great wealth, lived like Princes or Nobles. And withal, obſervable it is, that to ſignifie how eaſily they ſhould prevail over this ſeeming ſtrong and invincible City, he ſpeaks of the taking of it, as if there were no more to be done for the effecting of it, but their meer going into the gates without any reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I have commanded my ſanctified ones,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>The noiſe of a multitude,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet ſpeaks this in ſuch a manner, as if he would report, that he heard that actually doing, which in the foregoing verſe the Lord ſaid he had commanded to be done. As a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſet upon a Watch-Tower is wont firſt to relate what he hears, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he diſcovers what that noiſe was, then to make known that too; ſo doth the Prophet here: <hi>The noiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of a multitude in the Mountains, as of a great people;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Methinks I hear a confuſed noiſe upon the Mountains, as is wont to be in a place where a great multitude of people are gathered together. And then he tells what this noiſe was, and that God was amongſt them; <hi>a tumultuous noiſe of the Kingdoms of Nations ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together,</hi> that is, of people of ſeveral Nations and Kingdoms; which is ſaid, becauſe the army gathered againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> was to conſiſt of many Nations, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 50.9. <hi>I will raiſe and cauſe to come against Babylon an aſſembly of great Nations from the North-Country.</hi> And ſo again Chap. 51.27, 28. <hi>The Lord of hosts muſtereth the host of the battel,</hi> as if he had ſaid, And where this King of Nations is Commander in chief, it is no marvel though ſuch a numberleſs multitude come in to him upon the ſetting

It is true indeed that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s deſtruction was nearer at hand than <hi>Babylon</hi>'s (for it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred years ere <hi>Babylon was deſtroyed</hi>) and therefore there might ſeem to be greater cauſe to call upon the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to howl, than the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But for this we muſt know, that the drift of the Prophet here, was to comfort the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt they came to be Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> by letting them know how confidently they might expect that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that is here threatned to <hi>Babylon.</hi> And notwithſtanding it was ſo long ere <hi>Babylon</hi> was to be deſtroyed, yet 1. with reference to God, to whom ſo long a time was but as a day; And 2ly, with reference to the ſecurity of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who were ſo confident in the ſtrength of their City and Empire, it might well be ſaid, That this day of the Lord was at hand, it being nearer indeed than any of them would have expected; and ſee the Notes on the laſt verſe of this Chapter, <hi>it ſhall come as a Deſtruction from the Almighty;</hi> that is, it ſhall be inevitable and irreparable, ſo grievous and horrid, that every one ſhall plainly ſee, that it was the work, and from the wrath of an Almighty God.</p>

But I rather think it is meant of the paleneſs of their faces through fear, which is that the Prophet is here ſpeaking of; and that therefore it is ſaid, <hi>their faces ſhall be as flames,</hi> either becauſe their faces ſhould look pale, and wan, like the flame of a fire; or elſe becauſe their faces ſhould be pale, and ſwarthy, and dim, and dead-coloured, and full of horror, even as it uſeth to be with men that work at the Forge, or that ſtand before ſome kind of fire, that uſe to look as if they had no blood in their bodies, ſo that this place may well be parallel'd with thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.5, 6. <hi>We have heard a voice of trembling of fear—and all faces are turned into paleneſs;</hi> and <hi>Joel</hi> 2.6. <hi>Before their faces the people ſhall be much pained; all faces ſhall gather blackneſs.</hi>

Heavenly lights do ſhine clear and bright, God ſeems to ſmile upon men; therefore Gods frowning upon the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> may be implyed by this darkning of them. But I rather think, that all that is implied is, that they ſhould be in a moſt doleful and diſmal Condition, void of all Comfort, and not knowing which way to turn themſelves; inſomuch that the very light of the Sun, Moon and Stars, which are ſo pleaſing and delightſome to others, ſhould be as no light, no way comfortable to them, but rather diſpleaſing and diſtaſtful to them; neither ſhould any of the Creatures yield them any refreſhing or comfort.

               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>I will make a man more precious than fine Gold, even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.]</hi> The meaning is either, 1.

See the Note 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. Or, 2ly. That the ſoldiers ſhould be ſo cruel to them, that they ſhould not ſpare their lives for the greateſt quantities of the pureſt gold that could be tendered to them, according to that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, ver. 17. <hi>Behold, I will ſtir up the Medes againſt them, which ſhall not regard ſilver, and as for gold they ſhall not delight in it;</hi> which may ſeem the more probable, becauſe we read, that in that night when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> their King was ſlain, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.30. And it is likely that with him, many of the great ones were likewiſe cut off, that would have been glad to have redeemed their lives at a great rate. But yet becauſe we find not either in the Scripture, or in any other Hiſtory, that there was ſuch a general ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made of the inhabitants, when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> therefore many learned Expoſitors do underſtand both this, and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of the utter Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> in future times, whereof this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of that proud City by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſhould be only the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yea, our Annotations do propound it as conſiderable, whether this that is ſaid here, That a man ſhall be <hi>more precious than fine gold,</hi> may not be ſpoken with reſpect to <hi>Babylons</hi> being utterly deſerted in the time of this her great danger, by thoſe auxiliary forces which they had taken in for their defence; of which the Prophet ſpeaks afterward again, ver. 14.</p>

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And it ſhall be as the chaſed Roe, and as a Sheep that no man taketh up,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Babylonian</hi> army ſhall flee <hi>as a Roe,</hi> chaſed by ſome Huntſman or wild beaſt, or ſhall wander up and down like a ſtragling ſheep, that is not able neither by flight, nor otherwiſe, to ſecure it ſelf; and that hath no ſhepherd to take it up or defend it. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.6. The meaning is, that they ſhould not be able to bear the ſight of the enemy, but ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently run away, and ſeek to ſhift for themſelves; and that no man ſhould be able to keep them to their colours, or to bring them to make a ſtand, or to rally again together; or elſe, that no man ſhould dare to receive them into their houſes when they fled, to ſhelter and hide them there. And indeed, that this is chiefly meant of the auxiliary forces, which they had taken into <hi>Babylon</hi> from other Nations, that they ſhould disband and be gone for fear, or flee before the enemy, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the following words, <hi>they ſhall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own Land;</hi> which fully agreeth with that which the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> foretold concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 50.16. and 51.9.</p>

But I rather think that it may better be underſtood of all, both within and without the City; and that the meaning is, that the enemy ſhould put all to the ſword they could find, whether they were Natives, or Strangers that lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, or that had <hi>joyned</hi> themſelves to them as ſoldiers that came in to aid them. Or elſe by them that were <hi>found,</hi> are meant, thoſe that were found wandring and fleeing alone by themſelves; and by thoſe that were <hi>joyned,</hi> thoſe that were gotten together into a body, or were gathered together into any place of ſtrength for the defence of themſelves.</p>

And indeed conſidering that this was foretold by the Prophet about two hundred years before it came to paſs, when the <hi>Medes</hi> had no quarrel againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were beſides, a poor deſpiſed people comparatively, and no way likely to ſubdue ſuch a mighty City; this was a clear evidence, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had this by revelation from God.

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Their bows alſo ſhall daſh the young men to pieces,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning may be either, 1.

See <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.3. to wit, either becauſe there ſhould be no graſs, where the ruines of the City lay, but only nettles, and thorns, and briars ſhould grow up there; or becauſe of thoſe terrible and hurtful Creatures that ſhould lodg there, as is expreſſed in the following verſe; or as ſome think, becauſe the very ſoil of the land thereabouts ſhould be accurſed of God. However, the drift of theſe words is to ſet forth the wonderful change that God would bring upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> in that thieviſh <hi>Arabians</hi> and poor ſhepherds ſhall not vouchſafe to have their abode there, where Kings and Princes had wont to dwell.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>But wild beaſts of the deſert ſhall lye there,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſuch as uſe to lodge in deſert places. The word in the Original, <hi>Ziim,</hi> is derived from an Hebrew word, which ſignifieth a wild and waſte place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.6. And therefore it is ſometimes uſed for people, that inhabit ſuch dry and deſert places, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.8. where this word is tranſlated, <hi>they that dwell in the wilderneſs.</hi> But here it muſt needs be meant of ſome wild Creatures living in ſuch ſolitary places; for which ſee the Note alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.14. <hi>and their houſes ſhall be full of doleful Creatures (Octim</hi> it is in the Hebrew) which ſeems to be derived from an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of exclaiming and crying out in a time of affrightment and fear; or elſe of mourning or groaning; and conſequently Interpreters hold, that the word imports either Creatures of ſuch a terrible aſpect, that they ſhould make men, when they ſee them, cry out for fear; or elſe ſuch as make a mournful, dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe; <hi>and Owls ſhall dwell there,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 30.29. It is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>the daughters of the Owle,</hi> that are wont to make a dreadful skreeking noiſe when their Dams are from them, eſpecially when they want food. But that may be only an Hebraiſm; <hi>and Satyrs ſhall dance there,</hi> whereby I conceive is meant either ſome kind of ſtrange, monſtrous, ugly beaſts (which ſeems the more probable, becauſe elſewhere the Prophet ſpeaks of them, as of beaſts that are wont to cry one to another, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.14. <hi>The wild beaſts of the deſert ſhall alſo meet with the wild beaſts of the Iſland, and the Satyr ſhall cry to his fellow</hi>); or elſe Divels, appearing to men like hairy, ſhag Creatures. See the Note <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.7. ſuch as it may well be the Satyrs were, of whom the Ancients ſpeak ſo often, that uſed to haunt Woods and Deſerts, having faces and hands like men, and going upright as men do, but yet were horned, and hairy, and cloven-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Goats. And indeed ſuch unclean Spirits love to appear, and to haunt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42788:86"/>
men in ſuch ſolitary places, becauſe there men are moſt apt to lie ſtruck with terror; and thence may that be, Math. 12.43. <hi>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places.</hi> And that Prophecy concerning myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> is fully parallel with this, Revel. 18.2. <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul ſpirit, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ſo likewiſe in the following words, <hi>And her days ſhall not be prolonged;</hi> either the ſame is again repeated, to wit, that the day of her overthrow ſhould not long be deferred; or the meaning may be, that the days of her proſperity ſhould not continue much longer.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>FOR the Lord will have mercy on Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.] This is given as a reaſon, why God would haſten the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> foretold in the foregoing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, as he had ſaid he would do in the laſt words of that Chapter; to wit, that the Jews might by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was to ſubdue <hi>Babylon,</hi> be ſent home again into their own Country. See the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1. <hi>For the Lord will have mercy on Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and will yet chooſe Iſrael, and ſet them in their own Land;</hi> that is, He will yet again receive them into his favour, whom he had caſt off for a time, as if he had choſen them anew; or, He will by appearing wonderfully for them, make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that they were his choſen people; or, He will chuſe or pick out the remnant of his people, whom he intends to deliver, out of the places where they were diſperſed. And by <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> are meant the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Jews, principally thoſe of the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> but together with them, thoſe likewiſe of the ten Tribes, that came in to thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and ſo were with them carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and afterward ſent back with them into the Land of <hi>Judea: And the ſtrangers ſhall be joyned with them, and they ſhall cleave to the houſe of Jacob:</hi> that is, many of the Heathens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they had lived in <hi>Babylon, Chaldeans, Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> being converted to the Jewiſh Religion, either by the inſtruction and perſwaſion of the Jews, or by obſerving the holineſs of their lives, or by taking notice of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42788:87"/>
of their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2.) ſhall joyn themſelves to them, and go along with them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.65.) as it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. But though this was partly thus accompliſhed, as in a Type, by ſtrangers joyning themſelves to the Jews in their return into their own Land; yet the converſion of the Gentiles in the days of the Goſpel, when they joyned themſelves to the Church of the Jews, is the principal thing here intended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the people ſhall take them, and bring them to their place,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, the ſeveral Tribes and Families of the Jews ſhall take thoſe <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> thoſe Proſelites mentioned in the foregoing verſe, that had joyned themſelves <hi>to the houſe of Jacob,</hi> and receiving them into their company and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſhall carry them along with them into the Land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But the meaning rather is, that the people of ſeveral Nations, the <hi>Babylonians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> with others that dwelt in the way, whereby the Jews were to return home into their own Country, ſhould afford the Jews all the reſpect and help they could, in and for their return into <hi>Judea,</hi> entertaining them and encouraging them on their way, and furniſhing them with cattel, and carriages, and all other neceſſary accommodations for their Journey, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> had commanded. See the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.4. and ſee alſo <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.7.9. <hi>And the houſe of Iſrael ſhall poſſeſs them in the land of the Lord</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.17.) <hi>for ſervants and handmaids;</hi> that is, many of theſe people ſhall become ſervants to the Jews, when they are ſetled in their own Land. And this ſome underſtand of thoſe Proſelites or Strangers that had joyned themſelves to the Jews, either that they ſhould be as ſerviceable to the Jews, as any ſervants could be; or elſe that in proceſs of time ſome of them, or their children, ſhould be ſold to them for ſervants, which was indeed agreeable to God's Law concerning Servants, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.44, 45, 46. And others again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who being vanquiſhed by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſhould be ſold by them to the Jews for ſlaves; or by reaſon of their penury ſhould voluntarily yield themſelves up to be their ſervants. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>And they ſhall take them captives, whoſe captives they were, and they ſhall rule over their oppreſſors;</hi> that is, thoſe Nations ſhould be ſervants to the Jews, to whom the Jews had formerly been in bondage: which ſome alſo extend to the Jews vanquiſhing and bringing into bondage thoſe Nations, after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the days of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as had before lorded over them. But now moſt Expoſitors underſtand all this ſpiritually, as well they may, of the converſion of the Gentiles by the Miniſtry of the Jews in the days of the Goſpel; to wit, that the Jews ſhould by the Preaching of the Goſpel bring thoſe Nations under the yoke of Chriſt, to whom they had formerly been captives; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Gentiles ſhould ſhew great reſpect to them, as owning them to be God's firſt-born people, and ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the word of the Goſpel, and ſhould be ſubſervient to the believing Jews, in labouring to eſtabliſh Chriſt's Kingdom in the world, and in gathering in his Elect to his Church. So that the Dominion here promiſed to the Jews over the Gentiles, is not a Temporal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but a Spiritual; their ruling over them in the Lord.

thy ſorrow,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when thou ſhalt be delivered from thy Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and from all the griefs, and fears, and ſore miſeries thou there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duredſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>That thou ſhalt take up this Proverb,</hi> &amp;c.] or <hi>taunting ſpeech;</hi> See the Note, Numb. 21.27. <hi>againſt the King of Babylon,</hi> to wit, <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs, together with whom that State fell; <hi>and ſay, How hath the Oppreſſor ceaſed? the golden City ceaſed?</hi> That is, the City that was ſo full of Gold, and was ſo confident in her exceſſive wealth. And therefore ſet forth by <hi>a head of Gold,</hi> Dan. 2.32, 38. and by <hi>a golden cup,</hi> Jer. 51.7. <hi>Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lords hand.</hi> It is ſpoken by way of deriding <hi>Babels</hi> pride and confidence: as if it had been ſaid, How is it poſſible that this cruel Tyrant and his golden Monarchy ſhould be thus ruined in one night, and ſo by that means the poor people of God be delivered from their bondage? That which we render, <hi>the golden city,</hi> ſome tranſlate, <hi>the exactreſs of gold;</hi> that is, the City that drained all the gold from other Nations: But our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I conceive is the beſt. However obſervable it is, that the word in the Original ſeems to be <hi>Syriack,</hi> the language then uſed amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans, Dan.</hi> 2.4. and ſo the Prophet mocks the <hi>Chaldees</hi> with a word taken from the <hi>Chaldean tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The Lord hath broken the ſtaff of the wicked, and the Scepter of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.]</hi> See the Notes, Chap. 9.4. and 10.5. This is in anſwer to the foregoing queſtion, verſ. 4. as if the Prophet had ſaid, Wonder not at the ſudden deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Babel:</hi> It is the Lord that hath done it by way of taking vengeance on them for their horrid wickedneſs and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>He who ſmote the people in wrath,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Not in a way of Juſtice, but of Rage and Fury, <hi>with a continul ſtroak;</hi> that is, immoderately, and implacably, and with extreme cruelty. He never thought he had laid on load enough; neither was there any pacifying his wrath. And therefore the Prophet adds, that the like ſhould be done to him, <hi>He that ruled the Nation in anger, is perſecuted, and none hindereth;</hi> that is, he ſhall be deſtroyed inevitably and irreparably: he ſhall not be able to defend himſelf; and for others, they ſhall not be able, neither ſhall they have any mind to do it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The whole earth is at reſt and quiet,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Inhabitants of the world, that could never be quiet for this proud City: <hi>They break forth into ſinging;</hi> to wit, for the downfal of this great oppreſſing Empire.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Yea, the Fir-trees rejoice at thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of thoſe States and Princes that had been oppreſſed formerly by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> See the Note, Chap. 2.13. But it is better underſtood literally, that it ſhould be a joy, as it were, to the trees of the Foreſt, that the <hi>Babylonian</hi> was deſtroyed, becauſe he had wont to make ſuch havock in felling down the <hi>Fir-trees,</hi> and as it follows, <hi>the cedars of Lebanon,</hi> that were ſo far from him, partly to make paſſages for his Armies, and partly for the building of his Houſes and Ships, and for the raiſing of his Bulwarks, and other uſes in his Wars; whereas now, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> being hewed down, they ſhould ſtand quietly in their places without any moleſtation, <hi>Since thou art laid down,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>no feller is come up againſt us.</hi> And indeed it may well be, that this is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42788:88"/>
ſpoken with reference to that which had been ſaid before, Chap. 2.13. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the great havock that ſhould be made by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> in the foreſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Hell from beneath,</hi> &amp;c.] Or rather, <hi>the grave from beneath,</hi> becauſe this agrees beſt with that which followeth, ver. 11. <hi>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave—the worm is ſpread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</hi> Having related, how all the inhabitants of the earth, yea, even the ſenſeleſs creatures, the trees, ſhould rejoyce at the down-fall of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet now proceeds to ſhew, in a like poetical ſtrain, that not only the living, but the dead alſo from beneath ſhould rejoice at his ruin and death, and inſult over him: To which end he ſpeaks here of <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>the grave,</hi> as under the perſon of ſome great Prince or King, having the dead under his dominion and command. <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>the grave from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy comming;</hi> whereby ſeems to be meant, either 1. That this Prince of the lower Regions was <hi>moved</hi> with fear, to wit, at the report of the coming of this mighty Monarch towards them, as fearing leſt he would cauſe as great troubles amongſt the dead as he had done amongſt the living, and that he was coming to ſubdue them under his dominion, as he had done the ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world above; and thereupon was reſolved to <hi>meet</hi> him, and to oppoſe his coming thither: Or elſe 2. That he was moved with awe of his greatneſs, and with care about entertaining him with all requiſite ſolemnity, as people uſe to be when they hear of ſome great King that is coming towards them, and ſo thought to go forth to meet, and to receive him magnificently, with all the honour they could afford him. Or. 3. That he was moved with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his fall, or with indignation againſt him for his horrid oppreſſions and cruelty, and ſo intended to go out to <hi>meet</hi> him, that they might keep him off, as unworthy to be buried and lodged amongſt them, or that he might inſult over him for his pride and cruelty; which laſt ſeems indeeed the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe this is afterwards expreſſed. And accordingly we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which followeth; <hi>it ſtirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth;</hi> to wit, that <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>the grave</hi> had ſtirred up all the dead under his power to reſiſt him, or to entertain him honourably, or to deride and ſcoff at him; and amongſt the reſt, all the great Kings and Monarchs that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead; to wit, either as their King, all little enough to reſiſt him, or that the preſence of thoſe might contribute much to the honour of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, or becauſe thoſe great ones that had been ſlain by him, were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to inſult over him. And indeed obſervable it is, that in the laſt clauſe, <hi>it hath raiſed up from their thrones all the kings of the nations;</hi> by <hi>their thrones</hi> are meant their Sepulchers; or Royal Monuments, wherein their bodies lay inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or the Prophet ſpeaks of them in a Poetical way, as if they had thrones in the lower Region, as they had when they lived in the world; and that phraſe of their being <hi>raiſed up from their thrones,</hi> may ſeem to imply, that as Princes are wont to riſe up from their ſeats to ſome great Monarch, ſo ſhould theſe Kings riſe up from their graves before the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> as to him that had conquered them, their Lord and Soveraign. But ſtill all is ſpoken by way of deriſion and ſcorn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42788:88"/>Ver. 10. <hi>All they ſhall ſpeak, and ſay unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when the dead, even the chief among the dead before mentioned, that were ſtirred up to meet thee, or to reſiſt thee, or inſult over thee, ſhall ſee thee come naked and unarmed, not to ſubdue <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>the grave,</hi> but to be there in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with other dead people, they ſhall then ſay to thee, as in a way of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Art thou alſo become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, What! art thou come amongſt us? Is it poſſible! How ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou to die as others dye? Thou that wert feared by all Nations, as if thou hadſt been invincible, that wert extolled by thy Paraſites, as if thou hadſt been ſome Demi God, and that wert ready to adore thy ſelf, as ſomewhat more than a man, art thou at laſt found to be a poor mortal creature, as we were?</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noiſe of thy viols,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, all the pomp and glory, together with the delights and pleaſures wherein thou haſt lived, and wherein thou wert exalted far above others, is now laid in the duſt, and buried in the grave with thee. And it may well be alſo, that in the mention that is made of his <hi>Viols,</hi> there is ſome reſpect had to that mighty feaſt which <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> made for his Princes (that jollity whereof we may well think was accompanied with variety of muſick) at the very time when the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> was ſurpriſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.1. <hi>the worm is ſpread under thee, and the worms cover thee.]</hi> That is, maggots and worms ſhall be thy bed or carpets under thee, and thy coverlets over thee. Inſtead of a ſoft bed to lye upon, or of rapiſtry carpets, whereon thou wert wont to tread or ſit; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe rich and gorgeous coverlets, wherewith thou wert wont to cover thee, thou ſhalt have worms under thee, and worms above thee. Yet ſome there are that refer this wholly to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> being caſt forth without burial; to wit, that inſtead of being embalmed and wrapped up in ſere-clothes and fine linnen, as great Princes uſed to be, that their bodies might be preſerved from putrefaction, he ſhould be left to rot above ground, and to be eaten up of worms: Yea, ſome extend it to that of the worm that never dieth, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. And here I conceive is the end of the ſpeech of the dead to the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and that in the following <hi>verſe</hi> the Prophet proceeds on in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial taunting ſpeech or ſong, began <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer!</hi> &amp;c.] Or, <hi>O day-ſtar!</hi> ſee 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>ſon of the morning;</hi> that is, that art uſually the immediate fore-runner of the morning; and therefore alſo called <hi>the morning-ſtar,</hi> ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.28. becauſe this is the greateſt and brighteſt of all the ſtars (whence it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the beams of none of the ſtars do cauſe a ſhadow but this only; and that this is ſeen in the Firmament a while after the Sun-riſing, when none of the ſtars elſe can be ſeen), therefore to ſet forth, that the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch ſeemed to be advanced, as it were, to the very Heavens for his riches and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and did as far exceed all other Kings of the earth in ſplendor and Majeſty, as this did excel all the other ſtars in beauty and brightneſs; and that there ſeemed to be no more fear of his downfall, than there ſeemed to be of the falling of this day-ſtar out of the Heavens; therefore (I ſay) is the wonder of the fall of this great Monarch, or Monarchy, expreſſed in theſe terms, <hi>How
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42788:89"/>
art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, ſon of the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And to the ſame purpoſe are the following words, <hi>how art thou cut down to the ground,</hi> to wit, like ſome lofty tree, that being hewn down is laid along on the earth; <hi>which didſt weaken the nations?</hi> That is, oppreſs, waſte and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>For thou haſt ſaid in thine heart,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added as a reaſon of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> downfal; to wit, that it ſhould be for his proud exalting himſelf againſt the great God of Heaven: <hi>Thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I will aſcend into Heaven,</hi> that is, I will aſſume unto my ſelf the honour and glory due only to God; I will exalt my ſelf, as it is expreſſed in the following verſe, as one <hi>like the moſt High,</hi> as one that intended to fight againſt God: <hi>I will exalt my throne above the ſtars of God,</hi> that is, the higheſt or brighteſt ſtars, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.16. Or rather the ſtars of God's making, and which he hath ſet in the Heaven, the place of his own peculiar habitation. Now though theſe things may be ſaid of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch, (or Monarchy) with reſpect to any thought of his, wherein out of a preſumptuous conceit of his own wiſdom and power, he arrogated any thing to himſelf, above what could juſtly be aſcribed to man; as his affecting the univerſal Monarchy of the world, that he might have all Mankind under his command; and his requiring to be owned and worſhipped as a God, (in his image) <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.5. Yet I conceive they are principally ſpoken with reſpect to his proud reſolving to invade and ſubdue the Jews, Gods peculiar people, together with his Temple and Sanctuary, never minding the Almighty Power of God, whereby he heard they were defended, which was all one in effect, as if he had reſolved to ſubdue and dethrone God himſelf: And if thus we underſtand that which is ſaid here, then the following words may ſeem to be added by way of explaining theſe, <hi>I will ſit alſo upon the mount of the congregation, in the ſides of the North,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.2. That is, I will ſet my Throne upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> called here, <hi>The Mount of the Congregation,</hi> becauſe there God's people uſed to aſſemble themſelves together to meet with their God; as for the ſame reaſons the Tabernacle was of old called, <hi>The Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42. And hereby may be meant, either that he would aſſume the ſame honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which by the Jews was given to God in Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> or elſe rather, that he would bring <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> into ſubjection under him. And indeed <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> proud triumphing in this was the immediate fore-runner of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s ruin.

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Yet thou ſhalt be brought down to Hell,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, inſtead of climbing up to Heaven, thou ſhalt be caſt down to <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>the Grave.</hi> See a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, verſ. 9. <hi>To the ſides of the pit;</hi> as if it had been ſaid, Inſtead of ſitting upon Mount <hi>Sion in the ſides of the North,</hi> (for to that foregoing brag of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> verſ. 13. there is a clear Alluſion in this place) thou ſhalt be caſt down into the baſeſt room of the infernal Pit; or rather, into ſome obſcure corner of ſome common pit, digged upon ſome other occaſion; and that this ſhall
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42788:89"/>
be to thee inſtead of a Sepulcher. And indeed it is probable, that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was in the fury of the Surprize of <hi>Babylon</hi> thus caſt out amongſt others that were ſlain, without any decent burial.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>They that ſee thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be underſtood either of the living, that ſhould behold the <hi>Babylonians</hi> carcaſe ſo caſt out, as is beforeſaid; or elſe of the dead, as formerly; ver. 13. that ſhould gaze upon him, when he came among them. <hi>They that ſee thee, ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee;</hi> that is, they ſhall look wiſtly upon thee, to wit, as wondring at his great, and ſudden, and unexpected fall, doubting whether it were he or no, and ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their own eyes: <hi>Saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,</hi> that raiſed an earthquake, as it were, throughout the world, <hi>that did ſhake King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?</hi> to wit, by the terrors, the troubles, the ruins and alterations which he brought upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>That made the world as a wilderneſs, and deſtroyed the Cities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that laid all waſte where he came, ſlaughtering the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, or carrying them into Captivity, and burning up the houſes where they dwelt: <hi>That opened not the houſe of his priſoners,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane he was, that he would never ſuffer his priſoners to ſtir out of the Priſon-doors, though with Shackles about their heels. But rather the cruelty of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> here intended is, that he would never releaſe thoſe whom he had once caſt into Priſon; either he would ſlay them, or elſe damn them to perpetual Impriſonment. And therefore ſome read this place, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>That did not let his priſoners looſe homeward;</hi> that is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet his priſoners free, that they might go away to their own homes: which may be ſaid with ſpecial reſpect to the Jews, that could never get to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and ſent back to their own Country, till the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and deſtroyed <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>All the Kings of the Nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own houſe.]</hi> That is, the Kings of all Nations are ordinarily laid up in ſtately Tombs and Sepulchers, which they had before-hand provided for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or which belonged of old to their Families, and where their Anceſtors were buried; which uſually were in their own lands or poſſeſſions. See the Notes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1. and 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>But thou art caſt out of thy grave,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thy dead body ſhall be caſt out amongſt the carcaſes of other mean men, and ſhall never be honourably laid up in that Sepulcher which thou preparedſt for thy ſelf, and wherein thou hopedſt to lye amongſt thy Progenitors; <hi>like an abominable branch,</hi> that is, like ſome fruitleſs baſe plant, which men are wont to grub up; or like ſome branch of a tree, which as being dead, and withered, and hurtful to the tree (as are the ſuckers eſpecially that ſprout out from the root), men do therefore cut off and caſt away; or which being pruned away, as good for nothing, are ſuffered to lye rotting upon the ground, till they become ſo loathſom, that no body will care to touch them: <hi>And as the raiment of thoſe that are ſlain, thruſt through with a Sword;</hi> that is, the garment of one ſlain in the battel, that is ſo cut and mangled, and beſmeared with blood, that it is thence-forth good for nothing, neither will any man ſcarce vouchſafe to touch it, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42788:90"/>
therefore they caſt it away together with the carcaſe, whereon it was found; which is that the Prophet intends in the following words, <hi>That go down to the ſtones of the pit;</hi> that is, which ſlain men (together with their garments) are unſtript, caſt into the bottom of any pit that is near at hand, where ſtones lye ſcattered here and there; or upon which (the dead being laid there) they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward caſt a heap of ſtones: <hi>As a carcaſs trodden under foot,</hi> that is, ſome ſtinking carrion, or the carcaſe of a man, which out of hatred, or in the heat and fury of war, is not only left to lye and rot above ground, but is ſo trampled upon, bruiſed and broken, that no man well can, or much leſs will undertake the burying of it. And all this is thus expreſſed, to ſhew how abominable the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſhould be unto all men for his Pride and Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be joyned with them in burial,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou ſhalt not have that honour done thee in thy burial, which other Kings of the Nations have uſually done for them, (for this is ſpoken with reference to that which was ſaid before, ver. 18.) Thou ſhalt not be laid in ſuch a ſtately Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre amongſt thy Progenitors, nor be carried thereto with that Pomp and Solemnity, as other Kings uſe to be; <hi>becauſe thou haſt deſtroyed thy land, and ſtain thy people,</hi> to wit, the land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his ſubjects there. For though ſome would have this to be underſtood of the land and people which he had made his by Conqueſt; and others that underſtand it of his Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, do withal hold, that he is ſaid to have deſtroyed this his land, and to have ſlain his people, only becauſe by his wickedneſs he had provoked God to deſtroy them; yet I rather conceive that this it is that is here intended, as a great aggravation of his Tyranny, that not content with the ruin that he brought upon other Kingdoms and Nations; he did likewiſe deſtroy his own Land, and his own people, to wit, by the ſore burdens and exactions wherewith he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, and by the cruelties he exerciſed amongſt them, as bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are wont to do.</p>

See the Note <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. They ſhall by degrees be cut off, ſo that at laſt there ſhall not be one left to be called by their name, neither ſhall there be any mention made of them. And this, though delivered in general terms, is here inſerted with relation to <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> and his wicked Progenitors, as a reaſon why he was cut off, and after him all his poſterity too, as is farther threatned in the following Verſes.</p>

depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their ſhoulders:</hi> that is, then ſhall the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> yoke be taken from off my people. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.27. Some indeed hold, that it is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> that is here called the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> (See the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.22.) to wit, becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire was tranſlated to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> when they ſubdued the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and becauſe when the <hi>Babylonian</hi> invaded the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> his Army conſiſted chiefly of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who were then under his command, and neareſt to <hi>Judea,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of whoſe old quarrel againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> it may well be that he took occaſion to invade them. But this cannot be; for it is clear, that the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> was broken by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not in Gods land, and upon his mountains, as it is here ſaid the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould be. Rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this which is here ſaid concerning the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is inſerted, both to confirm again that which he had before foretold, concerning the ruin of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and his Army, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.33, 34, and likewiſe that hereby that which he had now alſo foretold concerning the ruin of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> might be the more readily believed; this being all one, as if he had ſaid, As I will now ſhortly deſtroy <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> when he ſhall invade you, ſo will I in time to come deſtroy the <hi>Babylonian</hi> too, as I have now told you: And this your firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> ſhall be a ſign to you of your future deliverance from the <hi>Babylonian.</hi> Yea, ſome Expoſitors conceive, that the foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> was delivered by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> and then indeed the deſtruction of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib, the Aſſyrian,</hi> could be here mentioned only to aſſure them, that as he had already deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and delivered them from his yoke, ſo he would alſo deſtroy the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> as he had now foretold, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from their bondage under him; or that as he had begun to deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> under <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> ſo he would quite deſtroy them when they were under the command of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and that Empire ſhould alſo be ruined, as the Prophet had now foretold. And this they judg the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe in the days of <hi>Ahaz</hi> there was yet no cauſe of fearing the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian.</hi> But this is altogether uncertain: and for this ſee the following Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>This is the purpoſe that is purpoſed upon the whole earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, this which I have now foretold, is that which ſhall come upon that great <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire that ſhall have the whole earth in a manner under their command: <hi>and this is the hand that is ſtretched out upon all the nations;</hi> to wit, the nations that are in ſubjection to <hi>Babylon.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.11. And this therefore ſeems to be added to aſſure Gods people of the truth of that which had been now foretold concerning the ruin of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, however incredible it might ſeem to them.

Now becauſe <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> (or rather the ſtate of <hi>Judah</hi> under <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>) had in his days ſorely ſmitten this Land and People of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6. (concerning which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 15.3.) and becauſe this <hi>rod of him that ſmote them,</hi> that is, the power of the ſtate of <hi>Judah,</hi> was very much broken, weakned and brought down in the days of his wicked grand-child <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when both the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and divers other Nations had mightily ſubdued them, and made great havock in their land, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.17, 18, 19. (concerning which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.7.) and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> might hope it was utterly in a manner ruined and broken, when <hi>Ahaz</hi> was dead, (for then there was no longer any fear, leſt he, by the help of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate, the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> ſhould ſeek to be revenged on thoſe Nations that had invaded his land; and of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his Son, who was young and tender, there was no great fear) therefore it is moſt probable, that this people of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> did indeed mightily rejoyce and triumph all the land over, when they heard <hi>Ahaz</hi> was dead, as being fully perſwaded, that now they ſhould quite ſwallow up the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> and hereupon it is that the Prophet ſpeaks this, as in a way of deriding the jollity of the Philiſtines, <hi>Rejoice not thou, Paleſtina, becauſe the rod of him that ſmote thee is broken;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Alas! thy jollity will be ſoon turned into bitter mourning, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thy miſeries, even all thy land over; <hi>For out of the Serpents root ſhall come forth a Cockatrice,</hi> (or, <hi>an adder;</hi>) That is, out of the ſtock of <hi>Uzziah</hi> (who did bite or ſting thee, as a Serpent) I will raiſe up <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Son of his Grandchild <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who ſhall be a ſorer plague to thee, than ever <hi>Uzziah</hi> was, even by how much <hi>a Cockatrice</hi> is worſe than a Serpent; yea he ſhall be worſe to thee than ſo, which is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>And his fruit ſhall be a fiery flying Serpent,</hi> concerning which ſee the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.6.

And obſervable is the expreſſion, <hi>Thou whole Paleſtina art diſſolved,</hi> as in reference to what was ſaid before, ver. 29. <hi>Rejoyce not thou whole Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina;</hi> for hereby is implied, that their dread and deſolation ſhould be as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as before their joy and triumph was. <hi>For there ſhall come from the North a ſmoak;</hi> that is, from <hi>Judea,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which partly lay North-eaſt from <hi>Gaza</hi> and other Cities in <hi>Paleſtina) Hezekiah</hi> ſhall break in upon you with a mighty Army; which is termed <hi>a ſmoak,</hi> becauſe as a black, thick, ſtifling ſmoak, that ariſeth upon the kindling of ſome great fire, cannot be kept out, but fills all places where it comes, and darkens the air, and doth exceedingly vex and annoy men, and drive them out of the places of their abode, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42788:92"/>
breaks out at laſt into a devouring flame; ſo ſhould this Army of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s break in unreſiſtably upon them, and overſpread the whole land, overwhelming them with the darkneſs of extreme miſery and terror, and ſetting the whole land by degrees on a light flame: <hi>And none ſhall be alone in his appointed times,</hi> or <hi>aſſemblies;</hi> that is, the people ſhall not come in ſingly one by one, but in whole Companies and Troops, at the ſet times, or the ſet places appointed for their aſſembling together; ſo readily and cheerfully ſhall they joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in this his expedition for the invading of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> Yet ſome would have the meaning to be, that no man ſhould withdraw himſelf from this ſervice, and through faint-heartedneſs ſtay alone at home.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer the meſſengers of the nation?</hi> &amp;c.] Either the word <hi>nation</hi> muſt be here collectively taken, <hi>nation</hi> for <hi>nations; What ſhall one then anſwer the meſſengers of the nations?</hi> And then the meaning may be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. That when Embaſſadors ſhould be ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to congratulate this great victory of theirs over the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> or when meſſengers ſhould be ſent to <hi>Judea</hi> upon any other occaſion, and coming thither, ſhould enquire of the late overthrow of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> the anſwer that ſhould be returned in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> to theſe <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers of the Nations,</hi> ſhould be, <hi>that the Lord hath founded Zion;</hi> that is, that he had built it, and appointed it to be the place where he would dwell amongſt his people; and that accordingly he would protect and eſtabliſh it for ever. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.69. and 87.1. <hi>and that the poor of his people ſhall truſt in it;</hi> that is, they ſhall account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe they ſhall be under Gods protection therein. And the meaning is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould anſwer the Embaſſadors, or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Nations, that by this which God had done to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> it was evident, that God had undertaken to eſtabliſt and defend <hi>Zion;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his enemies muſt needs be deſtroyed. Or 2. That when the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, or Meſſengers of the Nations returning home from <hi>Judea</hi> to their own Countries (and it may be extended to any ſtrangers that had been there), ſhould relate what a wonderful victory the <hi>Jews</hi> had gotten over the <hi>Philistines,</hi> every one there ſhould be ready to anſwer, that ſurely <hi>the Lord hath founded Zion,</hi> &amp;c. And if thus we underſtand the words, it is all one in effect, as if it had been ſaid, What think ye will be the report that will be ſpread all the world over, concerning this great overthrow of the <hi>Philistines</hi> by <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> Why truly, that God hath engaged himſelf for the protecting and preſerving of <hi>Zion;</hi> and that therefore his people, even when they are brought to the pooreſt condition, may well rely upon her ſafety. But now by <hi>the Meſſengers of the Nation</hi> may be meant, the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the Nation ſpoken of in the foregoing verſes: And then the meaning ſeems to be this, that in caſe the <hi>Philistines</hi> ſhould, upon the death of <hi>Ahaz</hi> (ſuppoſing <hi>Judah</hi> then to be in a weak condition), ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with many proud demands, denouncing War againſt him if thoſe demands were not granted; or rather, if after their defeat they ſhould ſend to deſire peace of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but yet upon very unequal and unreaſonable terms; the anſwer which <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or ſome other for him, ſhould return to theſe Meſſengers of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> would be this, <hi>that the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people ſhall trust in it,</hi> or <hi>ſhall betake themſelves unto it;</hi> to wit, as a place of refuge and ſafety.</p>

It may well be, that both the one and the other are here intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe in the night,</hi> &amp;c.] And ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly, when they were ſecure and fearleſs, and muſt be needs ſtruck with the greater terror; <hi>Ar of Moab</hi> (ſee the Notes <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.28 and <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>is laid waſte and brought to ſilence,</hi> that is, the inhabitants thereof are deſtroyed and ſlain (See the Note 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9.) or the Place thereof is deſtroyed and left deſolate. And beſides, in this expreſſion of her being <hi>brought to ſilence,</hi> there may be a cloſe intimation of the juſt hand of God upon her, in that her inhabitants, that had wont to let looſe their tongues to blaſpheme the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over, abuſe, and deride his people, ſhould then have their mouths ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. But this clauſe may be read, as it is in the margin, <hi>Ar of Moab is laid waſte and cut off,</hi> that is, not only ſpoiled and plundered, but alſo utterly ruined and deſtroyed; <hi>becauſe in the night Kir of Moab is laid waſte and brought to ſilence;</hi> and this was another chief City of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> called here haply <hi>Kir of Moab,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from another City of that name in <hi>Media,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9. but elſewhere <hi>Kir-hereſeth</hi> and <hi>Kirhareſh,</hi> Chap. 16.7, 11.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places to weep.]</hi> That is, the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the people of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſhall in this their great diſtreſs go up to their high places at <hi>Bajith,</hi> and <hi>Dibon,</hi> and elſewhere, to bewail their miſery before their Idol-Gods (<hi>Chemoſh</hi> eſpecially, ſee the Note <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.29.) and with much weeping and howling, and many ſacrifices offered, to cry to them for help and defence. And this is added by way of deriding their folly in ſteeing thus, ſome to one high place, and ſome to another; and perhaps in running from one God, and from one altar to another for relief and ſuccor, when alas, neither the one nor the other were able to help them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moab ſhall howl over Nebe, and over Medeba,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, for the miſeries already come upon theſe Cities, or ready to come upon them.

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>In their ſtreets they ſhall gird themſelves with ſackcloth,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.24. <hi>On the tops of their houſes, and in their ſtreets every one ſhall howl, weeping abundantly;</hi> that is, within their doors and without, there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weeping and howling. <hi>The tops of their houſes</hi> (concerning which, ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8.) are mentioned, becauſe thither they might flee, to get as far as they could from the enemy; or that thence they might ſee what the enemy did in the ſtreets; or becauſe thither they were wont to go up to pray, and to cry to heaven for help, as it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.29. that on their <hi>roofs they offered incenſe, unto Baal,</hi> and <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. That they worſhipped <hi>the hoſt of heaven on the houſe-tops.</hi> As for thoſe laſt words, <hi>weeping abundantly,</hi> it is in the Hebrew, <hi>deſcending into weeping,</hi> or, <hi>coming down with weeping;</hi> and that which is intended thereby, ſeems to be either, that they were diſſolved into weeping, or that their eyes ran down with tears; or rather, that as they went up to their high places, and to the tops of their houſes to weep, ſo they came down again weeping, not finding any hope of help or Comfort there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And Heſhbon ſhall cry, and Elealeh,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe places were alſo formerly in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Numb. 32.57. but were, it ſeems, in after-times, gotten from them by the <hi>Moabites: Their voice ſhall be heard even unto Jahaz,</hi> a Town in the utmoſt border of <hi>Moab,</hi> Numb. 21.23. ſo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is implyed, either that there ſhould be an out-cry of the people all the land over, or how lamentable their out-cry ſhould be, in that it ſhould be heard ſo far off; <hi>therefore the armed ſoldiers of Moab ſhall cry out,</hi> that is, the ſoldiers themſelves ſhall be ſo perplexed and terrified with the howling of the people, that even they alſo inſtead of fighting, ſhall cry out with the reſt; <hi>his life,</hi> that is, the life of each man of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> or of the armed ſoldiers, <hi>ſhall be grievous unto him,</hi> they ſhall be all weary of their lives. Yet ſome would have theſe words imply, that every man ſhould be afflicted for his own danger, not minding his neareſt Relations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>My heart ſhall cry out for Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] Some take theſe to be the words of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> or of the armed men of <hi>Moab</hi> (mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe) profeſſing how heartily they were grieved for the miſery that was come upon their poor Country; and that hereby is implied, how lamentable a ſight it would be, to ſee ſuch a goodly Country lay deſolate. But the moſt of Expoſitors, take them to be the words of the Prophet, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Though the <hi>Moabites</hi> be enemies, yet my very heart is troubled for them, and I cannot but mourn inwardly, when I think of the cruel and dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that is coming upon them. And this ſeems the more probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find the very ſame thing in a manner, ſpoken concerning the <hi>Moabites,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 48.31. <hi>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab.</hi> And again, verſe 36. <hi>Therefore mine heart ſhall ſound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart ſhall ſound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres.</hi> And of this ſorrow and mourning the reaſon ſeems to be given in the following words, <hi>his fugitives ſhall flee unto Zoar,</hi> that is, thoſe of the <hi>Moabites</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42788:94"/>
to eſcape the rage of their enemies, ſhall flee unto <hi>Zoar,</hi> there to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves; or that from thence they might flee out of the Land. And indeed, if <hi>Zoar</hi> ſtood in the utmoſt borders of <hi>Moab</hi> (as ſome ſay it did) it is like that this laſt is hinted thereby. And then for the following words, <hi>an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of three years old,</hi> thereby is meant an heifer that is in her prime, as at thoſe years they uſe to be fat and luſty, and ſtrong, and fair, and wanton, and never yet brought under the yoke. And this ſome apply to <hi>Zoar</hi> as holding that ſhe is compared to <hi>an heifer of three years old,</hi> either to imply, that this City, however little at firſt, was become by degrees, a place of much ſtrength and beauty, that had never yet been ſubdued, and that this was the cauſe why the <hi>Moabites</hi> fled thither for refuge; or elſe to imply, that her inhabitants had lived as a wanton Heifer, in great plenty and pleaſure, and had never ſeen ſorrow, though then ſhe ſhould ſhare in the miſery that was come upon the whole Country. And indeed, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.34. it ſeems to be <hi>Zoar,</hi> that is there compared to an Heifer of three years old; <hi>from Zoar, even unto H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ronaim, as an heifer of three years old.</hi> And ſome alſo apply it to <hi>Moab,</hi> or the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Moab;</hi> and ſo apprehend the meaning to be, that though <hi>Moab</hi> had hitherto lived in great abundance and wantonneſs, and had never been brought under the yoke of her enemies, like a young heifer, yet then ſhe ſhould flee before her enemies, even to <hi>Zoar;</hi> or elſe, that they ſhould flee to <hi>Zoar,</hi> as a young Heifer is wont to run from one place to another when ſhe wants any thing, lowing and crying out as ſhe runs. Thus, I ſay, this difficult paſſage may be underſtood as it is rendered in our Tranſlation. But now if we read it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tranſlation that is ſet in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>My heart ſhall cry out for Moab to the borders thereof, unto Zoar, even as an heifer of three years old;</hi> then the meaning ſeems to be, that <hi>his heart</hi> ſhould cry out aloud, after the lowing of a luſty ſtrong Heifer, ſo that it ſhould be heard, even to <hi>Zoar,</hi> which was in the borders of <hi>Moab.</hi> And taking theſe to be the words of the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> ſoldiers, as is before ſaid, then that which ſome ſay, may be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, That they ſhould cry aloud to the flying <hi>Moabites,</hi> to ſtay and defend the ſtrong places in the borders of <hi>Moab;</hi> and that their crying with ſo loud voice, as a luſty ſtrong heifer, was, becauſe otherwiſe their voice would not have been heard in the midſt of that out-cry and howling that was amongſt the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping ſhall they go it up,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, as they go up this high hill, they ſhall cry and weep all the way as they go. And to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>for in the way of Horonaim</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which place, ſee the Note <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>they ſhall raiſe up a cry of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> that is, they ſhall cry out as people uſe to do, when enemies are killing and deſtroying them. And this is here added, as ſome think, to ſhew why the ſoldiers ſhould cry out with ſuch a loud voice for the ſtaying of the people, as is ſaid in the foregoing Note. But I rather think, that the drift of it, is to ſet forth, that as the people fled to the mountains, or as they fled to <hi>Zoar;</hi> or that all the land over, all places ſhould be filled with weeping and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:42788:94"/>Ver. 6. <hi>For the waters of Nimrim ſhall be deſolate,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.3. The meaning is, that even <hi>Nimrim,</hi> though a place ſo gallantly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and therefore exceeding pleaſant, and fruitful, and populous, ſhould lye utterly deſolate, both the Inhabitants and their cattel being either ſlain or carried away. <hi>For the hay is withered away;</hi> that is, the graſs, which ſhould have grown up for hay: <hi>The graſs faileth,</hi> that is, the herbage newly grown up: <hi>There is no green thing,</hi> to wit, becauſe the Paſtures ſhould be quite ſpoiled, as being either eaten up by the enemies horſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> trampled into the mire with their feet. This I conceive to be the true meaning of this place; and that this is added, to imply what juſt cauſe there ſhould be of that general out-cry in the land, foretold in the foregoing Verſes. Yet becauſe this which is ſaid here, That there ſhould be no green thing, ſeems to be added with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that which went before, <hi>for the waters of Nimrah ſhall be deſolate;</hi> Therefore ſome hold, that by the deſolation of the waters of <hi>Nimrah,</hi> is meant that the waters of <hi>Nimrim</hi> ſhould by the enemy be diverted elſewhere in other channels, and ſo the land thereabouts ſhould become dry and barren. And others again would have the meaning of the whole verſe to be only this, That by the deſtruction which the enemy ſhould make amongſt the Inhabitants, even the rich paſtures and land about <hi>Nimrim</hi> ſhould lye as deſolate, as if there were neither waters nor graſs growing there for the uſe of them that ſhould dwell in that place.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, ſhall they carry away to the brook of the willows.]</hi> Firſt, this may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, either of the inhabitants of <hi>Nimrim,</hi> (mentioned in the foregoing verſe) that they, becauſe there was no water nor paſture there, ſhould remove their cattel and other goods to ſome well-watered grounds elſewhere, called <hi>The brook of the willows;</hi> or elſe of the <hi>Moabites</hi> in general, That they, when the enemy ſhould break in with ſuch rage upon them, ſhould carry away what they could of the great riches which they had ſtored up, and hide it in ſome obſcure place amongſt the Willows, or it may be in the very River it ſelf; to wit, ſo much of it as might be kept there without damage, in hope afterwards to find it there again; and that becauſe there was no place of ſtrength in the land, where they could hope to ſecure it from the enemy. But, Secondly, it may rather be underſtood of the enemy; to wit, that they ſhould carry away the abundance and mighty ſpoil, which they had gotten from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> to ſome place in or near to the land of <hi>Moab,</hi> called, <hi>The brook of the willows,</hi> and there to leave it together under ſome guard, with a purpoſe afterward to go thither again, when they had done pillaging the Country, and to divide the booty amongſt themſelves. Yea, and ſome that underſtand this of the enemies carrying away the riches of <hi>Moab</hi> to <hi>the brook of the willows,</hi> do yet think that the foregoing words, <hi>The abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up,</hi> muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> and ſo would have the meaning of the place to be this, that though the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſhould get in all the wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion they could, that they might be the better able to hold it out in their ſtrong places againſt their enemies, when they ſhould beſiege them; yet their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould break in upon them, and empty all their Store-houſes, and carry
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42788:95"/>
all away with them: Or, that though the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſhould hide in abundance ſo much of the beſt of their wealth and treaſures, as they could poſſibly get together, at leaſt of that which was left; yet their enemies ſhould find it, ſeize upon it, and carry it away to <hi>the brook of the willows.</hi> And beſides, becauſe the words which are rendred in our Bibles, <hi>The brook of the willows,</hi> may be tranſlated, as it is in the Margin, <hi>The valley of the Arabians;</hi> therefore the meaning may be, either that the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſhould carry away the ſpoil of the <hi>Moabites</hi> Country, either as ſerving under the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians;</hi> or as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards entring the land, to pillage and carry away what the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians</hi> had left: or elſe, that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhould carry away the prey they had gotten from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> to <hi>the valley of the Arabians;</hi> their Confederates, there to be kept a while by them, intending afterwards to convey them from thence into their own Countrey. But however clear it is, that this is mentioned as one cauſe of the great outcry in the land of <hi>Moab,</hi> of which the Prophet is here ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe grievous miſeries that ſhall come upon the <hi>Moabites,</hi> there ſhall be a dreadful outcry amongſt them all the land over, both of them that are ſlain, and of them that flee from the enemy: <hi>The howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim;</hi> that is, the howling of this cry ſhall reach unto theſe places. See the Notes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>For the waters of Dimon ſhall be full of blood,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, with the blood of the ſlaughtered <hi>Moabites:</hi> So that this is alſo added as a reaſon of that great out-cry before ſpoken of, that ſhould be in the land. Whether <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> be the name of a River, or of a City, is altogether uncertain; for we find it no where elſe mentioned. However it ſeems that there was in this place ſome greater ſlaughter made amongſt the people, than in any other part of the land; either becauſe they here ſtood out longeſt in the defence of ſome place againſt the enemy; or for ſome reaſon that is not expreſſed. And ſome think that <hi>Dimon</hi> is the ſame City that was before, ver. 2. called <hi>Dibon,</hi> the name being changed, and of <hi>Dimon</hi> called <hi>Dibon,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>bloody,</hi> upon that occaſion. Yea and very many learned Expoſitors hold, that there is an Alluſion in theſe words to the Story in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.20, 21, 23. concerning a ſtream of water that came running down from the land of <hi>Edem</hi> into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where there was an Army of three Kings that were going againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> which appeared to the <hi>Moabites</hi> to be blood, and were afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed died red with their blood; as if the Prophet would have ſaid, That as then the ſtream was onee before died with blood, ſo it ſhould be again: Whereas to me it ſeems more than probable, that the waters mentioned in that place were miraculouſly ſent of God for the refreſhing of thoſe Armies, and were not the waters of a River that did conſtantly run thorow that Wilderneſs. And therefore for thoſe following words, <hi>For I will bring more</hi> (it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>additions) upon Dimon;</hi> I do not think the meaning of that is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe waters were made red with blood at that time, when thoſe three Kings ſlew the <hi>Moabites;</hi> now there ſhould be <hi>more</hi> blood there, becauſe the ſlaughter of the <hi>Moabites</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> ſhould be far greater than that formerly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42788:95"/>
was by thoſe three Kings. The meaning of thoſe words rather is; either, 1. That God would add ſtreams of blood to the waters of <hi>Dimon,</hi> which running into it from ſeveral places, ſhould make the river riſe and ſwell more and more. Or, 2. that God would bring more and greater vengeance upon <hi>Dimon,</hi> than upon other parts of the land; the ſlaughter ſhould be greater there, and ſo more blood ſhould be ſhed there, than in any other place beſides. Or, 3. that God would bring more evils upon <hi>Dimon,</hi> than what he had hitherto ſpoken of, concerning the ſpoiling of their paſtures, and the plundering of their goods, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. even this here mentioned, the ſhedding of their blood in ſo great abundance: yea (ſay ſome) more than that here mentioned, to wit, that after the miſeries brought upon them by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhould alſo in proceſs of time utterly deſtroy them. Or, 4. That to the judgment here threatned, that <hi>the waters of Dimon ſhall be full of blood,</hi> he would add yet <hi>more;</hi> to wit, the judgment ſet forth in the following words, <hi>Lions upon him that eſcapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land;</hi> which though ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of men fierce and ſavage as <hi>Lions,</hi> as namely the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> or the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> who though he was only as a Bear to other parts of <hi>Moab,</hi> yet he would be as a Lion to <hi>Dimon:</hi> Yet I rather think it is to be underſtood literally, to wit, that thoſe <hi>Moabites</hi> that had eſcaped the Sword, and were left in the land, ſhould be ſlain by Lions, (and other wild beaſts) to wit, either in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whither they ſhould flee to eſcape the Sword; or in their own land, which lying deſolate, Lions ſhould breed in it, as it was with the Colonies in <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 King. 17.25.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>SEnd ye the Lamb to the Ruler of the land, from Sela to the wilderneſs, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.]</hi> There are only two Expoſitions of this place, which can conſiſt with our Tranſlation. The firſt is, that by <hi>the Lamb</hi> here is meant a Sacrifice of Atonement, which the <hi>Moabites</hi> are here ſtirred up to ſend to the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Only there is this difference amongſt thoſe that do thus conceive of <hi>the Lamb</hi> to be ſent, 1. That ſome think the Prophet doth here ſeriouſly adviſe the <hi>Moabites</hi> to ſend Lambs and other ſuch like cattel, to be offered up in Sacrifice to God, the Ruler of the whole world, at the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to pacifie God's diſpleaſure againſt them. And 2. that others take it to be Ironically ſpoken, and by way of inſulting over the <hi>Moabites;</hi> as if he had ſaid, You that had wont to deſpiſe and blaſpheme
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42788:96"/>
the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now that you ſee your ſelves in ſuch deſperate danger; now that you are ſo miſerably deſtroyed, you had beſt ſend your Sacrifices to the Ruler of the world at the Temple in Mount <hi>Zion:</hi> But alas, if you had a mind to do ſo, it is now, you ſee, too late. But then the (2.) is, that by <hi>the Lamb,</hi> which the <hi>Moabites</hi> are here adviſed <hi>to ſend to the Ruler of the land,</hi> is meant the Tribute which they were wont to pay to the King of <hi>Judah;</hi> Becauſe it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the <hi>Moabites</hi> were ſubdued by <hi>David,</hi> and became Tributaries to him. See the Notes, 2 Sam. 8.2. And it is moſt probable, that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute agreed upon was that which is mentioned 2. King. 3.4. <hi>An hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Lambs, with an hundred thouſand Rams, with the wool:</hi> which it ſeems they paid duly to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after that Kingdom was divided from the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> till after the death of <hi>Ahab,</hi> when they refuſed to pay their Tribute any longer, either to <hi>Ahaziah</hi> or <hi>Joram</hi> his Son. See the Notes 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.1. and 35. Therefore it is thought the <hi>Moabites</hi> are here adviſed to pay their wonted Tribute again to the King of <hi>Judah, Send ye the Lamb,</hi> that is, the Tribute which you formerly paid of Lambs and other cattel, <hi>to the Ruler of the Land;</hi> that is, to the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> to whom of right you are Vaſſals, ever ſince <hi>David</hi> ſubdued you: <hi>From Sela,</hi> ſome chief City in the South-borders of the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> which was afterwards taken by <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and called <hi>Joktheel,</hi> See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.7. <hi>To the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> that is the wilderneſs of <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the North-border: <hi>Unto the mount of the daughter of Zion,</hi> that is, to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> See the Note, Chap. 1.8. Which is all one therefore as if he had ſaid, Let all the people all the Land over, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up this Tribute and ſend it. But indeed many Expoſitors underſtand this as ſpoken in a way of deriſion, as if the Prophet had ſaid, You had beſt (to prevent the ruin that from <hi>Judah</hi> will be brought upon you) to ſend the old Tribute again you had wont to pay to <hi>Hezekiah, the Ruler of the land</hi> (and it is like in your ſtraits you will think of doing ſo) but alas it will do no good; that will not then keep off the deſtruction, which will certainly come upon you.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For it ſhall be, that as a wandring bird caſt out of the neſt,</hi> (or, as a neſt forſaken) <hi>ſo the daughters of Moab ſhall be at the fords of Arnon.]</hi> A river in the utmoſt borders of the land of <hi>Moab, Numb.</hi> 21.13. The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeems to be, that as <hi>a wandring bird,</hi> driven out of her neſt, or as a brood of young birds, forſaken of their damme, or caſt out of their neſt, do fly up and down, not having any body to protect them, not knowing whither to go, or where to take up their reſt; ſo <hi>the daughters of</hi> Moab, that is, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Towns of <hi>Moab,</hi> or the Moabitiſh women, (ſee Chap. 3.16, 17. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.34. even they, as well as the men, ſhall flee away out of their Country, and wander up and down in deſart places, not knowing where to ſettle themſelves: Or, they ſhall be carried away captives into <hi>Aſſyria</hi> over the River <hi>Arnon.</hi> But now we muſt know, that this may be taken as ſpoken only conditionally, to wit, that thus it ſhould be with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> if they did not hearken to the advice given them in the foregoing verſe. But others, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, as ſpoken <hi>Ironically,</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly underſtand this as added to ſhew why there would be no thinking
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42788:96"/>
to ſend a Lamb, either by way of pacifying God's anger by Sacrifices, or by way of procuring their Peace, by paying their former Tribute; becauſe inſtead of that, they ſhould flee in great dread from the Sword of the Enemy, or ſhould be carried away by the Enemy into Captivity, as eaſily as a bird is driven out of her neſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Take counſel,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, Conſult together how you may eſcape the deſtruction that is coming upon you. And they that do underſtand theſe firſt words thus, do accordingly hold, that in the next words the Prophet tells them what would be the beſt courſe they could take, if they deſired to prevent their approaching ruin; namely, to be courteous and kind to the out-caſts of God's people in their diſtreſs, <hi>Execute Judgment, make thy ſhadow as the night,</hi> &amp;c. But I rather conceive, that theſe firſt words do intend the ſame thing with thoſe that follow after; <hi>Take counſel,</hi> that is, Conſider with your ſelves, and conſult together; to wit, how you may any way protect, and relieve, and procure the good of my people in their affliction and diſtreſs: <hi>Execute judgment,</hi> that is, Do that for them, which in all Juſtice and Equity you ought to do; be not injurious to my people in their diſtreſſes, as you have formerly been; but ſhew them that compaſſion, which is due to a people in ſuch miſery: <hi>Make thy ſhadow as the night in the midſt of the noon-day;</hi> that is, when my people are driven out of their Country, and flee to you to ſhelter them from their enemies, let them be concealed and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by you, that even at Noon-day they may be as if they were covered with the darkneſs or ſhadow of the night, when no body can ſee them, or find them out; or rather, let the harbour and entertainment they find amongſt you, be as a ſafe and ſweet refuge and refreſhment, againſt the noon-day heat of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> breaking in upon them, even as the pillar of the cloud (to which haply this Expreſſion doth allude) was a covert to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heat of the Sun, as they travelled through the VVilderneſs to <hi>Canaan; hide the out-caſts, bewray not him that wandereth;</hi> that is, Hide thoſe, that being driven out of their own Land, wander up and down amongſt you, to ſeek for ſome place of ſhelter, and do not deliver them up into the hands of their enemies. But now all this is underſtood by many, as ſpoken Ironically; <hi>Take counſel, execute Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, Now when the enemy is broken in upon you, it may be you will wiſh you had done what it was indeed your duty to have done to Gods poor people, when they were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and purſued by their enemies. But alas, it is now too late; you had wont to reject them, and to deal cruelly with them at ſuch times; and now you will meet with the ſame hard meaſure.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Let mine outcaſts dwell with thee, Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thoſe of my people that are driven out of the land which I had given them, and that I own ſtill as my people, though I have at preſent in juſt diſpleaſure againſt them, caſt them out for their ſins; <hi>Be thou a covert to them from the face of the ſpoiler,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, As at the firſt bringing of my people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> you did diſcover your ſpleen againſt them, (See the Notes <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.4.) ſo you have done ever ſince, being ſtill ready to ſide with their enemies that have prevailed againſt them, and to deal hardly with them in their diſtreſs; but beware, do
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42788:97"/>
not ſo ſtill, but rather let them have a hiding-place amongſt you, to ſhelter them from the rage of their enemies, to wit, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as moſt Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do here conceive. But now the drift of all this is only to ſhew, what in all reaſon the <hi>Moabites</hi> ought to have done; and, as ſome think, to inſult over their deſtruction, becauſe they had not done ſo: <hi>for the Extortioner is at an end, the ſpoiler ceaſeth, the oppreſſors are conſumed out of the land;</hi> that is, the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> ſhall be quite freed from the enemy that came to ſpoil and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her, which, I ſay, moſt Expoſitors underſtand of the quick diſpatch that God made of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and his army, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. ſo that the drift of this paſſage ſeems to be this; that conſidering the calamity that was to come upon Gods people, was not like to laſt long, but that they ſhould be ſpeedily ſetled again peaceably in their own Land; the <hi>Moabites</hi> had no cauſe to reject the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they fled to them for ſhelter, as fearing leſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould be enraged againſt them for it; but rather might do well therein to gratifie the <hi>Jews,</hi> thereby to make them their friends for the time to come. And all this we muſt know, is ſpoken by way of inſulting over the <hi>Moabites</hi> in their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe they had not done that, which in all reaſon and equity they ſhould have done.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And in mercy ſhall the throne he eſtabliſhed,</hi> &amp;c.] Or, <hi>prepared.</hi> That is, However the Throne of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be dangerouſly ſhaken by the invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> which ſhall cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> to flee to thee, O <hi>Moab;</hi> yet it ſhall not be utterly overthrown and ruined; but through the mercy and free grace of God, it ſhall be eſtabliſhed and ſetled again in great ſtrength and power, for him to whom it belongs. Some, I know, underſtand thoſe words [in mercy] of the mercy of the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereby his Throne ſhould be eſtabliſhed for him, and for his Succeſſors. But I queſtion not, but that it is meant of Gods mercy to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> And thereupon it follows, <hi>and he ſhall ſit upon it in truth,</hi> &amp;c. which words muſt be underſtood, both of Chriſt, and of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> as he was a type of Chriſt. Underſtanding it of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> the meaning is, That he ſhould ſit upon the Throne of <hi>Judah in truth, i. e.</hi> certainly; or ſurely, firmly and conſtantly; or that he ſhould govern the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſincerely, and uprightly; <hi>in the Tabernacle of David,</hi> that is, in the houſe and palace of <hi>David; judging, and ſeeking Judgment, and haſtning Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, being careful to execute Judgment and Juſtice amongſt them without partiality, and without delay. But underſtanding it of Chriſt, who is indeed principally here intended; the meaning then is, That God would raiſe him up out of the Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> and that he ſhould ſit upon the Throne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for ever, (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.7.) protecting his people, and executing Judgment upon his and their enemies (ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5.) And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the drift of this paſſage ſeems to be; firſt, more particularly, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſetled in the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> it would be better for the <hi>Moabites</hi> to ſide with the <hi>Jews,</hi> than with the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And 2ly. more generally, that it was meer ſolly in the <hi>Moabites</hi> and others, to expect the ruine of the Throne and Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> upon every prevailing of their enemies againſt them; there being a King to ariſe in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42788:97"/>
of <hi>David,</hi> who ſhould ſit on that Throne, and ſhould juſtly govern and proſperouſly defend Gods people for ever.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>We have heard of the pride of Moab,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitors hold, that God ſpeaks here of himſelf in the Plural Number, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. for which, ſee the Note there. And others ſuppoſe, that this is ſpoken in the name of other people, alledging the pride of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> as a reaſon why it was no wonder to them to hear of their Deſtruction. But more generally it is thought by Expoſitors, that in this word <hi>[We]</hi> the Prophet doth include the Lord God himſelf, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all the neighbour Nations, and that it is all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, That the Pride of <hi>Moab</hi> was on all ſides well known; <hi>We have heard of the Pride of Moab (he is very proud) even of his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and his pride, and his wrath;</hi> that is, the wrath, which out of his great pride and haughtineſs he hath diſcovered againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> The full ſcope of this whole paſſage, may be thus expreſſed. Theſe things-whereto the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> have been here adviſed, verſe 1, 3, 4. they ought in all reaſon to have done; but alas, they are too proud to do any ſuch thing: we have heard of their proud boaſtings and threats. Becauſe they are a great and wealthy people, and their Country and Cities are very ſtrong, therefore they fear nothing; and inſtead of carrying themſelves to the people of God, according to the counſel before given them; they on the contrary, do in their pride deal deſpitefully and injuriouſly with them. But this their pride ſhall not ſecure them, but ſhall rather prove their ruine; which is implied in the following words, <hi>but his lies ſhall not be ſo,</hi> that is, their vain confidence, their proud boaſtings and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſhall prove but lies; that which they vainly and proudly conceit, and boaſt, and threaten, ſhall not come to paſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, becauſe of their horrid pride, <hi>Moab ſhall howl for Moab,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, the living <hi>Moabites</hi> ſhall howl for the dead; or rather, they ſhall mutually howl one to another, or one for another; ſo that, as it follows, <hi>every one ſhall howl,</hi> that is, there ſhall be a general how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the Land over; <hi>for the foundations of Kir-hareſeth</hi> (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>ſhall ye mourn,</hi> that is, not for the plundring or defacing of it, but for the utter ſubverting of it, and razing the very foundations of it; and the rather haply, becauſe ye thought them invinſible. This, indeed, may be read as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>for the foundations of Kir-hareſeth ſhall ye mutter.</hi> And they that read it ſo, conceive the meaning to be, That they ſhould mutter within themſelves, that ſeeing that Town had formerly ſtood out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſiege of three Kings, (for which, ſee the Note 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.25.) and was now in as good ſtrength as ever; therefore they ſhould be well enough able to defend it: and accordingly they hold, that in the following words, <hi>ſurely they are ſtricken,</hi> the vanity of theſe their hopes is diſcovered, in that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this their muttering, the foundations of this their ſtrong Town, were <hi>ſtricken,</hi> that is, overthrown or deſtroyed; or they that flattered themſelves thus, were <hi>ſtricken;</hi> that is, wounded or ſlain. But I conceive the former Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation to be far the beſt; and that in the laſt words the reaſon is given why they ſhould <hi>mourn for the foundations of Kir-hareſeth,</hi> namely, becauſe they ſhould <hi>ſurely</hi> be <hi>ſtricken,</hi> that is, razed and ruined.</p>

And ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hereby, that the Lords of the Heathen went on, waſting the Vineyards <hi>even unto Jazer,</hi> and ſo on to the Wilderneſs, &amp;c. as it followeth in the next words, becauſe ſo far that goodly track of Land was repleniſhed with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.

And why he would weep ſo bitterly for theſe places, he ſheweth in the following words, <hi>for the ſhouting for thy Summer-fruits, and for thy harveſt is fallen;</hi> that is, your wonted ſinging and ſhouting with a great deal of jollity at the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of your Harveſt and Vintage, is now ceaſed; to wit, becauſe your Corn and vines are ſpoiled by the enemies. But this clauſe now may be read as it is in the margin, <hi>for the alarm is fallen upon thy Summer-fruits, and upon thy Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, In Harveſt and Vintage-time the enemy ſhall break in upon you with a hideous ſhouting, (and indeed ſo it is expreſſed <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.32. <hi>The ſpoiler is fallen upon thy Summer-fruits, and upon thy Vintage</hi>) and that ſhall be inſtead of the joyful ſhouting that uſed to be in your fields at thoſe times; for if this laſt clauſe be thus tranſlated, yet that this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, is evident by the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And gladneſs is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field, and in the Vineyards there ſhall be no ſinging, neither ſhall there be ſhouting,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as at ſuch times of Harveſt and Vintage there uſed to be; ſee the Notes <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.27. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6. and that becauſe there ſhould be no Corn to reap, nor grapes to tread, the enemy having deſtroyed all, by reaſon of God's juſt wrath againſt them, as it is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>The treaders ſhall tread out no wine in their preſſes; I,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>have made their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage-ſhouting to ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Wherefore my bowels ſhall ſound like an harp for Moab, and mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts for Kir-hereſh.]</hi> See the foregoing Notes, ver. 9. and Chap. 15 ver. 1, and 5. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.36. it is expreſſed thus, <hi>Mine heart ſhall ſound for</hi> Moab <hi>likr pipes,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore this of the ſounding of his bowels and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, may be meant only of the deep ſighs and groans that came from his heart. Yet becauſe extremity of grief will many times cauſe a mans bowels to roll together, and ſo to rumble and make a noiſe within him, it may be meant of this, according to that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. where God ſaith of <hi>Ephraim, My bowels are troubled for him;</hi> which is in the Hebrew, <hi>my bowels do ſound for him.</hi> And there may be alſo an Alluſion to the old Cuſtom of uſing mournful Muſick, and ſinging doleful Songs, when they bewailed their dead Friends, or at any other time of great lamentation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when it is ſeen that</hi> Moab <hi>is weary on the high places,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when it is evident that the <hi>Moabites</hi> are even wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and tired out with ſeeking help of their Idol-gods, upon their high-places, the ordinary places where they uſed to ſerve them; to wit, partly by their running from one high place to another, and partly by their weeping and praying there, and the multitude of their Sacrifices which in each high place they offered up to their gods; but eſpecially by the fruitleſneſs of all theſe their endeavours, in that they can procure no help from their gods by all they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42788:100"/>
do: <hi>That he ſhall come to his Sanctuary to pray;</hi> to wit, ſome place reputed more holy than their ordinary high places, the Temple (as it is moſt probable) of their chief Idol <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> (See the Note, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.7.) whither they ſhall fly as their laſt refuge, and their chief Sanctuary in times of great diſtreſs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there at laſt to find ſome help and relief; <hi>But he ſhall not prevail,</hi> that is, even there alſo they ſhall loſe their labour, and ſhall not prevail with their god to come to their help. And this now is added in the cloſe of all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> as the height of their miſery; to wit, that when in their diſtreſs they ſhould ſeek to their gods for ſuccour, they ſhould be aſhamed and confounded, becauſe all would be loſt labour: the longer they wearied themſelves therein, the worſe things ſhould ſtill go with them. And indeed ſo this is expreſſed by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 48.13. <hi>And Moab ſhall be aſhamed of Chemoſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>This is the word that the Lord hath ſpoken concerning</hi> Moab <hi>ſince that time.]</hi> That is, this which hath hitherto been foretold concerning the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> is the word which God hath ſpoken, <hi>ſince that time,</hi> that the Judgment which God had paſſed againſt them, was firſt revealed to me. That which follows, ver. 14. was after revealed. Yet I do not ſee, but that theſe words may be the entrance into the following Prophecy, wherein the preciſe time is ſet down, when this deſtruction now threatned ſhould come upon the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</hi> Having largely related <hi>the burden of Moab,</hi> Chap. 15.1. that is, the Prophecy which God had revealed to him concerning the miſeries that were coming upon <hi>Moab;</hi> as in reference to that, now he adds <hi>This,</hi> that is, this Prophecy that followeth in the next verſe, <hi>is the word that the Lord hath ſpoken concerning Moab ſince that time;</hi> that is, ſince the revelation of the foregoing Prophecy.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>But now the Lord hath ſpoken, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, Since the time of the revelation of the foregoing Prophecy, God hath now further made known his Will concerning <hi>Moab; But now the Lord hath ſpoken, ſaying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab ſhall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant ſhall be very ſmall and feeble.</hi> That is, Three years hence, at the end of three years, the glory of <hi>Moab</hi> in the multitude of his people, wherein he now prideth himſelf, and whereon he relies with ſo much confidence, ſhall be brought very low, by the great deſtruction which their enemies ſhall make amongſt them. And as for thoſe words, <hi>As the years of an hireling,</hi> they are added to imply, that this Calamity ſhould come upon them preciſely at the end of three years, neither ſooner, nor later; even as an hireling goeth away from his Maſter, juſt at the expiring of the time for which he was hired; ſooner than that his Maſter will not let him go, and a day longer than that he will not ſtay: it being uſual with ſuch hired Servants earneſtly to long for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring of the time of their ſervices, for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Job.</hi> 7.1. and 14.5. The great queſtion is concerning the three years, the time prefixed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction here threatned. Indeed if we ſhould underſtand theſe words, <hi>within three years,</hi> as ſome do, of the ſpace of time that ſhould be ſpent by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the deſtroying of it, there would then be no difficulty in the words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42788:100"/>
they might be underſtood of any <hi>three years</hi> at any time whatſoever. But queſtionleſs the Prophet doth here determine the time, when <hi>Moab</hi> ſhould be waſted, as is here foretold, and that purpoſely for the encouragement of God's people, by letting them know, how ſoon this ruin ſhould come upon theſe their proud enemies the <hi>Moabites.</hi> And therefore too I cannot think, that this is meant, as ſome would have it, of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> deſtroying the <hi>Moabites,</hi> three years after he had deſtroyed <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is rather meant of the deſtruction of <hi>Moab</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> at leaſt principally of that, (ſee the Notes, Chap. 15.1.) And this is added as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophecy diſtinct from that, and revealed to the Prophet ſince that; and therefore muſt be meant of ſome deſtruction brought upon them by the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> three years after the promulgation of this Prophecy. Firſt therefore, Some hold that this was prophecied in the beginning of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign, and that it was fulfilled accordingly <hi>in the fourth year of</hi> Hezekiah, when <hi>Shalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer</hi> went againſt <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 King. 18.9. and ſo as he went thither, might ſubdue and deſtroy the <hi>Moabites,</hi> that he might not leave an enemy behind his back. Or elſe that this was foretold by the Prophet, when <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> did firſt beſiege <hi>Samaria,</hi> and that when he had taken <hi>Samaria,</hi> (which was after he had beſieged it <hi>three years,</hi> 2 Kin. 17.5.) he went againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and brought this calamity upon them, that is here foretold: which laſt ſeems of the two the moſt probable; becauſe thoſe foregoing paſſages, Chap. 16.3, 4. ſeem to upbraid the <hi>Moabites</hi> for their former inhumane dealing with God's people, when they fled to them for ſhelter; which may be meant of thoſe of the ten Tribes, that fled to them upon that invaſion of their land by <hi>Shalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer.</hi> Again 2ly, Some hold, that the Prophet foretold the deſtruction here threatned about the eleventh year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and it was executed upon the <hi>Moabites</hi> by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> when <hi>three years</hi> after, to wit, <hi>in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah,</hi> he invaded the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.13. to wit, that as he marched with his Army out of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> with a purpoſe to ſubdue <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he fell upon the <hi>Moabites</hi> by the way, (which might be, though <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> makes no particular mention of <hi>Moab</hi> amongſt the people whom his Maſter had vanquiſhed, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.34.) For indeed after the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it could not be, becauſe his Army was then ſo miraculouſly deſtroyed. And thirdly, Others think that this was threatned by the Prophet about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or fifteenth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and executed upon <hi>Moab</hi> about the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or eighteenth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and that by <hi>Ezarhaddon</hi> the Son of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> when he ſwept away the remainder of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were left in their land, and ſo might well deſtroy the <hi>Moabites</hi> at the ſame time; for which ſee the Note before, Chap. 7.8.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THe burden of Damaſcus,</hi> &amp;c.] The chief City of <hi>Syria,</hi> Chap. 7.8. So that under this the ruin of the whole Land of <hi>Syria</hi> is threatned. And ſee the Notes alſo, Chap. 13.1. and 2 King. 9.25. <hi>Behold, Damaſcus is taken away from being a City, and it ſhall be a ruinous heap.</hi> As if the Prophet ſhould have ſaid, How impoſſible ſoever it may ſeem to you, yet aſſure your ſelves the time ſhall come when you ſhall ſee that great <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> of which you are now ſo exceedingly afraid, to be made a very heap of ſtones and rubbiſh. When this was effected, it is hard to determine: We find that <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was taken and ſacked, and the Inhabitants carried into Captivity by <hi>Tiglath-Pileſer,</hi> in the days of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> See the Note, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 16.9. And indeed, becauſe in this place the deſtruction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is threatned together with the deſtruction of <hi>Syria,</hi> it may well be, that the intent of this Prophecy was to comfort the men of <hi>Judah</hi> againſt the invaſion of the two Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo much hath been ſpoken before, Chap. 7. But now if this was prophecied, as it is thought by moſt Expoſitors, in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> then it may be that <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was again taken, and totally ruined and deſtroyed by <hi>Shalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer,</hi> in that expedition of his, wherein he took <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.9. Or elſe by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> as he went againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.13. For we ſee before, Chap. 10.9. <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> as it is commonly thought, is brought in boaſting of the conqueſt of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> by him or his Father: And if the City were ſo ruined at that time, and the Inhabitants ſo ſlaughtered or carried away captives, that it ceaſed to be a City; yet certainly it was repaired and fortified again: And therefore we read of another deſtruction brought upon <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians, Jer.</hi> 49.23, &amp;c. And ſome think this is that which is here foretold by our Prophet.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>The Cities of Aroer are forſaken,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think this <hi>Aroer</hi> was a Country in <hi>Syria,</hi> near the River <hi>Arnon.</hi> But others more generally hold, that by <hi>the Cities of Aroer,</hi> here are meant the Cities in the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> without <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> near unto the City <hi>Aroer,</hi> which was ſcituated by the banks of the River <hi>Arnon.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.36. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.34. Only ſome hold that thoſe Cities were in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Syrians</hi> when this deſolation came upon them; and others ſay, that the Prophet here threatens the deſtruction of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> together with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> becauſe they ſhould be both deſtroyed together: However the meaning of that which is ſaid here, that theſe <hi>Citi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of Aroer</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:42788:101"/>
ſhould be <hi>forſaken,</hi> is, that they ſhould be left deſolate, the Inhabitants being ſlain, or carried away Captives by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> upon the invaſion of <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> or <hi>Shalmaneſer:</hi> Whereupon it followeth, <hi>They ſhall be for flocks, which ſhall lye down, and none ſhall make them afraid;</hi> to wit, becauſe the Inhabitants ſhould be all gone, and ſo there ſhould be no body to diſturb them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The fortreſs alſo ſhall ceaſe from Ephraim,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> being deſtroyed, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the ten Tribes (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.9.) ſhall loſe that which was wont to be their fortreſs and refuge; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wont in their dangers and troubles ſtill to fly to the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for defence and ſuccour. But I rather conceive that the Prophets intent here is to foretel, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> ſhould both be deſtroyed, that were ſo often joyned together againſt <hi>Judah. The fortreſs alſo ſhall ceaſe from Ephraim;</hi> that is, <hi>Samaria,</hi> and all other the ſtrong holds in the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, ſhall be ruined and deſtroyed: <hi>And the Kingdom from Damaſcus and from the remnant of Syria;</hi> that is, <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſhall ceaſe to be a Royal City, the ſeat of the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> nor ſhall the <hi>Syrians</hi> that are left after the ruine of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> be a Kingdom any longer, or have a King to reign over them, their King <hi>Rezin</hi> being ſlain, ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9. but ſhall become a Province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> And obſervable the difference is which the Prophet makes between the deſtruction of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (to wit, in this, that becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the ten Tribes continued a Kingdom, even after <hi>Tiglathpileſer</hi> had made great havock amongſt them, which <hi>Damaſcus</hi> did not; (ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9.) Therefore he doth not ſay, That the Kingdom ſhould ceaſe from <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as he doth of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> but only that <hi>Ephraim's</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes ſhould be beaten down and deſtroyed. And then it follows, <hi>They ſhall be as the glory of the children of Iſrael;</hi> that is, the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſhall be in the ſame glorious condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion with the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which is ſpoken <hi>Ironically,</hi> and the meaning is, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſhould be ſtripped of all wherein they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gloried, their multitude, ſtrength and riches, even as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were. The glory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came at laſt to this, that they were utterly ruined, and carried away captives; and ſo ſhall it be with <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And in that day it ſhall come to paſs, that the glory of Jacob ſhall be made thin,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added by way of explaining that which the Prophet had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſhould be <hi>as the glory of the children of Iſrael;</hi> to wit, that as the glory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly impaired, ſo ſhould it be with the <hi>Syrians</hi> too, and that much about the ſame time. See the Note alſo Chap. 16.14. <hi>And the fatneſs of his fleſh ſhall wax lean.</hi> See the Note, Chap. 10.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. <hi>Job</hi> 15.27. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And it ſhall be as when the harveſt-man gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When the Judgment before threatned ſhall be executed on the <hi>Iſraelites, it ſhall be</hi> that as the harveſt-man doth eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut down the corn, though it grow never ſo thick, and binds and carries it away by whole arm-fulls, ſo ſhall the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with eaſe, partly mow down with the Sword, and partly carry away into Captivity, even the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a manner, though there be never ſo great multitudes of them; ſo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42788:102"/>
that the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be left as a corn-field that is newly reaped, a very few, a little gleaning of them being only left; and this was done, partly by <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> 2 Kin. 15.29. but more fully by <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> 2 Kin. 17.6. <hi>And it ſhall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim;</hi> that is, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe few that are left ſhall alſo be carried away, even as the ſcattered ears that are left in a corn-field are with all diligence gathered up and carried away by poor people: And this was done by <hi>Ezarhaddon,</hi> Ezra 4.2. As for <hi>the valley of Rephaim,</hi> a valley on the North-ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> rendred <hi>the valley of Giants,</hi> Joſh. 15.8. is expreſſed by name only becauſe it was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly known for its great fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Yet gleaning grapes ſhall be left in it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> ſhall thus again and again carry away the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> captive out of their Land, as is before-ſaid, yet ſhall they not make ſuch a clear riddance of them, but that there ſhall be a <hi>gleaning</hi> there, ſome few that ſhall be ſtill left in the Land. See the Note, Chap. 6.13. <hi>As the ſhaking of an Olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermoſt bough, four or five in the outmoſt fruitful branches thereof, ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> which laſt words are added, not only to aſſure them, that what the Prophet had now foretold ſhould certainly come to paſs; but alſo to imply, that becauſe God's Covenant was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> as well as with <hi>Judah,</hi> that he would for ever be their God, therefore even of them alſo there ſhould be a remnant left.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>At that day ſhall a man look to his Maker,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, In that day of their calamity, ſeveral of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> owning and repenting of their former Idolatry, ſhall return to the true God, the Lord their Creator, who had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them to be a holy people to himſelf: See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. And ſhall ſeek to him for help, reſting upon him, as their only ſure refuge: which is repeated again in other words, <hi>And his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the holy One of Iſrael,</hi> ſee the Note, Chap. 1.4, And this was accompliſhed, partly in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when <hi>divers of Aſher, and Manaſſeh, and Zebulun,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thereto by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to keep the Paſſover, and helped to deſtroy all the Altars, and Groves, and Images that were left, not only in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.11, 14. and 31.1. and partly afterward in the days of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.33.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he ſhall not look to the Altars, the work of his hands,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, which he made of his own hand without any warrant or command from God, and that for the worſhip of his Idol-gods; and therefore is that which follows added, <hi>Neither ſhall reſpect that which his fingers have made, either the groves or the Images,</hi> See the Note, Chap. 2.8. For <hi>the groves</hi> here joyned with their <hi>Images,</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.21. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.6. The word in the Original, which is tranſlated in our Bibles, <hi>Images,</hi> may be rendred as it is in the Margin, <hi>Sun-images;</hi> whereby it is like are meant, either images that ſtood abroad open in the air, where the Sun might ſhine upon them; or rather ſuch images, wherein they worſhipped the Sun, and which haply were made round, to repreſent the Orb of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>In that day,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] That is, In that day of <hi>Iſraels</hi> great calamity, mentioned before ver. 4, and 5, (for the three verſes immediatly fore-going
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42788:102"/>
are by our Tranſlators included in a Parentheſis) <hi>ſhall his ſtrong Cities be as a forſaken bough;</hi> that is, as the ſmall twigs and branches growing out of a tree, which the Husband-man paſſeth by and leaves, when he lops the tree, not vouchſafing to cut them off: <hi>And an uppermoſt branch;</hi> that is, a bough left ſtanding on the top of a tree, when all the reſt are lopped away, and ſo the tree is left naked and bare. The meaning is, that <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſtrong Cities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had ſo greatly truſted, ſhould be left in a poor deſpiſed condition, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and forſaken of the greateſt part of their inhabitants, ſtanding alone and deſolate, all the ſmaller Towns and Villages round about them being utterly waſted and deſtroyed. I know that ſome Expoſitors by <hi>a forſaken bough</hi> do underſtand a bough ſtripped of all her beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruit and leaves, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hold that hereby is ſignified, that their ſtrong Cities ſhould be leſt ruined, ſtripped of all their Riches, Glory and Inhabitants, all being fled, ſlain, or carried into Captivity. But the former Expoſition is far the beſt: And ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably hereunto I underſtand the following words, <hi>which they left becauſe of the children of Iſrael,</hi> that is, which ſtrong Cities, thus ruined, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> left for the little remnant of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to dwell in, that were not deſtroyed; God in his Providence ſo diſpoſing it, that there ſhould be ſome poor refuge left for the ſmall remnant of his people, which he determined ſhould eſcape, and not be cut off. This indeed is alſo, I know, otherwiſe expounded by divers Learned men, namely thus, <hi>which they left becauſe of the children of Iſrael;</hi> that is, which ſtrong Cities the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did formerly leave and forſake for fear of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or being diſpoſſeſſed thereof by the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> who would have the meaning of the place to be this, That the ſtrong Cities of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be left <hi>as a forſaken bough,</hi> in that they ſhould be no more able to defend the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> than in former times they were able to defend the <hi>Canaanites</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> but as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did forſake thoſe Cities, though fenced with ſtrong and high walls, for fear of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo now the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould forſake them for fear of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> As for the laſt words, <hi>And there ſhall be deſolation;</hi> either it is meant of the Cities before-mentioned, that even in thoſe that were left, there ſhould be great deſolation; or elſe of the Country in general, that not only in the Cities, but even in the whole Land ther ſhould be extreme deſolation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt forgotten the God of thy ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Becauſe thou haſt ſlighted and deſpiſed the God that hath ſo often ſaved and delivered thee from thine enemies, and ſo would ſtill have done, hadſt thou not forſaken him, and gone after ſtrange gods, <hi>and haſt not been mindful of the rock of thy ſtrength,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. a ſurer refuge than their ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Cities could have been: <hi>Therefore ſhalt thou plant pleaſant plants,</hi> that is, with much care and pains thou ſhalt husband thy grounds, planting it with the choiceſt plants thou canſt get; <hi>And ſhalt ſet it with ſtrange ſlips,</hi> that is, ſlips brought from far out of foreign Countries, which thou ſhalt tend and nurſe with greateſt care, as eſteeming them highly for the rarity and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of them. But all this ſhalt thou do in vain, as is expreſſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>In the day thou ſhalt make thy plant to grow, and in the morning ſhalt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42788:103"/>
thou make thy ſeed to flouriſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Day by day, yea early every morning, thou ſhalt uſe all poſſible means to cauſe thy plants, and the ſeeds thou haſt ſown, to grow up; and accordingly they ſhall ſucceſsfully ſpring up and flouriſh, and give thee great hope of a plentiful crop: <hi>But the harveſt ſhall be a heap in the day of grief and deſperate ſorrow;</hi> that is, in the day when your Country ſhall be deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> they ſhall ſpoil and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all your encreaſe, and ſo your great hopes ſhall come to nothing. That which this expreſſion of their <hi>harveſt</hi> being made a <hi>heap,</hi> ſeems to aim at, is, either that it ſhould be laid in heaps for the enemy to divide and ſhare amongſt them; or elſe, that it ſhould be ſuddenly conſumed, even as a little heap of corn would be, if a mighty Army of hungry Soldiers ſhould come to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Indeed this clauſe may be read, as it is in the Margin, <hi>But the harveſt ſhall be removed in the day of inheritance, and there ſhall be deadly ſorrow;</hi> that is, In the day when thou ſhouldeſt come to inherit, and poſſeſs that which thou haſt long hoped and waited for, all ſhall be ſnatched up and carried away by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and ſo, though in the time of thy planting and ſowing, all went forward joyfully, yet when harveſt comes thou ſhalt reap nothing of thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but extreme grief and ſorrows. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.33. This I conceive is the meaning of this place. Only we muſt conſider, that under this particular of the enemies robbing and ſpoiling the fruit of their ground, their plundering and carrying away all the wealth, which with much labour they had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, is alſo comprehended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Wo to the multitude of many people,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the multitude of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> that under the command of <hi>Pekah</hi> and <hi>Rezin</hi> invaded the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> Chap. 7.1. And others again underſtand it of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and others with them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the ten Tribes. For, ſay they, having in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this Chapter ſpoken of the deſtruction of the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> (ſee the Note above, ver. 1.) here he foretels, how even theſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould likewiſe afterward be deſtroyed: And that this wo is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Prophet againſt them, even out of pity to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> upon whom theſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould exerciſe ſo great cruelty. But now becauſe of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, ver. 13, 14. in the deſcription of the deſtruction of theſe <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the moſt Expoſitors underſtand this of that numerous Army, made up of many ſeveral Nations, that brake into the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> under <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> and this is added to comfort them againſt that havoch that ſhould be made by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> amongſt the Ten Tribes. For leſt they ſhould think, when they have vanquiſhed the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (as is before related) what if they ſhould break into our Country too? To this the Prophet anſwers, that though indeed they ſhould ſo do, yet God would then deſtroy them. <hi>Wo to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of many people, which make a noiſe like the noiſe of the Seas; and to the ruſhing of Nations, that make a ruſhing like the ruſhing of mighty</hi> (or, many) <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> where the breaking in of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with a mighty and confuſed no ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Nations ſhall ruſh like the ruſhing of many waters,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note. <hi>But God ſhall rebuke them.</hi> In great fury and indignation God ſhall deſtroy them. See the Notes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.1. and 2.5. and 119.21. Even as he rebukes the raging of the roaring Seas, ſo ſhall he ſtill their fury, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.7.

See the Note, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.35. <hi>And they ſhall flee far off;</hi> to wit, <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and ſome few with him, that eſcaped and fled back into their own Country; <hi>and ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the mountains before the wind,</hi> which is far more eaſily and ſuddenly blown away, than the chaff or duſt that is in the Valleys, becauſe there the wind hath moſt power. And See alſo the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 21.18. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.5. <hi>And like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.</hi> That is, like a round wiſp of ſtubble, or ſome other light thing, firſt gathered together in a bundle, and then carried away with a Whirlwind.

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And behold, at evening-tide trouble, and before the morning he is not,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be underſtood of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that in the night (which is ſomtimes called, <hi>the Evening,</hi> ſee the Notes <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5.) were terribly affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and put into a confuſed tumult, by the ſudden and unexpected ſlaughter which an Angel made amongſt them, and before morning were all ſlain or fled. See the Notes, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.35, 36. And perhaps too <hi>the evening-tide</hi> is mentioned, becauſe then the Angel began to ſlay them. But I conceive it is rather ſpoken of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to wit, that they ſhould be over night in great terror and trouble, becauſe of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s mighty Army that had beſieged the City, and becauſe of ſome late blaſphemies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> and yet before morning he and all his numerous Army are all dead or gone away, there's not an enemy to be ſeen. The Prophet ſeems to imply, that the fury of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> of which he had ſpoken in the foregoing verſe, ſhould be but like a Tempeſt, that ariſeth in the Evening, and is gone in the Morning; as they ſhould on a ſudden invade the Land of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> ſo on a ſudden they ſhould be deſtroyed. <hi>This is the portion of them that ſpoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.]</hi> That is, The like to this ſhall befal all that make a prey of God's people, and that by the decree and appointment of God, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 2.8. <hi>Whereunto alſo they were appointed.</hi> See alſo the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 20.19.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO to the Land ſhadowing with wings, which is beyond the Rivers of Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.]</hi> This Chapter is throughout very obſcure: and the difficulty of it is chiefly from hence, that it is very queſtionable, what Nation it is againſt whom the wo here mentioned is denounced. Several reaſons are given by Expoſitors, why <hi>the land</hi> here threatned is called a land <hi>ſhadowing with wings;</hi> As 1. Becauſe it was ſhadowed with huge high Mountains, that were ſpread out like wings in the utmoſt coaſts of the Country. Or 2. Becauſe it abounded with ſwarms of flies, and bees, and locuſts, and huge flights of fowl, that out of colder Countries flew thither in great flocks, by reaſon whereof the air was often darkned. Or 3. Becauſe they uſed to cover over the lands, whither they went, with their huge Armies, winged with troops of horſmen, (ſee the Note, Chap. 8.8.) like ſo many thick clouds of Locuſts; of which indeed we have a notable inſtance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.9. where there is mention of an Army of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> that came againſt <hi>Aſa,</hi> the like whereof for number we read not of, either in the Scripture, or (I think) in any other Hiſtory. Or, 4. Becauſe the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Land were wont to extend their power for the protecting and ſhadowing of their neighbouring Nations, or at leaſt to promiſe that they would with their Auxiliary-forces ſhelter them from their enemies; and ſo cauſed them, the people of God eſpecially, to truſt much in the ſhadow of their protection. And indeed it is uſual in the Scripture to ſpeak of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or protection under this Figurative expreſſion, of a ſhadow or covering, and ſhadowing with wings. See the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1, 4. and <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.12. Or, 5. Becauſe it was a Land that abounded with Ships, that ſhadowed the Sea where they lay, and when they were carried before the Wind or the Seas, ſeemed like ſo many flying Birds, both in regard of the ſwiftneſs of their motion, and becauſe their Sails were thereon like wings, according to that of the Poet,—<hi>Velorum pandimus alas.</hi> But then the great Queſtion is, What that Country was, that is here called <hi>the Land ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with wings?</hi> Very many Expoſitors hold that it is <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is ſo called. And true it is, that moſt of the reaſons before given, why it is called, <hi>The Land ſhadowing with wings,</hi> do very well ſuit with <hi>Egypt,</hi> eſpecially the two laſt, which ſeem the moſt probable. For <hi>Egypt</hi> abounded with ſhips, and traded much in merchandiſing, and the <hi>Jews</hi> truſted much in the aid of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> being ſtill ready to fly to them for ſhelter, and to ſend to them for ſuccour,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42788:104"/>
when they were in danger to be invaded by any other Nation. But yet, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the following Chapter <hi>Egypt</hi> is threatned by it ſelf. And 2. becauſe in the very next words it is ſaid, <hi>which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;</hi> whereas <hi>Egypt</hi> lay nearer to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> than <hi>Ethiopia</hi> did; it is rather thought that <hi>Egypt</hi> is not <hi>the land ſhadowing with wings,</hi> againſt which the wo is here denounced; but rather the land of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or at leaſt that part of it which lay Southward of <hi>Judea,</hi> near to the Red-Sea, together with thoſe other neighbouring Nations that are uſually mentioned together with the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> as we may ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.9. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.5. Which ſeems moſt probable, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was a rich Country, very populous, (and therefore their Armies were uſually exceeding numerous, as is before-noted) full of Havens, Ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and merchandizing, that often joyned with <hi>Egypt</hi> in aiding the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt their enemies, that were in danger to ſwallow up them, together with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and a land that might well, for all the other reaſons before-given, be termed <hi>a land ſhadowing with wings.</hi> And 2. Becauſe having here denounced deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt this <hi>land ſhadowing with wings,</hi> and againſt <hi>Egypt</hi> in the following Chapter, then in the 20th Chap. he ſeems to joyn them both together, and there the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are expreſly named, ver. 4. <hi>So ſhall the King of Aſſyria lead away the Egyptians priſoners, and the Ethiopians captives.</hi> That indeed which makes this moſt queſtionable is, that concerning this <hi>land ſhadowing with wings,</hi> thoſe words are added, <hi>which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.</hi> But conſidering that all Expoſitors in a manner agree, that by <hi>the rivers of Ethiopia,</hi> the ſtreams of <hi>Nilus</hi> are here principally meant, ſo called, becauſe from and thorough the land of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> they run down into <hi>Egypt</hi> (though other rivers that run into <hi>Nilus</hi> may be alſo included.) I ſee not but that the reaſon of adding this clauſe, <hi>which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,</hi> may be to ſhew, that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here denounced ſhould fall even upon the utmoſt parts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that were beyond the ſprings of <hi>Nilus.</hi> So that I conclude, that according to our Tranſlation, wherein the wo is clearly denounced againſt <hi>the land ſhadowing with wings, Ethiopia</hi> muſt needs be meant: And that this wo is here denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> either becauſe the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had been often-times great enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we may ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.3. and 14.9. Or elſe rather to diſcover to the <hi>Jews</hi> their folly in reſting upon the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> for help, that ſhould not be able to ſecure themſelves. The very drift of this Phraſe, <hi>Wo to the land ſhadowing with wings,</hi> being to imply, (according to the Reaſons before given for it) that notwithſtanding her high ſhadowing Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or the multitude of ſhipping, or her huge Armies, or her forwardneſs to be a ſhadow of defence to others, even ſhe her ſelf ſhould be miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And many hold, that this was done by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> when <hi>Tirhakah</hi> the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> went out to fight againſt them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>That ſendeth Ambaſſadors by Sea,</hi> &amp;c.] According to our Tranſlation this is clearly ſpoken of the Land deſcribed in the foregoing Verſe, that is, the people inhabiting that Land, to wit the <hi>Ethiopian, that ſendeth Ambaſſadors by Sea,</hi> that is, by the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſay ſome (it being uſual with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to call all great waters Seas) or by the Red-Sea, which had <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42788:105"/>
the one ſide, and <hi>Arabia</hi> on the other, and was therefore alſo called, <hi>The Gulf of</hi> Arabia; <hi>even in veſſels of bulruſhes upon the waters,</hi> that is, in boats, barks or ſhips made of bulruſhes, but overlaid with pitch, both within and without, to keep out the water; for indeed we find in many ancient Writers, that ſuch kind of Veſſels were much uſed in thoſe times, both in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> not only becauſe by reaſon of their lightneſs they ſailed the more ſwiftly; but alſo becauſe they did not ſink ſo deep into the water, as our Veſſels made of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber uſually do, but did rather float and glide on the top or ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (with reſpect whereto ſome think this expreſſion is uſed of Veſſels of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes <hi>upon the waters</hi>) and ſo were in the leſs danger of being ſplit or broken upon the rocks and ſhelves, of which there were many in the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> Yea, and becauſe where there were great Cataracts, or ſteep downfals of water, they could hale them aſhore, and carry them on their ſhoulders over land, and then put them into the river again beyond thoſe downfals. But whither were theſe Ambaſſadors ſent by the <hi>Ethiopians?</hi> I anſwer, That is ſet forth in the following words, wherein the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are brought in, <hi>Saying, Go ye ſwift meſſengers to a Nation ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c. For the underſtanding whereof we muſt know, That 1. ſome underſtand this of the Embaſſadors or Heralds ſent by the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to denounce war againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> (which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was done when <hi>Tirhakah</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> went out againſt them, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.9.) and that they are called <hi>ſwift meſſengers,</hi> with reſpect to the lightneſs or ſwiftneſs of the veſſels wherein they were ſent. And accordingly, as with reſpect to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> they underſtand the deſcription that is here given us of the Nation to whom they were ſent, <hi>to a Nation ſcattered and peeled;</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>ſcattered,</hi> becauſe their Forces were diſperſed abroad, ſome in <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſome in other Countries; <hi>and peeled,</hi> becauſe the people were by this means left bare of their Soldiery: Or, becauſe they had been peeled and made bald by long continuing Wars, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18. (and if we read this, as it is in the Margin, <hi>outſpread and poliſhed,</hi> the meaning muſt needs be, that they were a Nation that had large Territories, and were glorious for all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bravery) <hi>to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto;</hi> that is, that have been from their firſt original unto this time a terror to other Nations, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their fierceneſs and cruelty, and the many Countries that had been ſubdued by them: <hi>A Nation meted out and trodden down,</hi> that is, that ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be meted out and deſtroyed. See the Notes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.2. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.13. or as it is in the Margin, <hi>A Nation that meteth out and treadeth down,</hi> that is, that meteth out other Nations to deſtroy them, or that trampleth and treadeth them down at their pleaſure: Or, that ſeeketh to bring all the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout into ſubjection to them, to impoſe what yoke, what Laws and conditions they pleaſe upon them, or elſe they tread them under foot: <hi>whoſe land the rivers have ſpoiled;</hi> or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>whoſe Land the Rivers deſpiſe,</hi> that is, whoſe land the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> deſpiſe, as being ſo compaſſed about with great Rivers, that they have no cauſe at all to be afraid of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> Thus, I ſay, ſeveral Expoſitors underſtand this paſſage of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſending out their Meſſengers to denounce War againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in this manner, <hi>A Nation ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c. Purpoſely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that their expedition againſt them would be eaſie and juſt; becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42788:105"/>
a Nation <hi>ſcattered and peeled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and from whom the ſcituation of their own Country, being environed with great Rivers, would ſurely defend them; and juſt, becauſe againſt a Tyrannous People, that were fit to be oppoſed and curbed. And the drift of all this (ſay they) is, to diſcover the folly of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> confidence, who in the truſt of their own ſtrength, and the ſtrength of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> their aſſociates, did thus ſlight the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> by whom not long after they ſhould be utterly ruined. Again, 2ly. Others underſtand this of Embaſſadors ſent by the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of aid and ſupplies from themſelves and from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians, Go ye ſwift Meſſengers,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to a Nation ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and peeled,</hi> that is, to the poor <hi>Jews,</hi> a Nation miſerably afflicted, and exceedingly exhauſted by divers devaſtations that have been made in their Country; <hi>To a people terrible from their beginning hitherto,</hi> that is, to a people, that from their firſt being a people, or their firſt being God's peculiar people, unto that preſent time, had been ever and anon in ſuch a ſad and dreadful condition, by reaſon of the Judgments executed upon them for their ſins, that they were <hi>an aſtoniſhment</hi> to other Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.37. it was enough to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and affright men to behold into what a diſmal plight they were brought: Or rather, to a people that from their firſt beginning unto that time had been terrible to other Nations, in regard of the great and wonderful works God had wrought for them in all ages, and the ſtrange Judgments he had executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Enemies. <hi>A Nation meted out and trodden down;</hi> that is, that hath been often by their Enemies ſubdued and deſtroyed, or that is now by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> deſigned to be utterly waſted and deſtroyed: <hi>Whoſe land the rivers have ſpoiled;</hi> that is, the Nations breaking in upon them like an overflowing Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that carrieth all before it: See the Note, Chap. 8.7. And now they that thus underſtand this place of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſending Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Jews,</hi> with a promiſe that they would come in to their aid againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> do accordingly conceive, that by inſerting this, the Prophet's drift is covertly to tax the folly of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in reſting ſo much upon theſe vaunting promiſes of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> that were themſelves to be deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as well as they. But 3ly. Others hold, that the Meſſengers here mentioned, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſent by the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or by the Eaſtern <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Arabia,</hi> a part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> (where the Seat of that great Kingdom was) to the Weſtern <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> that inhabited a part of <hi>Africa,</hi> on the South of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and were divided from the Eaſtern <hi>Ethiopians</hi> by the Red-ſea, or the Gulf of <hi>Arabia;</hi> and that theſe Meſſengers were ſent, either to ſtir them up (which ſome think) to invade and vex the <hi>Jews:</hi> or elſe rather to inform them of the great preparations made by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> againſt thoſe parts, and to perſwade them to levy Forces, that they might aid the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſo withal ſecure their own Countries againſt ſuch a potent prevailing Enemy, that having ſubdued <hi>Judea,</hi> would be likely enough preſently to over-run their Countries too. And accordingly they underſtand the deſcription here given us by the Prophet, of the Nation to whom they were ſent, <hi>Go ye ſwift Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to a Nation ſcattered and peeled;</hi> that is, to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or rather to the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who are called <hi>a ſcattered</hi> Nation, or (as it is the Margin) <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread,</hi> becauſe of their large Territories, or the great extent of Land, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42788:106"/>
was overſpread by them; and <hi>peeled,</hi> or <hi>poliſhed,</hi> becauſe they were a beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſmooth-skin'd people; or becauſe they were to be peeled and plundered of all they had by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> or, <hi>ſcattered and peeled,</hi> becauſe they were an abject, baſe Nation, commonly ſold up and down for Slaves, as indeed the <hi>Moors</hi> uſe to be: <hi>To a people terrible from their beginning hitherto,</hi> that is, that from the firſt had been a grim, fierce and ſavage people, and ſo ſtill were: <hi>A Nation meted out and trodden down,</hi> or, <hi>that meteth out and treadeth down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, a Nation that is deſigned of God to be deſtroyed, or that uſeth to ſubdue and level all before them, where they came: <hi>Whoſe land the rivers have ſpoiled,</hi> to wit, the great Rivers of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> by their mighty Inundations; or rather, <hi>whoſe land the rivers deſpiſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who making account to break in upon <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> like ſome mighty overflowing rivers, as they have been wont to do upon other Countries, as is before noted; do deſpiſe and ſlight the ſtrength of the Land, not doubting but that they ſhall eaſily over-run and ſubdue it. And indeed this laſt Expoſition of this verſe, I judge the moſt probable, to wit, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are the Nation here deſcribed, they being the people againſt whom the Prophet here denounceth a Wo; and that either by way of comforting the <hi>Jews,</hi> by foretelling the utter deſtruction of theſe their enemies; or rather by way of hinting the folly of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with ſo much confidence upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> that were ſhortly to be deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as well as themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, ſee ye when he lifteth up an enſign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.]</hi> Very many learned Expoſitors do underſtand this of God's overthrowing the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> The Prophet, ſay they, having in the foregoing verſes foretold the woful deſtruction that ſhould come upon the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> thereby covertly taxing the folly of his people in relying upon them, and their Aſſociates, for help, that ſhould not be able to defend themſelves from the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> here he adds, for the comfort of his people, that though they ſhould be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the help which they vainly expected from <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet the Lord ſhould ſo wonderfully deliver them, and deſtroy their Enemies, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that all the Nations far and near ſhould ſee and acknowledg, that it was God that had fought againſt them in the defence of his people, whom they ſought to deſtroy. But I rather conceive with others, that the Prophet doth here ſtill proceed, in ſetting forth the woful deſtruction that ſhould come upon <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and her Aſſociates, and that by calling upon <hi>all the inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,</hi> to <hi>ſee when he lifteth up an enſign upon the mountains, and to hear when he bloweth a trumpet;</hi> he implies, Either 1. That ſeveral of all Nations, far and near, ſhould come in to ſerve in the War, which was made by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans</hi> againſt <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> as readily, as if the Lord had by the ſound of Trumpets, or the lifting up of an Enſign upon the mountains, ſummoned them to come in; See the Notes, chap. 5.26. and 13.2. Or 2. That all the Nations round about ſhould ſee the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning triumphantly and in great jollity, with Colours flying and ſound of Trumpets, from the conqueſt of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> which tends to aſſure God's people of the certainty of this, which in regard of the ſtrength of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> might
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42788:106"/>
ſeem to them impoſſible. Or, 3. That the judgment of God upon the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> ſhould be ſo ſtrange and wonderful, that all the world in a manner ſhould ring of it; yea, and all Nations ſhould take notice of it, and be as fully ſatisfied, that it was God that had brought this ruin upon them, as if they had ſeen the Lord lifting up an Enſign on the Mountains, and blowing a Trumpet, by way of gathering his Armies, and leading them on againſt that people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For ſo the Lord ſaid unto me, I will take my reſt,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will ſit quietly in my houſe, and not interpoſe my ſelf to hinder or croſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of my peoples enemies. The Lord ſpeaks here of himſelf after the manner of man, <hi>I will take my reſt, and I will conſider in my dwelling-place,</hi> that is, in my Temple, the place which I have choſen for my ſetled habitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Or rather in Heaven, <hi>my ſet dwelling,</hi> as it is here called in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> I will ſit quietly, and only from thence behold and conſider what is done upon earth. Divers of our beſt Expoſitors hold, that the drift of this verſe is merely to aſſure the <hi>Jews,</hi> That in the midſt of the confuſions that ſhould be amongſt them, and the Heathen Nations round about them, God would take care to bleſs, and chear up and proſper them. The Prophet, ſay they, having threatned deſtruction to the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and their Aſſociates in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes, (to which he returns again in the verſe after this) in this verſe he interpoſeth a promiſe concerning the care that he would take of his people, in the midſt of theſe confuſions. <hi>I will take my reſt, and I will conſider in my dwelling place;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I will indeed for a time ſit ſtill and take my reſt in my dwelling-place, as if I minded not what the Enemy intended and did againſt my people; I will ſuffer the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to go on in ſubduing many Nations, and to invade and waſte <hi>Judea,</hi> yea to go up to the beſieging of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> and when the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and their Aſſociates ſhall raiſe up Forces to withſtand the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and to aid <hi>Judea,</hi> I will ſuffer the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to vanquiſh and deſtroy theſe Auxiliary Forces, that were coming in to the aid of my people, and will only look on as a Spectator of that bloody Tragedy: But in the mean ſeaſon I will in my dwelling-place conſider of what I ſee done; when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> after this conqueſt of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> come flying upon the Jews, I will take notice of their doings and their rage, (as it is ſaid, 2 Kin. 19.27. <hi>I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage againſt me</hi>) and I will conſider of the danger of my people and my dwelling-place in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and what is fit to be done, that ſo though I do not preſently exert my power in driving away the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> yet I may ſeaſonably ſecure my people and my dwelling-place, and not ſuffer my ſelf to be diſpoſſeſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the <hi>Aſſyrian.</hi> And then to ſhew what ſhould be the effect of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident care over his people<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, even when he ſeemed to ſit ſtill and nor to mind them, he adds thoſe laſt words, <hi>I will conſider in my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs,</hi> (or, <hi>after-rain) and like a Cloud of dew in the heat of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;</hi> That is, as the heat of the Sun ſhining upon herbs in a clear day, or after rain doth refreſh the herbs, and cauſe them to ſpring up and flouriſh very ſweetly; and as a ſhadowy cloud, that doth not pour down hurtful ſhowers of rain, but only diſtil a cooling dew, doth comfortably allay the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42788:107"/>
extremity of Harveſt-heat, and ſo doth refreſh not the Husbandman only, but the Corn alſo, and make it the more flowry; ſo the Lord's provident care over his people will at laſt manifeſt it ſelf by ſhining comfortably on them, when ariſing from his reſt, he ſhall deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſo by a timely deliverance ſhall revive and refreſh them, after all their fears and dangers by reaſon of the heat of their Enemies Invaſion. And ſome think too, that there may be an Alluſion in the words, to that Pillar of a Cloud and Fire, that went before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs; for which ſee the Note, Chap. 4.5. Thus, I ſay, divers learned Expoſitors underſtand this verſe, as inſerted merely for the comfort of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by ſetting forth the care that God would take of them, even whilſt he ſeemed not to mind them; but to ſuffer the enemy to go on as they pleaſed. And therefore alſo ſome do read the foregoing words, as it is in the Margin; not, <hi>I will conſider in my dwelling-place;</hi> but, <hi>I will regard my ſet dwelling;</hi> that is, I will however take care for <hi>Zion.</hi> But becauſe the Prophet ſeems clearly to intend the ſame thing in this and the two following verſes, I conceive it is better underſtood by others; Either 1. Of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and their Confederates, that whilſt they muſtered great Forces, and went out with great Pride and Confidence againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> God would ſit ſtill, and ſeem to ſhine favourably from his dwelling-place upon them, <hi>Like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,</hi> till thereby they became ripe for that deſtruction, when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> overthrew them, and made ſuch a dreadful ſlaughter amongſt them. Or elſe, 2. Of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that when they invaded the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God would not preſently oppoſe them, but would rather be unto them <hi>like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harveſt,</hi> which are the ordinary means whereby the Corn and other Fruits of the earth are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and that cauſe them to proſper and flouriſh, and haſten the ripening of them: And ſo the meaning is, That God would ſuffer them to go on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly and ſucceſsfully (as they did in their vanquiſhing the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> that were coming in to the aid of <hi>Judea</hi>) and with a great deal of triumphant joy to proceed in their intended deſign for the ſubduing of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet after all this would ſuddenly cut them off. I know that divers Expoſitors do underſtand this laſt clauſe, <hi>I will conſider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harveſt,</hi> of Gods deſtroying the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> to wit, that God would be unto them as a torrid heat, that ſcorcheth and parcheth herbs; or as thoſe Dews, that in Harveſt-time do rot and blaſt the corn. But I ſee no probable ground for this Expoſition. The drift of the words is rather to ſhew, that even when God ſeems to ſit ſtill in his dwelling-place, as if he minded not the Government of the world, nor what became of his people; yea whilſt he ſeems to ſhine favourably upon his and his peoples enemies, yet even then by the ſecret working of his Providence, he makes way to their ruin, and doth only ripen them for deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For afore the harveſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Under <hi>Harveſt</hi> the Vintage is here alſo comprehended, as before, Chap. 17.11. becauſe they uſually are together: <hi>when the bud is perfect,</hi> that is, when the bud, that firſt appears, is become a perfect, but a green grape; <hi>and the ſowre grape is ripening in the flowre,</hi> that is,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42788:107"/>
when the grapes, that are grown out of the flower, and are yet ſowr, begin to ripen; to wit, when the Harveſt or Vintage is nigh at hand; <hi>He ſhall cut off the ſprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches;</hi> that is, he ſhall cut down both the ſmaller twigs, and the greater boughs or branches, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the green grapes growing thereon. Now ſome underſtand this of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> to wit, that when he had vanquiſhed the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhould begin to think, that his deſign for the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen apace, as making full account that it was in a manner his own, and that he ſhould reap a rich harveſt of all his labours, on a ſudden the Lord ſhould mow down his mighty Army, both Captains and common Soldiers, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.35. and ſo all his endeavours ſhould be fruſtrate before they came to maturity. But rather this is ſpoken of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> whoſe deſtruction is ſet forth all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in this Chapter, and that as an effect of that which the Prophet had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, concerning the Lords taking his reſt in his dwelling-place, and ſuffering the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to proſper, yea his ſeeming to ſhine favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably upon them; namely, that when they had raiſed a great Army to beat off the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and were gone forth with great aſſurance of breaking them in pieces, before they had effected what they intended, they ſhould be cut down and deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> great and ſmall, fathers and children, even as when the ſprigs and greater branches of a Vine are lopped in the prime of her pride, when ſhe was full of grapes, but green and not fit to be eaten. The ſame thing therefore that was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, is here aſſerted again under other Figurative expreſſions, to wit, That God doth not always cut off his enemies preſently, but ſuffers them to flouriſh for a time; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when their hopes are greateſt of bringing their Deſigns to perfection, he ſuddenly heweth down both them and their Poſterity. But indeed ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this here of the deſtruction that was brought upon the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>They ſhall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beaſts of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thoſe Vine-ſprigs and branches mentioned in the foregoing verſe, with the branches of unripe grapes thereon, being cut down and caſt away, ſhall be left lying on heaps together, for the fowls that uſually breed and abide on the Mountains, to feed on, and for the beaſts of the field to browſe on: <hi>And the fowls ſhall ſummer upon them, and all the beaſts of the earth ſhall winter upon them,</hi> that is, both the fowls and beaſts ſhall abide on them, as finding harbour and food there, all the year long, both Summer and Winter. Now this ſome underſtand of the wealth of the land, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein ſtill abiding, being left as a prey to their Conquerors and new Lords, or to Thieves and Robbers, as it uſually falls out in Countries that have been lately ſubdued and waſted by the invaſion of enemies. But according to the Expoſition of the foregoing verſe, it is better underſtood of the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſay ſome, ſlain by the Angel, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. but rather of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſlain by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> (and indeed ſome extend it to both <hi>together</hi>) to wit, that they ſhould be meat for Eagles, and Vulturs, and ſuch like fowls of prey, here called Fowls of the mountains, and for the beaſts of the earth, and that for a whole year together, by reaſon of the multitudes of thoſe that ſhall
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42788:108"/>
be ſlain, and that there ſhall be none left to bury them, which is implied in thoſe laſt words, <hi>And the fowls ſhall ſummer upon them, and all the beaſts of the earth ſhall winter upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>In that time ſhall the preſent be brought unto the Lord of hoſts, of a people ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c.] According to the Expoſition before given of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe, to which the Prophet doth here clearly allude, we muſt certainly underſtand this alſo: 1. They that hold, that it is the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that are there called, <hi>A Nation ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c. do accordingly underſtand theſe words thus, That at that time when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed by the Angel of the Lord, (as they conceived is foretold in the foregoing verſes) from the ſpoil of that their ruined Army, who ſhould then indeed be <hi>a people ſcattered and peeled,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould bring Preſents to the Lord at <hi>Zion.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. Again, 2. They that ſay, that by <hi>a Nation ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c. is meant the Jews, do likewiſe underſtand this place of them, to wit, thus; Either, 1. That they that were looked upon with pity and contempt, as <hi>a people ſcattered and peeled,</hi> when they ſhould ſee, that though the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> on whoſe help they had vainly relied, yet the Lord had miraculouſly delivered them from their proud enemies, ſhould thereupon go with a Preſent of Praiſe and Thanksgiving, Sacrifices, and other Gifts and Offerings, unto the dwelling-place of God in <hi>Zion.</hi> Or elſe, 2. That after that time, when the Lord had deſtroyed the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> a remnant of God's people, then indeed <hi>a ſcattered and peeled people,</hi> ſhould by <hi>Cyrus</hi> be ſent home out of <hi>Babylon</hi> with many rich Gifts, and ſo ſhould <hi>be brought</hi> as <hi>a Preſent to the Lord</hi> at <hi>Mount Zion.</hi> But 3. Becauſe the whole Argument of this Chapter is concerning the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> therefore it ſeems more probable, that as before, verſe 2. ſo here alſo they are <hi>The people ſcattered and peeled,</hi> &amp;c. of whom the Prophet here ſpeaks, foretelling, that after all theſe ruins and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities from this people, or of this people, there ſhould be <hi>a preſent brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord of Hoſts at Zion;</hi> The meaning whereof is, either that many of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſhould by the <hi>Jews,</hi> that lived amongſt them, be brought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Faith and Religion, (even before the coming of Chriſt into the world) and ſo ſhould bring Gifts to the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and worſhip the true God there, as the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch did, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27. Or elſe, that in the days of the Goſpel they ſhould embrace the Chriſtian Faith, and ſo ſhould be brought in as a preſent to God, joyning themſelves to the Church of Chriſt, whereof <hi>Zion</hi> was a Type; the firſt fruits whereof we find accompliſhed in the converſion of that noble <hi>Ethiopian</hi> before-mentioned. And thus this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſeems to be the ſame with that, Zeph. 3.10. <hi>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my Suppliants, even the daughter of my diſperſed ſhall bring mine offering.</hi> See alſo the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.31. and 72.10.</p>

Becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> joyned with the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> by way of aiding the <hi>Jews,</hi> therefore the Prophet, having in the foregoing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter foretold the ruin of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> here he alſo prophecieth againſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> their Aſſociates; and that ſtill to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> their folly, in relying ſo much upon theſe Nations. <hi>Behold,</hi> (he ſpeaketh as of a thing that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to come to paſs; and he ſpeaks of God, as of a King that with his Troops of Horſe breaks in upon an enemies Country) <hi>the Lord rideth upon a ſwift cloud, and ſhall come into Egypt.</hi> As for this expreſſion of his riding <hi>upon a ſwift cloud,</hi> (for which ſee alſo the Notes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.3. and 104.3.) It is to imply, that he ſhould break in upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> like a violent Storm, ſuddenly, ſpeedily, and irreſiſtibly: For how could their walls and bulwarks keep out him, that from the clouds would break in upon them? Nor is it improbable, which ſome think, that this expreſſion of a ſtormy Cloud, is the rather uſed alſo, becauſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>they have no rain,</hi> Zach. 14.18.

twelve Kingdoms; and then afterwards upon new diſſentions, <hi>Pſammitichus,</hi> one of their new Kings, being caſt out by the reſt, by the help of his Friends, and the aid of foreign Forces which he called in, he vanquiſhed his enemies, and brought all <hi>Egypt</hi> under his ſole dominion: For this, they ſay, was about the end of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, or the beginning of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s reign.

And hereto agrees that which followeth, <hi>And I will deſtroy the counſel thereof;</hi> that is, I will bereave them of all ability to adviſe what ſhould be done for the ſecuring of themſelves, or their State; they ſhall be in their aſtoniſhment like ſo many fools or mad-men, not knowing which way to turn themſelves. See the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 5.17, 20, 24. Or, All their conſultations ſhall come to nothing. And indeed the more obſervable that is which is here threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in thoſe times were highly conceited of themſelves for their great Learning and Wiſdom, and were indeed for theſe things migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily admired throughout the world. That which is tranſlated in our Bibles, <hi>And the ſpirit of Egypt ſhall fail in the midſt thereof,</hi> is in the Hebrew, <hi>And the ſpirit of Egypt ſhall be emptied in the midſt thereof;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, All their Wit and Underſtanding ſhall be drained out. And herein there may be an Alluſion to their folly in draining away the waters of the river <hi>Nilus;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome think the Prophet ſpeaks afterward, ver. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſhall ſeek to the Idols,</hi> &amp;c] To wit, by praying to them: See the Note before, Chap. 15.2. Or, by asking counſel at the Oracles they had there; according to that which followeth, <hi>And to the Charmers, and to them that have Familiar Spirits, and to the Wizzards;</hi> For which ſee the Note, Chap. 8.19. And this is added as a clear evidence, how void of wiſdom and counſel they ſhould be, in that not knowing what to do, they ſhould thus run from one vain means to another, as men that were indeed at their wits end.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the Hebrew, <hi>Lords;</hi> which therefore many underſtand of thoſe twelve Lords, that after the death of <hi>Sethon</hi> divided the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> into twelve petty Kingdoms, and did each of them in their ſeveral Dominions by cauſeleſs huge Taxes, and their civil Broils amongſt themſelves, mightily oppreſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And accordingly the next clauſe <hi>And a fierce King ſhall rule over them,</hi> they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42788:109"/>
underſtand of <hi>Pſammitichus,</hi> who at laſt ſubdued them all, and tyrannized cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elly over the whole Land; of which ſee the Note before, ver. 2. But now ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny again underſtand both the one and the other, of foreign Kings, that often vanquiſhed the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and made ſlaves of them, and ſometimes ſubdued the Land. Thus ſome think the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to be <hi>the cruel Lord, and the fierce King</hi> here intended, according to that which is ſaid in the following Chapter, ver. 4. <hi>So ſhall the King of Aſſyria lead away the Egyptians priſoners;</hi> and others think it is meant of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who, amongſt other Nations, did at laſt ſubdue and cruelly waſte the whole Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> according to that which we find often foretold by the Prophets, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.26. where God ſaith of the <hi>Egyptians, I will deliver them into the hand of thoſe that ſeek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar,</hi> &amp;c. And Ezek. 29.19. <hi>Behold, I will give the Land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar, King of Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed we may the rather think, that this is here intended, becauſe the expreſſion here uſed in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſeems to imply a total and perfect ſubduing of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was effected by <hi>Nebuchadrezzar. And the Egyptians will I ſhut up into the hand of a cruel Lord;</hi> That is, I will give them up ſo abſolutley into his power, that he ſhall mightily oppreſs them, and they ſhall be no way able to ſhake off his yoke, or to reſcue themſelves out of their bondage. Yea ſome hold, that all the ſeveral evils before-mentioned, that came upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> may be here included. For, ſay they, the drift of this Prophecy being to ſhew the Folly of the <hi>Jews</hi> in relying ſo much upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> (which they did even to the reign of the Sons of <hi>Joſiah</hi>) the Prophet doth accordingly foretel, what a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſad times were coming upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein they ſhould not be able to ſecure themſelves, and much leſs to help the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the waters ſhall fail from the Sea,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the Sea</hi> here ſome underſtand the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call all great waters, Seas) and ſo they make it the ſame with that which followeth; <hi>And the river,</hi> (that is <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſee the Note, Chap. 11.15.) <hi>ſhall be waſted and dried up.</hi> But others again underſtand it, as the words do plainly ſeem to import, the firſt clauſe of the ſinking or failing of the waters of the Sea, and the ſecond of the drying up of the waters of <hi>Nilus.</hi> But what was the failing of the waters of the Sea and <hi>Nilus,</hi> that is here threatned? I anſwer, 1. It may be underſtood to be only Figuratively and Hyperbolically ſpoken. Becauſe, ſay ſome, the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> thought the Sea and <hi>Nilus</hi> ſuch a ſure defence unto their Country, that there was no fear of their being invaded by foreign Enemies: therefore by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion here uſed, the Prophet would imply, that theſe ſhould be no defence to them, but that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (or <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) ſhould break in upon them, as eaſily as if the waters of the Sea, and the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> were dried up. Or, ſay others, becauſe the wealth and plenty of <hi>Egypt</hi> did much depend upon their Traffique by Sea, and upon the overflowings of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which inſtead of rain, watered their grounds; and by ſuch ſlimy ſtuff, as it brought down with it, made the Soyl exceeding fruitful: Therefore by this expreſſion the Prophet intimates, that partly by their Civil Wars, and partly by the invaſion of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be brought into as poor, and forlorn, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a condition, as if <hi>the wate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:42788:110"/>
ſhould <hi>be waſted and dried up;</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.24. But 2. it may be underſtood Literally; as namely, either 1. of a great drought that God ſhould bring upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereby, and that eſpecially by the low ebb that ſhould be in the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> there ſhould be a ſore Dearth and Famine all over the land. Or, 2. of that great check that was given to the overflowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the manifold detriment which thereby redounded to the whole land, when thoſe twelve Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe, drained the river in ſeveral places, and by ſeveral channels, for the more conveniency of their building thoſe two huge Pyramids, and a Labyrinth not far from them, (which were in after-times for their bigneſs and workmanſhip the wonder of the world) and ſome ſay too for the making of that vaſt Lake, called the Lake of <hi>Moeris,</hi> or <hi>Meroe;</hi> all which they did merely to ſatisfie their own Luſt and Ambition, mightily thereby oppreſſing the people, whom they imployed in theſe ſtupendious works, and impoveriſhing the land in many regards, by weakning the river ſo, that it could not overflow the Country, as it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done. And this indeed ſuits well with the deſcription given us in the following verſes, of the manifold miſchiefs which <hi>Egypt</hi> underwent by the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their waters.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And they ſhall turn the rivers far away,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The ſeven ſtreams of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſee the Note, Chap. 11.15. Or rather, the brooks or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſes drawn from thence. It is ſpoken of thoſe that by draining the river had been the cauſe of the failing of the waters, mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe. And this expreſſion of turning the rivers far away, as if they minded them not, ſeems to imply their ſlighting and diſregarding the common good of the land, in the overflowings of <hi>Nilus: And the brooks of defence ſhall be emptied and dried up;</hi> That is, The brooks or rivers drawn out of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which were a great defence to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or which were purpoſely drawn out for the environing and defending many of their Cities and ſtrong Holds; or the brooks which were defended or kept in with ſtrong banks. The meaning is, that the brooks of <hi>Nilus</hi> ſhould be dried up, where they were wideſt and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and where the river ran with the ſtrongeſt ſtream. <hi>The reeds and flags ſhall wither;</hi> to wit, for want of moiſture. And theſe are the rather mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did many ways make great uſe of them; for of theſe they made darts, mats for their beds, weeles for their fiſhing, baskets, and many ſuch things; yea their boats and barks. See the Note before, Chap. 18.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The Paper-reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>Paper-reeds</hi> here are meant reeds, of whoſe rind or skin they made Paper, which was a great commodity in <hi>Egypt</hi> in thoſe days; and by <hi>the mouth of the brooks</hi> is meant, the bank or brink of the brooks, where theſe canes or reeds uſed to grow. For it ſeems not ſo probable which ſome ſay, that by <hi>the mouth of the brooks</hi> ſhould be meant the Fountain or Spring-head of the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> at which the waters iſſued out as at a mouth (which was not in <hi>Egypt</hi>); or thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where the water of the river did firſt enter and diſgorge it ſelf into thoſe channels and water-courſes that were drawn from thence; and that becauſe the Prophet's aim is to ſhew, that all things ſhould wither all the land over, even in thoſe places which lay cloſe to the banks or brinks of thoſe brooks, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42788:110"/>
were drawn from the river, which uſed to be the moſt fruitful places; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which follows, <hi>And every thing ſown by the brooks ſhall wither, be driven away, and be no more;</hi> whereby is meant, that as thoſe things that grew of themſelves, ſo thoſe things alſo that were ſet or ſown, ſhould wither and utterly periſh, even in the moſt fertile places. Yet ſome, I know, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this of the ſpoil that ſhould be made of thoſe things by the rage of war.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The Fiſhers alſo ſhall mourn,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fed much on fiſh, wherewith that Country abounded, (and the more, by reaſon they did ſuperſtitiouſly forbear the killing and eating of many ſorts of beaſts) whence was that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Numb. 11.5. <hi>We remember the fiſh we did eat in Egypt freely;</hi> and ſo many lived on the trade of fiſhing: Therefore it is ſaid, that they ſhould mourn, to wit, becauſe their Trade would be quite marred, the fiſh dying for want of water: <hi>And all they that caſt angle into the brooks ſhall lament, and they that ſpread nets upon the waters ſhall languiſh;</hi> to wit, as pining away for grief, when they ſhould ſee their way of getting a livelihood quite decayed and brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Moreover, they that work in fine flax, and they that weave net-works</hi> (or, white works) <hi>ſhall be confounded.]</hi> That is, They ſhall be aſhamed and overwhelmed with vexation, to ſee their Trade quite loſt, for want of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to work upon; fine yarn and fine linnen were of the principal commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whence is that of the Harlot, Prov. 7.16. <hi>I have deckt my bed with fine linnen of Egypt;</hi> See alſo the Note, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.28. And therefore the better to ſet forth, how their land ſhould be impoveriſhed by the failing of their waters, this alſo is added, that they ſhould want materials for the making of theſe things, which were their chief traffique in foreign parts. Indeed, becauſe in the foregoing verſe the Prophet had ſpoken of the mourning of their fiſhermen, ſome hold that by <hi>networks</hi> here are meant nets for fiſhing. But becauſe <hi>fine flax</hi> is here forementioned, as the ſtuff whereof theſe <hi>net-works</hi> were made, it is more probably thought, that hereby is meant pure white linnen-cloth, or garments woven or wrought net-wiſe, See the Note, Chap. 3.18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And they ſhall be broken in the purpoſes thereof, all that make ſluces and ponds for fiſh.]</hi> This place is very differently rendered by Interpreters, and thereupon ſeveral different Expoſitions are given of it. The words which we tranſlate, <hi>in the purpoſes thereof,</hi> are in the Hebrew, <hi>in the foundations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And ſo in the latter clauſe, thoſe words which we tranſlate <hi>ponds for fiſh,</hi> are in the Original, <hi>ponds of the ſoul,</hi> or, <hi>of ſouls:</hi> Whereby ſome think is meant, not ponds of living things, or <hi>ponds of fiſh,</hi> (as it is beſt rendered in our Tranſlation) but ponds made for delight and pleaſure. Now they that thus render the words of this verſe, do accordingly underſtand it of the great task impoſed upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by thoſe twelve Tyrants, that had divided the land amongſt them, in digging and making that huge Lake of <hi>Moeris,</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> (mentioned before in the Note, ver. 5.) which was three thouſand and ſix hundred Furlongs in compaſs, and in making channels and water-courſes for the conveying of the waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> into the ſaid Lake. And the meaning
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42788:111"/>
of the place they would have to be this, That the poor people of the Land that were imployed in making theſe huge works, meerly for the delight and pleaſure of their great Lords, ſhould be <hi>broken in the foundations thereof;</hi> that is, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them ſhould miſerably periſh, being ſlain and broken to pieces by the falling down of the foundations of the earth upon them. But now in our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that which is in the <hi>Hebrew, in the foundations thereof,</hi> is rendered <hi>in the purpoſes thereof;</hi> becauſe projects or purpoſes are the foundation of action. And the words being read thus, as they are in our Bibles, <hi>And they ſhall be broken in the purpoſes thereof, all that make ſluces and ponds for fiſh,</hi> the meaning muſt needs be, either 1. That thoſe that lived by the fiſh of <hi>Nilus;</hi> and to that end <hi>made ponds</hi> to keep fiſh in, and <hi>ſluces</hi> to let the waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> into thoſe <hi>ponds,</hi> ſhould be miſerably broken and undone by the purpoſes and projects of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Lords thereof, in draining the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> as is before ſaid; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there ſhould follow ſuch a failing of the waters, to the marring of their Trade of fiſh: or by their own purpoſes, in advancing thoſe to be their Kings that ſhould ſo miſerably oppreſs them: Or elſe, 2. That they ſhould be broken in their purpoſes and projects for the great gain they expected to make of the fiſh they reſolved to have always in a readineſs in the ponds they digged for that purpoſe, and that becauſe by the failing of the waters they would be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their hopes. As before he ſhewed, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. that there ſhould be no catching of fiſh; ſo here, that there ſhould be no keeping of fiſh in the dams and ponds, which to this end they had prepared.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Surely,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet doth again return, farther to ſet forth that which he had ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. concerning the Lords infatuating the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> for which ſee the Note there. <hi>Surely the Princes of Zoan are fools;</hi> and <hi>Zoan</hi> was one of the Royal Cities of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.12. It is as if he had ſaid, Let them think never ſo highly of themſelves, and let others admire them never ſo much for their great wiſdom, yet ſurely they are fools. Yea, not only their Princes and Nobles are fools, but even the wiſeſt of their Counſellors alſo (whereas thoſe that are eminent above others for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are uſually choſen to be of a Kings Privy-Council): And therefore is that added, <hi>the counſel of the wiſe counſellors of Pharaoh is become bruitiſh:</hi> by their ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh doings they carry themſelves more like brute beaſts than underſtanding men. And this he chargerh them with, to imply, 1. That their Land was like to be impoveriſhed and deſtroyed, not ſo much by the invaſion and power of foreign Enemies, as by their own fooliſh Counſels, and by the ſilly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed deſigns which they put their Kings upon, or wherein they flattered them, and ſoothed them up. 2. That now they were in danger, they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to foreſee, nor to prevent the ruin that was coming upon them. And 3. That being unable to do any thing that might procure Gods favour, which only could tend to true happineſs, their wiſdom in all other regards was no better than folly. <hi>How ſay ye unto Pharaoh, I am the ſon of the wiſe, the ſon of ancient Kings]?</hi> This the Prophet ſpeaks to the Princes and Counſellors of the King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſome would reſtrain it to <hi>Sithon,</hi> a fooliſh King, who they ſay, was invaded by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and others to <hi>Pſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

upon <hi>Egypt.</hi> But it is better, I think, to underſtand it of their Kings in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However, either it may be taken as an expreſſion of the way, how they flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their King, labouring thereby to puff him up with a vain conceit of his own eminent wiſdom, and of the antiquity of his ſtock, drawn down by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line through many generations; <hi>How ſay ye unto Pharaoh, I am the ſon of the wiſe, the ſon of ancient Kings?</hi> That is, why do ye preſcribe this form of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to him? Why do ye perſwade him to ſay thus of himſelf, as if becauſe of this he muſt needs be well inſtructed; or as if Wiſdom, together with his Regal Power, were his by inheritance, and that therefore there was no cauſe why he ſhould fear any foreign Power? Or elſe it may be taken, as ſpoken to their King by way of vaunting of their own great Wiſdom, thereby commending themſelves to him, that they might procure the greater reſpect to their counſel; <hi>How ſay ye unto Pharaoh?</hi> That is, with what face can you that are <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Princes and Counſellors, ſay every one of you to him in a boaſting way, <hi>I am the ſon of the wiſe, the ſon of ancient Kings?</hi> That is, I have been the Scholar of wiſe men (as thoſe that were trained up in the Schools of the Prophets, were called <hi>the ſons of the Prophets;</hi> ſee the Note 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.35.) or literally, I am deſcended from wiſe men and ancient Kings, becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> boaſted much of their great Learning, as if all Nations had received the knowledg they had in all Arts and Sciences from them; and likewiſe of the antiquity of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Kingdom, that they were many thouſand years before any other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which they grounded upon this pretence, that <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there was no rain, was not drowned, as the reſt of the world was in the general deluge); and becauſe the ancient Kings of thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, were men of eminent Wiſdom and Learning, and had left many Monuments thereof behind them, and that eſpecially for Magick and Divination; and ſo others in after-times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves their Scholars, or that they were of their Families; therefore the Prophet derides them for their vain boaſtings, <hi>How ſay ye unto Pharaoh, I am the ſon of the wiſe?</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid, Why do ye brag thus, as if you were ſure to defend the Kingdom by your Wiſdom, whereas the event will indeed be, that you will deſtroy it by your fooliſh counſels?</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Where are they?</hi> &amp;c.] This the Prophet ſpeaks to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by way of inſulting over him. <hi>Where are they?</hi> That is, they that boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted themſelves to be the Sons of the wiſe, and of ancient Kings? Ver. 11. <hi>Where are thy wiſe men?</hi> That is, thy wiſe Counſellors, thy Wizzards and Diviners, that pretend to ſo much skill in foretelling future things? What is become of theſe men now? Why do they not appear in this time of thy great danger? <hi>And let them tell thee now;</hi> that is, As becomes wiſe and faithful Counſellors, let them adviſe thee of the evil that is coming upon thee, and what thou ſhouldſt do to prevent it: <hi>And let them know what the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed upon Egypt;</hi> that is, let them ſee if they can find out, and ſo tell thee, what God hath determined to do unto <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Princes of</hi> Zoan <hi>are become fools, and the Princes of</hi> Noph <hi>are deceived,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note before, ver. 11. This <hi>Noph</hi> was another of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypts</hi> Chief and Royal Cities, the ſame that is elſewhere called in the Hebrew <hi>Moph, Hoſ.</hi> 9.6. Where by our Tranſlators it is rendered <hi>Memphis,</hi> as it is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42788:112"/>
commonly called by profane Writers, near unto which the Pyramids were built, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Barbara pyramidum ſileat miracula Memphis;</hi> And it is thought to be the ſame, that at this time is called <hi>Grand-Cairo.</hi> Now having ſaid that the Princes of this City were <hi>deceived,</hi> to wit, by the proud and high conceit which they had of themſelves, or by the juſt Judgment of God upon them, he adds, <hi>They have alſo ſeduced</hi> Egypt; that is, the people of <hi>Egypt</hi> by their Flatteries and fooliſh Counſels, and falſe Predictions of peace and proſperity, yea by their not foretelling the calamities that were coming upon them: <hi>Even they that are the ſtay of the Tribes thereof;</hi> that is, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces or Precincts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the Prophet in calling them <hi>Tribes,</hi> ſpeaks only after the language and cuſtom of his own Country. It is in the <hi>Hebrew, Even the corners of the tribes thereof;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, all <hi>Egypt</hi> from one end to the other: Or rather, the Princes thereof. And that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſeems to be, that the Princes of <hi>Zoan</hi> and <hi>Noph,</hi> that were by their place to have been the ſupport and glory of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the corner-ſtones are the ſupports and beauty of a building, were the men that had deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the land. See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. and Job 38.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The Lord hath mingled a perverſe ſpirit in the midſt thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the <hi>Hebrew, a ſpirit of perverſities;</hi> that is, an erring, fooliſh, giddy mind or ſpirit, carrying them away into crooked and croſs counſels and courſes, and putting them upon doing things contrary to all reaſon, and to what they intended, tending to the ruin of their State, which they thought to advance. In the Phraſe here uſed, <hi>The Lord hath mingled a perverſe ſpirit;</hi> there ſeems to be an Alluſion to the mingling, preparing, or giving to men a cup of Wine or ſtrong Liquor (ſee the Notes, Chap. 5.22. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2.) whereinto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is put that makes men giddy-headed, or outrageous and mad. And indeed the Judgments of God upon wicked men are often compared hereto in the Scripture, ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.3. and 75.8. And thence it followeth here, <hi>And they have cauſed Egypt to err in every work thereof;</hi> That is, to miſtake and act fooliſhly in every thing they do; <hi>as a drunken man ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth in his vomit;</hi> that is, as a man that ſtaggereth, that is ſo extremely drunk, that he goes up and down vomiting as he goeth; or as a man tumbles about in his vomit. As the more ſuch a man rowls himſelf in his vomit, the more he is defiled; ſo the more buſling they ſhall make, the worſe and worſe their condition ſhould ſtill be. The meaning of all is, That it was no wonder, though the wiſe men of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould thus play the fools, becauſe the Lord ſhould infatuate them.</p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the Land of Judah ſhall be a terror unto Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] As if the Prophet had ſaid, Yea, before the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhall invade <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> ſhall hear of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> prevailing in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the great havock they had made there, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had ſent the Treaſures of his Kingdom and of the Temple to him, and had tendered to become his Tributary Vaſſal, and yet could not by all this purchaſe. Peace from him, (concerning all which ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.13, 14.) this ſhall exceedingly affright the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the land of <hi>Judah</hi> being thus ſorely afflicted and endangered ſhall be a terror unto the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>Judea</hi> being ſuch a near neighbouring Country, and ſtanding as a wall between them and the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the land of <hi>Judah</hi> being ſubdued, there would be a clear way opened for the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to enter <hi>Egypt,</hi> and little hope there would be that they alone ſhould be able to withſtand ſuch a potent Enemy. 2. Becauſe of the ſtrict Confederacy that had often been betwixt theſe two States of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and the readineſs of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> upon all occaſions to help the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.4. and 18.21.) which might provoke the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> the more againſt <hi>Egypt.</hi> And 3. Becauſe if God had not ſpared his own people, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> might well think that he would much leſs ſpare them. This I conceive is the true meaning of this place. And accordingly it followeth, <hi>Every one that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention thereof, ſhall be afraid in himſelf;</hi> That is, every <hi>Egyptian</hi> (yea, ſome extend this to all other Nations) that ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> to wit, of the miſeries that are befallen that Country, ſhall be ſtruck with terror; the very thinking of the place ſhall make them tremble; <hi>Becauſe of the counſel of the Lord of Hoſts, which he hath determined againſt it;</hi> that is, becauſe of God's determinate Counſel for the deſtruction of the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> which they ſhall ſee executed upon it: Or, becauſe by the ruin brought upon the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> they ſhall ſee that he hath determined alſo to deſtroy <hi>Egypt.</hi> Some I know underſtand this whole verſe of the fear where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould be ſurprized, when they ſhould hear how wonderfully God had deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, that under <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had invaded <hi>Judea;</hi> to wit, that finding hereby what a mighty God the <hi>Jews</hi> had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, they ſhould not only fear the Lord; but alſo the people of the Lord, according to that which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid of old, Exod. 14.25. <hi>Let us flee from the face of Iſrael; for the Lord fighteth for them againſt the Egyptians:</hi> and that, Deut 28.10. <hi>And all people of the earth ſhall ſee that thou art called by the Name of the Lord, and they ſhall be afraid of thee.</hi> See alſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.23.

That is, after theſe judgements have been fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. <hi>ſhall five cities in the land of Egypt ſpeak the language of Canaan;</hi> that is, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, the language which the people of God ſpake, that were planted by God in the Land of <hi>Cannaan;</hi> which is therefore alſo called <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>language, Neh.</hi> 13.24. See the Note alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1. But the meaning is, that the inhabitants of certain Cities in <hi>Egypt</hi> (ſuch as God had ordained unto life eternal) ſhould embrace the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and become one people with them, profeſſing the ſame Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing together with them, as if they had been the ſame people, and ſpake all the ſame tongue (notwithſtanding the deadly enmity that had formerly been between the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> of which ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.32.) Yea, and that they ſhould by their praying to God, and praiſing of God, and by the holineſs of their ſpeech in every regard, manifeſt themſelves to be the people of the Holy God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to that; <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Then will I turn to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a pure language, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> As for the number of <hi>five cities</hi> here mentioned, <hi>In that day ſhall five cities in the land of Egypt ſpeak the language of Canaan;</hi> I do not think that this is ſpoken with reference to the five Principalities that were formerly in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.4. (for in the times the Prophet was immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaking of, <hi>Egypt</hi> was divided into Twelve Kingdoms). Nor that the Prophets intent was hereby to imply, that a fith part in five of the Cities of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> ſhould embrace the Faith (which ſome hold), becauſe of the following clauſe, <hi>one ſhall be called the City of destruction.</hi> It is only, I conceive, a certain number put for an uncertain; and that which is only intended is, that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould embrace the Religion of Gods people. And becauſe he ſpeaks of the converſion of Cities in general, this muſt needs be meant of their converſion to the Faith in the days of the Goſpel; not of ſome few that might be won to embrace the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion in the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, by thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhould fly into <hi>Egypt</hi> for ſhelter, upon occaſion of any troubles that ſhould be in the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi> And ſo likewiſe we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe following words, <hi>and ſwear to the Lord of hoſts;</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould by being baptized, renounce all idolatries, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice of the true God, even as Subjects are wont to take an Oath of Fealty and Allegiance to their earthly Princes, as owning the Lord to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Omniſcient God, and the Judg of the world, that will be avenged on all perjured perſons, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.11. And then for the laſt clauſe, ſome read it as it is in the Margin, <hi>one ſhall be called the city of the ſun:</hi> and ſo they take the meaning to be, that <hi>the city of the ſun,</hi> where there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built to the Sun, one of the chief Idols of the <hi>Heathens</hi> (which they take to be the ſame that is by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Heliopolis</hi>), ſhould be one of thoſe Cities that ſhould ſpeak the Language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that the Prophet's intent is hereby to ſignifie, that even thoſe that were moſt addicted to Idolatry, ſhould embrace the Chriſtian Faith. But if we read it as it is in our Bibles, <hi>One ſhall be called the city of deſtruction,</hi> the meaning muſt needs be, either 1. That ſome few of the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould refuſe to embrace the Chriſtian Faith, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

faithful Cities, deſtined to eternal deſtruction: Or elſe, 2. That amongſt thoſe Cities that ſhould <hi>ſpeak the language of</hi> Canaan, there ſhould be ſome few, or <hi>one</hi> particularly, that for its former horrid idolatry, or for its ſtanding out long obſtinately againſt the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſhould be deemed a City near to deſtruction, or appointed to deſtruction, that ſhould yet afterwards embrace the Truth, and become, together with the reſt, the people of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>In that day ſhall there be an altar to the Lord, in the midſt of the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, in the very inmoſt parts of the land: but ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.2. The meaning is, that even in <hi>Egypt</hi> they ſhould worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſpiritual Goſpel-way, whereof the Altars and Sacrifices amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the time of the Law, were types and ſhadows; For thus it is uſual in the Old Teſtament to ſpeak of the worſhip of God in Goſpel-times, under thoſe expreſſions of the Rites and Ceremonies that were then in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, as in Mal. 1.11. <hi>My name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered to my name, and a pure offering.</hi> See alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.7. and <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. And hereto agrees that which followeth, <hi>and a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the border thereof to the Lord:</hi> That is, a pillar erected to the honour of the true God, or whereon there ſhould be engraven, <hi>To the Lord Jehovah;</hi> even as it was a cuſtom to ſet up pillars, as marks of the bounds of Countries and Kingdoms, whereon there uſed to be the Arms, or ſome other memorial of the Prince to whom the Country belonged. But there is doubtleſs an alluſion in theſe words to the pillars which the people of God were wont to ſet up, as monuments and memorials of ſome ſpecial mercies they had there received from God, or of their worſhipping of God there: See the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.4. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.26, 27. So that the meaning of that which is here ſaid, is only this, That all <hi>Egypt</hi> over; yea, in the very border and out-skirts of the Country, in the pure exerciſes of Gods worſhip, and other monuments and tokens of Chriſtian piety, there ſhould be ſuch evident ſigns of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſetled there, that as ſoon as any man ſhould enter into the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſhould preſently ſee, that they owned the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be their God, and that the true Religion was profeſſed there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That Altar (and conſequently alſo that Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar), ſet up in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe, <hi>ſhall be for a ſign and for a witneſs unto the Lord of hoſts in the Land of Egypt:</hi> That is, they ſhall be a ſign, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> do own themſelves to be his peculiar people, and that he is worſhipped there. And what is meant by the Altar and Pillar, is ſhown in the foregoing Note; to wit, the open profeſſion they ſhould make of their Faith, and their thankful acknowledgment of the free Grace of God, in bringing them into a ſtate of Salvation, together with the ſervice which they ſhould conſtantly and openly yield unto God in praying to him, and praiſing his Name.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42788:114"/>
Lord for deliverance; which may ſeem the more probable, becauſe of that which follows, <hi>and be ſent them a ſaviour;</hi> to wit, Jeſus Chriſt. And again, others underſtand it of Tyrants that oppreſſed them in their outward eſtate; but withal hold, that this is mentioned as the occaſion of their turning to the true God; to wit, that being ſorely afflicted hereby, and finding no help in their Idol-Gods, they ſhould hereby be the better fitted and prepared to turn unto the true God, when, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, Grace came to be tendered unto them; whereupon that followeth, <hi>and he ſhall ſend them a ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and a great one</hi> (that is, a great Saviour, <hi>the great God and our ſaviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>and he ſhall deliver them.</hi> But I rather think, that this is ſpoken of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> after their converſion, and that this is added, to ſhew how thoſe ſigns of their worſhipping the true God ſhould come to be every where ſeen amongſt them (<hi>the Altar</hi> and <hi>the Pillar</hi> intended in the foregoing Verſe); namely, becauſe under all their oppreſſors they ſhould cry unto the Lord; and their Saviour, the Lord Chriſt, ſhould ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And the Lord ſhall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians ſhall know the Lord in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] The ſame thing ſeems to be ſaid here two ſeveral ways, and that becauſe this of their being brought to the true knowledg of God, was a mercy of ſo great importance, even the foundation of all their bliſs and happineſs; yet two diſtinct things may be implied hereby, as 1. That God ſhould reveal himſelf to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel. And 2. That hereby, through the enlightning of Gods Spirit, they ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually be brought to know the Lord; and ſo God that was before known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Judea,</hi> ſhould be now known in <hi>Egypt</hi> too. Or by the firſt clauſe may be meant, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould be brought to the knowledg of God; and by the ſecond, that they ſhould make acknowledgment of that God whom they now knew, by ſerving him in a Goſpel-way, which is expreſſed figuratively in thoſe following words, <hi>and ſhall do ſacrifice and oblation,</hi> &amp;c. for which ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſmite Egypt, he ſhall ſmite and heal it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, His ſtrokes ſhall not be mortal and deſtructive, becauſe after he hath ſmitten them, he ſhall heal them again: Or rather, he ſhall ſmite them ſo, that by ſmiting them, he ſhall heal them; to wit, ſpiritually, by working a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of grace in them. And this may be meant, either of the evils above mentioned, which ſhould be an occaſion of their converſion, or of thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby after their converſion God ſhould ſeek to reclaim them, when they went aſtray. And to both theſe may that alſo be referred which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>and they ſhall return even to the Lord, and he ſhall be intreated of them, and ſhall heal them;</hi> to wit, by delivering them out of their troubles.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>In that day ſhall there be a high-way out of Egypt to Aſſyria; and the Aſſyrian ſhall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Theſe two Nations that had formerly been in continual hoſtility one againſt the other, ſhall both embrace the Chriſtian Faith; and ſo then they ſhall be at peace, and there ſhall be free commerce between them, and loving communion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in matters of Religion. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.13, 16. <hi>and the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians

ſhall ſerve with the Aſsyrians:</hi> that is, They ſhall both ſerve one and the ſame God joyntly together, with one and the ſame worſhip, after one and the ſame way. Yet there are ſome that would have this underſtood alſo of their being ready to <hi>ſerve one another in love,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>In that day ſhall Iſrael be the third with Egypt and with Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, A third with thoſe, amongſt whom this mutual Concord and Amity ſhould be. The meaning is, that whereas hitherto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from all other Nations, as being God's only peculiar people, now there ſhould be no diſtinction betwixt Jew and Gentile; the believing Jew ſhould now own the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> (and under theſe all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are comprehended) as the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, no leſs than themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them in all brotherly Love, as ſuch. Yet I know ſome conceive that there is more than this intended in theſe words, that <hi>Iſrael ſhall be the third with Egypt and with Aſſyria;</hi> namely, That <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe land lay between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſhould come in, as it were, as a third perſon, to make peace between the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> to wit, by bringing them to be joyned together in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith under Chriſt their Head, as one Church and one People; ſo that whereas formerly <hi>Iſrael</hi> had wont to be the occaſion of war between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> by imploring ſometimes the aid of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſometimes the aid of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> now he ſhould be a means of uniting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in holy Love and Communion; as with themſelves, ſo alſo one with another. And this indeed ſeems to be the more probable, becauſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>even a bleſſing in the midſt of the land.</hi> For this ſeems to have ſpecial reſpect to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be <hi>a bleſſing,</hi> that is, a means of conveying a bleſſing to all the Nations in the world round about them: both in regard of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was to ſpring from them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their means the Nations ſhould be converted and brought in to be God's people: Or, that they ſhould be a form and pattern of bleſſing. For all which ſee the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.17. Yet I confeſs this laſt clauſe may be extended to all the three before-mentioned; to wit, that <hi>Iſrael, Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be <hi>a bleſſing in the midſt of the land:</hi> That is, that they ſhould be Nations bleſſed of God through Chriſt, whereto agrees that which followeth in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Whom the Lord of Hoſts ſhall bleſs,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, effectually, <hi>ſaying, Bleſſed be Egypt, my people,</hi> to wit, no leſs than <hi>Iſrael</hi> had formerly been; <hi>and Aſſyria the work of mine hands,</hi> to wit, in regard of Regeneration, God's <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,</hi> as ſuch are called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>IN the year,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet having before denounced the Judgments that were to come upon the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> Chap. 18. and the Judgments that were to come upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Chap. 19. doth in this Chapter again joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together foretel the calamities that were coming upon both theſe Nations, and withal expreſſeth the time when he foretold this; <hi>In the year that Tartan came unto Aſhdod, (when Sargon the King of Aſſyria ſent him) and fought againſt Aſhdod and took it.</hi> Some think that it is <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> who carried away the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> captive into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that is here called <hi>Sargon,</hi> and that he ſent <hi>Tartan</hi> againſt <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> who accordingly ſubdued and took it, about the fourth or fifth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kin. 18.9, 10. And others conceive, that this <hi>Sargon</hi> was the Son of <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> and Father of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and that he deſiring to proſecute his Fathers deſigns, and to enlarge his Dominions, did invade the land of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> that bordered on the Weſt upon the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and beginning with <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> beſieged that (the ſiege whereof might laſt three years, as <hi>Samaria</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.5.) and that when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> came in with great Forces to the relief of this City, they were by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> vanquiſhed and carried away captives in that ſhameful manner, as is here afterward related. But becauſe, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tartan</hi> is mentioned to have been one of thoſe three Captains, or Colonels, that were ſent by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> to ſummon <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to render up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to him; therefore it is more generally held, that this <hi>Sargon</hi> was <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> (it being uſual in thoſe times for men to have two ſeveral names) and when he firſt invaded <hi>Judea,</hi> in the fourteenth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kin. 18.13. he had amongſt other the ſtrong Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> taken <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> by ſome forces ſent againſt it under the command of <hi>Tartan,</hi> (which they conceive was one of the Cities that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had lately recovered out of the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 2 Kin. 18.8.) and that in this year it was that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was appointed to foretel the deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> which they conceive came to paſs three years after (ſee the Note here, ver. 3.) when <hi>Tirhakah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> came out againſt <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> being then waſting the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and was vanquiſhed by him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.9. Thus, I ſay, many Expoſitors do judge of the time of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But however clear it is, that the drift of this Prophecy was more fully ſtill to convince the <hi>Jews,</hi> what a folly it would be in them to rely upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> for help, that could not defend themſelves from the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And indeed conſidering how in that Invaſion of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the land of <hi>Judea</hi> was in a manner wholly ſubdued, (excepting only <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) it is moſt probable that the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to their wonted manner, began then to look after the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and their Confederates the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> for aid, (and

therefore we ſee that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> did upbraid them herewith, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.) and that they were much encouraged herein, when they heard that <hi>Tirhakah</hi> was indeed come out againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was already forced to ſend forth part of his Army out of <hi>Judea,</hi> to ſtop him in his way. So that upon this account it was neceſſary to convince the Jews, at this time, of their Sin and Folly, in reſting with ſo much confidence upon theſe Nations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>At the ſame time ſpake the Lord by Iſaiah, the Son of Amoz, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning is, That when God commanded <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that which followeth, he did withal charge him to acquaint the people, that it was by the Lords ſpecial command that he did ſo. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>The Lord ſpake by the hand of</hi> Iſaiah, that is, by the Miniſtry of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as it is ſaid, Levit. 8.36. That Aaron <hi>and his Sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of</hi> Moſes. Yet ſome think that this expreſſion might be uſed with reſpect to the cuſtom of the Prophets writing their Prophecies. <hi>Go and looſe thy ſackcloth from off thy loins;</hi> that is, The ſackcloth, ſay ſome, wherewith the Prophet was clothed at that time, purpoſely as a token of his bewailing the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, and the dreadful calamities that he foreſaw were coming upon the whole land of <hi>Judea,</hi> for the wickedneſs and ſtubbornneſs of the people left therein. And to the ſame purpoſe might that alſo be enjoyned which follows, <hi>and put off thy ſhoe fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But rather the <hi>ſackcloth</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was that rough hairy garment, which was the uſual attire of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, See the Note 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.8. And why he was enjoyned to put this off, is ſet forth in the two following verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he did ſo, walking naked and bare-foot.]</hi> That this was not done in a Viſion only, as ſome think, is evident; becauſe in doing this, he was to be a ſign to the people, to repreſent in their ſight the miſery that was coming upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> in whom they truſted. And that he went not up and down ſtark naked, the immodeſty and impudency of ſuch an act may eaſily convince us; but beſides, had he been ſtark naked, what need would there have been of adding that of his going bare-foot, <hi>Walking naked and bare-foot?</hi> The meaning therefore muſt be, either that he did only put off, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's appointment, his Prophetical outward Garment or Mantle, which covered all his body, and went up and down only in ſome ſhort cloſe Coat, that he uſed to wear under that, for which ſee the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. Or elſe, that having put off his Sackcloth, he walked up and down, not only bare-footed and bare-legged, but alſo in ſuch poor, ragged, torn and tattered garments, that in many places did not cover his naked body, juſt as Slaves and Captives uſed to go; thereby to repreſent in what a pitiful manner the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſhould be carried away into Captivity. And though this were done only, as ſome think, when the Prophet went forth to foretel the miſeries that were coming upon theſe Nations; yet we may be ſure that ſuch a ſpectacle, in ſo grave and holy a Prophet, and one that was alſo of Noble Deſcent, muſt needs mightily affect the people, and make them eager to enquire what the meaning thereof ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment informed the people what God intended to ſignifie to them by that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42788:116"/>
his ſtrange attire, <hi>Like as my ſervant Iſaiah hath walked naked and bare-foot three years for a ſign and wonder upon Egypt and Ethiopia;</hi> That is, ſay many Expoſitors, for a three years ſign, a ſign that three years after that, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſhould juſt in that manner be carried away captives; Or, that their Countries ſhould be waſted, and they carried into Captivity for three years together. And the more clearly to expreſs this, ſome think that he went out in this manner prophecying three ſeveral times, or three ſeveral days. But of this ſuppoſition there is no neceſſity: For as <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s putting a yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neck but for one day, ſignified a Captivity of ſeventy years continuance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.2. ſo might <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s going naked and bare-foot ſignifie the Captivity of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> three years after, or for three years together, though he ſhould have done it but once. However, as the words are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our Bibles, they clearly hold forth, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> went naked and bare-foot three years together, as is ſaid in the foregoing Note. And indeed it is probable enough that he did ſo, the more to affect the people with that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſery that was coming upon theſe Nations, upon whom they relied for help.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>So ſhall the King of Aſſyria lead away the Egyptians priſoners, and the Ethiopians captives,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>Sargon</hi> or <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> ſee the Note before, verſ. 1. And if this were done when he vanquiſhed <hi>Tirhakah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> (which ſome think, as is there noted;) this ſheweth that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did then joyn with <hi>Tirhakah</hi> in that Expedition: <hi>Young and old, naked and bare-foot, even with their buttocks uncovered to the ſhame of Egypt,</hi> and ſo likewiſe of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi> And this is meant of their being aſhamed, not only of their nakedneſs, but alſo of their former Pride and Self-confidence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And they ſhall be afraid and aſhamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.]</hi> That is, The <hi>Jews,</hi> or whoever elſe they were that had relied on theſe Nations for aid, ſhall be ſtricken with terror, when they ſhall ſee theſe their Confederates cut off, and ſo might expect that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> would now uſe them as they had done the other; ſee the Note, Chap. 19.17. and withal they ſhall be aſhamed of their folly in their former hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them. And thus theſe Nations, that had been before the cauſe of their vain confidence and pride, ſhould now become the cauſe of their fear and ſhame.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And the inhabitant of this Iſle ſhall ſay in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Inhabitants of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> may alſo be included, as being a part of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Several Reaſons are, I know, given by Expoſitors, why this land ſhould be called an <hi>Iſle,</hi> which ſeem not to me to have the leaſt probability in them; as, becauſe <hi>Judea</hi> was the Lord's peculiar Inheritance, ſeparated from the reſt of the world, as an Iſland from the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; or becauſe it had the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>-Sea on the Weſt, the <hi>Red</hi>-Sea, <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> the Sea of <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi>-Sea on other ſides of it. But indeed the moſt that can be probably ſaid for this is, that it is called an <hi>Iſle,</hi> becauſe it bordered upon the Sea-coaſts. And conſidering that the word here uſed in the Original is in ſeveral other places of Scripture uſed, even concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Countries; I conceive it is better rendered here, as it is in the Margin of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42788:116"/>
our Bibles, <hi>And the inhabitant of this Countrey ſhall ſay in that day.</hi> However thoſe words, <hi>this Iſle</hi> or <hi>this Countrey,</hi> ſeem clearly to import, that the Prophet ſpeaks here of his own Country-men, that they ſhould ſay, <hi>Behold ſuch is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the King of Aſſyria.</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, You ſee what is become of thoſe Nations by whom we expected to be aided againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians; and how ſhall we eſcape?</hi> That is, If the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> have deſtroyed theſe mighty Nations, on whom we relied; how ſhall we eſcape their fury? They that were not able to ſecure themſelves, are no way likely to defend us. And indeed when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had vanquiſhed theſe their confederates, and over-run <hi>Judea,</hi> and was ſet down with a mighty Army before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> was deſperate enough in the eye of Reaſon, had not God miraculouſly delivered them.</p>

Several reaſons are given by Expoſitors, why it is here called <hi>the deſert of the ſea;</hi> as 1. That it is called a <hi>deſert,</hi> either 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a great <hi>deſert</hi> betwixt <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> and ſo the Prophet ſpeaks here of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as with reſpect to the <hi>deſert,</hi> beyond which it lay: Or 2. Becauſe though <hi>Babylon</hi> was a very rich and fruitful Country, yet there was a great and a vaſt deſert that lay between <hi>Chaldea</hi> and the land of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> the inhabitants whereof were the Enemy that was to break into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and to deſtroy <hi>Babylon.</hi> Or 3. rather, Becauſe by this invaſion of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which the Prophet here foretells, it was to be laid waſte and deſolate , and turned into a very deſert: ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.19.22. and ſo the land which had made <hi>the world a wilderneſs,</hi> was to be made a wilderneſs it ſelf. And 2. That it is called <hi>the deſertt of the ſea,</hi> either, 1. Figuratively, becauſe <hi>Babylon</hi> was like a huge ſea for the multitude of the people, and riches that were therein; a ſea of wealth, all the Nations and Kingdoms under that vaſt Monarchy bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their treaſures to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the Rivers do all pour their waters into the Sea; as likewiſe with reſpect to the turbulent temper of that State, that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quiet, but continually breaking forth with great rage againſt other Nations: and to her inſatiable covetouſneſs and ambition, being herein like the Sea, which is never full, though all the Rivers run into it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.7. Or elſe, 2. Literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that either with reſpect to the ſcituation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> near to the Banks of that greater River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> or to the huge fens and lakes which that River
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42788:117"/>
made in the land of <hi>Chaldea</hi> in ſeveral places, (whence is that expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 51.13. <hi>O thou that dwelleſt upon many waters</hi>) eſpecially after <hi>Nitocris,</hi> a Queen of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> had by diverting the river of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in deep Channels digged for that purpoſe, winding it up and down in ſeveral places, turned a great part of the Country into a very Fen, to ſtop the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that river, when it ran right forward; or as others ſay, purpoſely to prevent the breaking in of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> upon <hi>Babylon</hi> on that ſide of the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As whirlwinds in the South paſs through,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As Whirlwinds, that do uſually ariſe ſuddenly in the South (called therefore <hi>Whirlwinds of the South,</hi> Zech. 9.14. according to that, Job 37.9. <hi>Out of the South cometh the whirlwind</hi>) do paſs on with mighty violence, ſo that nothing can ſtand before them; <hi>So it cometh from the deſert, from a terrible land;</hi> that is, ſo this burden I am now to foretel, this heavy calamity that will light upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> cometh <hi>from the deſert, from a terrible land;</hi> which may be meant, either of that part of <hi>Chaldea</hi> about <hi>Babylon,</hi> which <hi>Nitocris</hi> had turned into a very Fen and deſert place, by drawing <hi>Euphrates</hi> into it; or of that <hi>Deſert</hi> which lay on the South, between <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> (through which indeed <hi>Cyrus</hi> was to paſs with his Army.) Or elſe of the land it ſelf of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Northerly parts whereof were waſte and mountainous, and might well be called <hi>a terrible land;</hi> becauſe theſe Nations were indeed a very fierce and ſavage people, See Chap. 13.17, 18. and the State of <hi>Babylon</hi> was very much afraid of them. That therefore, which is intended by this clauſe is, that as formerly the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had broke in like a violent Tempeſt upon <hi>Judea,</hi> ſo now the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould on a ſudden from the South break in like a violent Tempeſt upon <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>A grievous Viſion is declared unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that which he had before called <hi>The burden of the deſert of the Sea:</hi> And this begins in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, wherein the Prophet relates what the Lord had ſaid to him in the Viſion, <hi>The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherouſly, and the ſpoiler ſpoileth.</hi> Now ſome conceive that the firſt branch of this, <hi>The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherouſly,</hi> is meant of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and that the next, <hi>and the ſpoiler ſpoileth,</hi> is meant of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſhould thereby puniſh the treachery of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And others underſtand both the one and the other, of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and to ſhew how they dealt treacherouſly with the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> they tell us how ſome of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captains revolted to them, of which <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobrias</hi> are named, and did much help forward the taking of <hi>Babylon;</hi> Yea, ſome ſay, what can hardly be made good out of any Hiſtory, to wit, that the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were not only in League with the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> at that time when they invaded <hi>Chaldea,</hi> but alſo that they were upon a treaty of Peace with them when they took <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were invited by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> to a great Feaſt; and taking advantage of this, ſlew him, and ſurprized the City. But with moſt Expoſitors I rather think that this is meant of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and that it is prefixed as the cauſe, why thoſe grievous things that are here foretold, were certainly to come upon him; namely, becauſe the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> had dealt ſo treacherouſly with God's people, and had ſo ſorely ſpoiled
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42788:117"/>
them, and ſo continued ſtill to do, having the poor <hi>Jews</hi> in bondage amongſt them; and ſo God would now bring other Nations upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſhould deal as treacherouſly and cruelly with them. And hereupon (as before, Chap. 13.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the Lord doth as it were ſummon the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to go up and beſiege <hi>Babylon. Go up, O Elam;</hi> that is, O <hi>Perſian,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> which was a Province in <hi>Perſin,</hi> of which <hi>Shuſhan</hi> was one of the Royal Cities, ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.2. (And ſome think the <hi>Perſian</hi> is named firſt, becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was Commander in chief.) <hi>Beſiege, O Media;</hi> the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here uſed ſeems to imply, how eaſily it ſhould be done; it was but going up againſt them, and laying ſiege to the City, and it ſhould be preſently taken. And obſervable it is, that though it were about an hundred and ſeventy years ere this came to paſs, yet the Prophet ſpeaks of it, as if it were then doing, yea as if it were already done. <hi>All the ſighing thereof have I made to ceaſe;</hi> that is, the great ſighing which <hi>Babylon</hi> hath cauſed amongſt many Nations for many years together, but eſpecially amongſt mine own People, by her Oppreſſions and Cruelties, ſhall now come to an end, becauſe <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And thus the cauſe of her deſtruction is alſo implied, to wit, becauſe ſhe had been ſo ſavage and cruel to others, the poor captive Jews eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Therefore are my loins filled with pain,</hi> &amp;c.] I cannot conceive that this ſhould be, as ſome think, the words of the Church, expreſſing her ſighing, mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, for the miſeries ſhe endur'd by the treachery and cruelty of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> It is far more probable, which others ſay, That the Prophet doth here in his own perſon bewail the deſtruction, which by the Viſion he had ſeen, he perceived was coming upon the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.5. and 16.9. But becauſe of thoſe words in the following Verſe, <hi>the night of my pleaſure hath he turned into fear;</hi> I judg it far moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it is <hi>Babylon</hi> her ſelf that is here brought in, bewailing the ſad miſeries they endured when the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſurpriſed that City; <hi>pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth;</hi> ſee the Note, Chap 13.8. <hi>I was bowed down at the hearing of it:</hi> that is, when the tidings were brought of their marching towards us; <hi>I was diſmayed at the ſeeing of it:</hi> that is, when we ſaw them beſieging the City, or breaking in with all poſſible rage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty upon us. And obſervable it is, that the Prophet uſeth the ſame expreſſion here that is ordinarily uſed concerning women in travail, as when it is ſaid of <hi>Phinehas</hi> his Wife, 1 Sam. 4.19. that <hi>ſhe bowed her ſelf, and bewailed.</hi> See alſo the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 39.3. And indeed of this terror of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> we have a notable inſtance in <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s afrightment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. where it is ſaid, that <hi>his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loyns were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another;</hi> inſomuch, that ſome Expoſitors hold, that this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the perſon of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> particularly; and that the words of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>ſeeing</hi> here mentioned, are meant of the hand-writing which he ſaw on the wall, and the interpretation which he heard given of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>My heart panted, fearfulneſs afrighted me,</hi> &amp;c.] The firſt words, <hi>My heart panted,</hi> may be rendered as they are in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>My mind wandered:</hi> that is, it could not reſt in its place and poſture: my thoughts were diſturbed, and rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when they know not which way to turn themſelves: <hi>the night of my pleaſure hath he turned into fear unto me:</hi> that is, God, or the Enemy, hath turned the night which I uſed to long for, and delight in, becauſe of the pleaſing reſt I took therein, into a time of extream fear and terror. And under this all other things may be comprehended, that uſed to be pleaſant to them, but were now embittered by their afrightment. But moſt clearly was this verified in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> in that fatal night wherein <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> being ſecurely feaſting with his Princes and Concubines, and blaſpheming the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the City was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurpriſed, and he and his people were miſerably ſlain, and ſo that night of their great Jollity was turned into a night of extreme terrour to them. And herein they were juſtly repaid, that ſuffered not the poor captive <hi>Jews</hi> to reſt from their hard bondage, no not in the night ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Prepare the Table,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitors would have theſe firſt words to be the words of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> enjoyning his Servants to provide the Banquet, (which is meant of the Feaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.1.) and the Watchmen in the mean ſeaſon to obſerve from their Watch-towers what the enemy did, and heartening his Gueſts to eat, and drink, and be merry, without any fear of the enemy that had beſieged the City. <hi>Prepare the Table, watch in the Watch-tower, eat, drink:</hi> and then the following words, <hi>Ariſe ye Princes, and anoint the ſhield,</hi> they would have to be the words of the Prophet, encouraging the <hi>Medes</hi> to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this their feaſting ſecurely together, to betake themſelves ſuddenly to their arms, and to ſurprize the City. But I conceive it far more probable, that all the way the Prophet relates the hard Viſion he had ſeen; and ſo in theſe firſt words ſpeaks to the <hi>Babylonians, Belſhazzar</hi> and his Nobles, in an <hi>Ironical</hi> way deriding their ſtupid ſecurity, <hi>Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Ay, do, make all things ready for your ſumptuous Feaſt; ſo that the Watchmen do but look out the whilſt from their Watch-towers, that will be enough, do you in the mean time eat and drink freely, and be merry; and then in the next words he tells them what would be the ſad concluſion of this their Jollity, <hi>Ariſe ye Princes, and anoint the ſhield;</hi> for this is all one as if he had ſaid, that they would quickly hear a cry, to wit, either from the watchmen, or from the people, upon the enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the City. <hi>Ariſe ye Princes, and anoint the ſhield;</hi> that is, Arm, arm, ye Princes; this is no time for feaſting, the enemy is upon you; and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with your cups, make ready your weapons, and ſtand to your arms. For by anointing the Shield, I conceive is clearly meant, the making ready of their Arms, that they might go out to battel; and that the ground of this expreſſion is, that in thoſe times they uſed to anoint their ſhields with Oil, when they went out to war, not only thereby to make them bright and glittering, but alſo that their ſmoothneſs might cauſe the weapons that lighted upon them to glide away, and not ſo eaſily to enter them. Yet ſome I know hold, that in theſe words the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Princes are adviſed <hi>Ironically</hi> to ariſe and make them another King, that might be a ſhield to them inſtead of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> that was ſtaing or to ſubmit to their King <hi>Darius,</hi> Dan. 5.30, 31. For which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42788:118"/>Ver. 6. <hi>For thus hath the Lord ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet proceeds farther to relate the burdenſom viſion, which God had revealed unto him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that to aſſure thoſe to whom he ſpake, that what he had foretold, would certainly be (neither is there indeed any reaſon why we ſhould ſay with ſome others, that this was another Viſion; and ſo multiply Viſions needleſly, when all may as well be underſtood of the ſame Viſion) <hi>Go, ſet a Watchman, let him declare what he ſeeth.</hi> Becauſe when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold this Ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there was no appearance of the leaſt likelihood of any ſuch thing; therefore in the Viſion that he ſaw he was appointed to ſet a Watch-man upon a high Watch-Tower, that ſhould faithfully declare what from thence he deſcried. And this I conceive was to imply, that though at preſent there was no appearance of that which he foretold, yet he had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what as Gods Watchman, by the revelation of Gods Spirit, he had, as it were, from Heaven fore-ſeen coming upon the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and therefore though it were ſeen, as that which was afar off, yet aſſuredly it would come to paſs. And indeed upon this account, Prophets are often called Watchmen in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a Watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> There is much arguing amongſt Expoſitors concerning this <hi>Watch-man,</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhould ſet. Some think that all intended hereby, was, that he himſelf ſhould, as a Watchman from his Watch-Tower deſcry what God would reveal to him; and this they would make good from that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, ver. 10. <hi>That which I have heard of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, have I declared unto you.</hi> Again others ſay, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is here commanded to appoint ſome other Prophet, or ſome Son of the Prophets, as a Watchman to expect what God by Viſion would reveal to him concerning this buſineſs, and faithfully to relate what he had ſeen. But methinks it is clear, that all this is only a relation of what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had ſeen in his Prophetical Viſion, namely, that God bad him ſet a Watchman in a Watch-Tower, that ſhould faithfully make known what he ſhould ſee. And accordingly in the following Verſes, he tells us what this his Watchman did, in this his prophetical Viſion, both ſee and ſay.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And he ſaw a Chariot, with a couple of horſemen, a Chariot of Aſſes, and a Chariot of Camels,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Watchman, whom in his Viſion at Gods Command he had ſet in a Watch-Tower. Now the ſight here related, which this Watchman ſaw, ſome underſtand thus; that there was but one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot drawn by an Aſs and a Camel, and therefore called <hi>a Chariot of Aſſes, and a Chariot of Camels,</hi> and two horſemen riding thereon; which they ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi> But in our Tranſlation it ſeems to be clearly ſaid, That he ſaw three Chariots, one drawn by Horſes, whereon two horſemen rode, (beſides thoſe that were in the Chariot) or which was guided, or accompanied <hi>with a couple of horſemen;</hi> and the other two were drawn, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by <hi>Aſſes,</hi> the other by <hi>Camels.</hi> And ſome add too, That by the <hi>couple of horſemen</hi> that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the firſt Chariot, is meant two troops of horſemen. However, this which he ſaw was doubtleſs the Armies of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that were under the Command of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> to invade <hi>Babylon;</hi> and wherein there were a multitude of Horſes, and Chariots, and Aſſes, and Camels, partly for mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42788:119"/>
ſervice, and partly for the carriage of their baggage, and all manner of Proviſions for their Army, which muſt needs be exceeding great, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the many deſert places they were to march through, and the uncertain length of the ſiege of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was ſo ſtrong a City, the main thing they had in deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he hearkned diligently with much heed.]</hi> That is, The Watchman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, Ver. 6. proceeded to look about, and to hearken with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence, to ſee if he could diſcover any thing more, and that he might fully inform himſelf concerning that which he ſaw, as which way they bent their courſe, and what they intended to do. And conſidering that this Watchman did repreſent Gods Prophet, in his making known the deſtruction that was to come upon <hi>Babylon;</hi> hereby is implyed, how ſolicitouſly careful he was, fully to inform the people of all that God was pleaſed to reveal to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he cried, A Lion,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Watchman before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, perceiving the military forces approaching to <hi>Babylon,</hi> cried out, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is a Lion; And this is commonly thought to be meant of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who for his fierceneſs is compared to a Lion; as alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.44. <hi>Behold, he ſhall come up like a lion.</hi> But now the beſt of our Interpreters do read theſe words as it is in the margin of our Bibles; <hi>And he cried as a Lion:</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſay is, That being frighted with the ſight of ſuch a potent enemy, ready to break in upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> he cried out with an exceeding loud voice, like the roaring of a Lion; thereby as it were to waken the ſleepy <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and to make them ſenſible of the danger they were in; that ſo they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently betake themſelves to their Arms. Now the words that he ſpake with ſuch a loud voice, are thoſe that follow; <hi>My Lord, I ſtand continually upon the Watch-Tower in the day time, and I am ſet in my ward whole nights.</hi> And he began with making this profeſſion of his conſtant vigilancy and faithful diſcharge of his truſt, either to the Prophet that had ſet him in his Watch-Tower, or elſe to the Lord, who had appointed <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to do ſo (See the Note before, ver. 6.) that he might the better clear himſelf from being any way guilty of neglect, if there came any danger to the place where he was ſet to watch. And how this alſo did imply the diligence and faithfulneſs of the Prophet, ſee in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And behold here cometh a Chariot of men,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a Chariot or Chariots (taking the word collectively) wherein men uſe to ride; not a Chariot or Waggon uſed only for carriage. Here the Watchman before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, proceeds further to tell what he had diſcovered, (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) concerning forces that were marching againſt <hi>Babylon.</hi> Only ſome conceive that he ſpeaks here, as if he deſired to make known (the more fully to ſet forth the certainty of <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine) that the forces which he had before deſcried a far off, were, even whilſt he was ſpeaking thoſe few foregoing words to the Lord, drawn ſo high, that they were now, as it were breaking in upon <hi>Babylon. And behold, here cometh a Chariot of men, with a couple of horſemen,</hi> ſee the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Some indeed there are that do underſtand theſe Chariots and Horſemen, ſeen by the Watchman, of the people of God, flying out of <hi>Babylon</hi> with bag and baggage. But it is far more probable, that the Prophet doth all along foretel the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:42788:119"/>
                  <hi>And he anſwered and ſaid, Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think that this is ſpoken by the Watchman, as giving <hi>Babylon</hi> for loſt, upon the ſight which he had ſeen. But becauſe of this word <hi>(anſwered)</hi> I do rather think, that it was the man which the Watchman had ſeen in the Chariot, that ſpake this, as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the taking of <hi>Babylon:</hi> or, that it was the Prophet that had by Gods appointment in his Viſion, ſet this Watchman to watch upon his Watch-Tower. But that which ſeems moſt probable, is, That it was the Lord himſelf that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered this; thereby making known to the Prophet what the meaning was of all this Viſion which he had ſeen. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> The redoubling of the word, ſeems to imply, both that it ſhould be certainly and ſuddenly done; as likewiſe what a matter of wonder and joy it would be to thoſe that heard of it, and with what attention it was fit to be hearkned to; <hi>and all the graven Images of her gods,</hi> even thoſe which <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> had praiſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.4. <hi>he hath broken unto the ground;</hi> to wit, God, or the Enemy which God had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Perſian;</hi> and that either by way of making a prey of the Gold and Silver whereof they were made, or wherewith they were adorned; or by way of triumphing over them, as deſiring hereby to ſhew, that they had vanquiſhed, not only the people of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but their Gods too. Now this is added, not only to imply what was one great cauſe of <hi>Babylons</hi> downfall, to wit, her horrid Idolatry, and why her ruine was proclaimed with ſo much joy; but alſo as hinting to Gods people, that they ſhould beware that they did not ruine themſelves by the ſame ſin.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>O my threſhing, and the Corn of my Floor,</hi> &amp;c.] Some take this as ſpoken in the name of God to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that ſhe is called his <hi>threſhing,</hi> that is, that which was to be threſhed by him, even as corn is threſhed in the Floor (as appears by the ſecond clauſe, <hi>and the corn of my floor;</hi> or as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>the Son of my floor,</hi> that which comes out of the floor, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to explain the foregoing words) by way, of foretelling how ſhe was to be beaten and bruiſed by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> according to thoſe like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.14, 15. <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the men of <hi>Iſrael, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will make thee a new ſharp threſhing Inſtrument, having teeth: thou ſhalt threſh the mountains, and beat them ſmall, and ſhalt make the hills as Chaff.</hi> And <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.13, <hi>Ariſe and threſh, O Daughter of Zion.</hi> Becauſe the ruine of that mighty Monarchy of <hi>Babylon</hi> might ſeem impoſſible in the Eye of Reaſon; therefore the Lord ſpeaks thus to her, <hi>O my threſhing,</hi> &amp;c. to imply, that if God undertook to do it, (who is with reſpect hereto in the following words called, <hi>the Lord of Hoſts, and the God of Iſrael</hi>) it ſhould ſoon be done; as if he had ſaid, O <hi>Babylon,</hi> as thou haſt threſhed my people, and many other Nations, ſo thou ſhalt be now threſhed thy ſelf; Or, O <hi>Babylon,</hi> I will trample thee under my feet, as the Corn is trodden on in the floor: for in thoſe parts they uſed to tread out the Corn by the treading of men and oxen, and the drawing of Carts over it. And indeed in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.33. we find the Deſtruction of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> threatned under the very ſame figurative Expreſſion, <hi>The Daughter of Babylon is like a threſhing floor; it is time to threſh her; yet a little while and the time of her harveſt ſhall come.</hi> But yet I conceive it is the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom this is here ſpoken, <hi>O my threſhing, and the Corn of my floor.</hi> And becauſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42788:120"/>
words are clearly the words of the Prophet, <hi>That which I have heard from the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, have I declared unto you:</hi> therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this muſt be taken, as ſpoken by the Prophet too; and that in a way of pitying them for the ſad Condition wherein they would be, when they were Captives in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and yet withal, to chear them up againſt that time of their ſore Calamity. <hi>O my threſhing, and the Corn of my floor;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, O my much pitied Countrymen and Brethren, that have been ſo often threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Corn in the floor; and ſo are like to be again when you are Captives in <hi>Babylon;</hi> know for your Comfort that this which I have ſaid concerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall certainly come to paſs; <hi>that which I have heard of the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, have I declared unto you.</hi> And therefore you may be fully aſſured of it. Though God may threſh you for a time by wicked men that ſhall tyrannize over you, purpoſely to purge you from your ſtraw and chaff, to cut off the wicked from amongſt you, and to cleanſe you from your ſins; yet the time ſhall come, when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, as it hath been foretold. And it is a clear diſcovery of Gods Love, that he is pleaſed thus beforehand to reveal this to you. Some, I know, would have it, that the Prophet calls the <hi>Jews</hi> his <hi>threſhing,</hi> only becauſe he had foretold how ſorely they ſhould be afflicted in <hi>Babylon;</hi> according to that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. <hi>See, I have this day ſet thee over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy,</hi> &amp;c. But I think that which is before ſaid, is ſufficient for the ſatisfying of that Scruple.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>The burden,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.25. <hi>of Dumah,</hi> that is, the Inhabitants of <hi>Dumah.</hi> But now what place this <hi>Dumah</hi> was, againſt which this burdenſom prophecy was denounced, it is hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Many hold that by <hi>Dumah</hi> here, is meant <hi>Idumea:</hi> As, ſay they, <hi>Aram,</hi> in a ſhorter way of ſpeech, is called <hi>Ram,</hi> 1 Chron. 2.9. and ſo likewiſe <hi>Abram,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 32.2. ſo here <hi>Idumea</hi> is called <hi>Dumah;</hi> which may ſeem the more probable, becauſe in the following words wherein the Prophet begins to relate the burdenſom Viſion which he had ſeen concerning <hi>Dumah,</hi> there is mention made of <hi>Seir,</hi> which was in the Country of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.3. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.4. But now becauſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.14. we find, that one of the Sons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was called <hi>Dumah;</hi> and it is well known, that <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> poſterity ſeated themſelves in <hi>Arabia;</hi> therefore many of our beſt Expoſitors are of opinion, that there was ſome part of <hi>Arabia</hi> that was called <hi>Dumah,</hi> after the name of the Son of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and that it was theſe <hi>Arabians,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> inhabiting this Country of <hi>Dumah,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did here prophecy. And whereas it may be objected againſt this, with great ſhew of Reaſon, That <hi>v.</hi> 13. there followeth another Prophecy particularly directed againſt <hi>Arabia.</hi> To this they anſwer, That that might be againſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> inhabiting about <hi>Kedar;</hi> and this aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42788:120"/>
overturnings that were ſhortly to come upon all the Countries about them, were ordered and appointed by Divine Providence; and perhaps alſo that when troubles came upon themſelves, they might not think, as they were apt to do, of flying to <hi>Dumah,</hi> or elſewere, to ſecure themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He calleth,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins the Prophet's burdenſome Viſion againſt <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, He calleth to me out of Seir;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I hear the voice of one calling to me out of <hi>Seir.</hi> And the moſt Expoſitors take theſe to be the words of the Prophet, relating what he had heard in his Viſion concerning <hi>Dumah,</hi> as before he had related what had been revealed to him concerning <hi>Babylon.</hi> But becauſe theſe two ſhort Prophecies concerning <hi>Dumah</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> might well be revealed to him at the ſame time with that which he hath before related concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> I ſee not why this may not be added, as in ralation to that which went before, ver. 16. namely, as the words of that Watchman, whom in his Viſion God had appointed the Prophet to ſet in a Watch-tower, who having related before what he had ſeen concerning <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> doth now alſo tell, that he alſo heard one call to him out of <hi>Seir, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</hi> Only indeed what is meant hereby (whether we take them as ſpoken to the Prophet, or as ſpoken to that Watchman, or to any other) is very queſtionable. The opinions of Expoſitors herein are very different and many; I will only mention thoſe that ſeem moſt probable. They that hold the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Dumah,</hi> to be the perſons againſt whom the Judgment here threatned is denounced, can give no other reaſon why the Prophet, or the Watchman (in the Prophets Viſion) ſhould ſay, That one called to him <hi>out of Seir,</hi> but only this, that the <hi>Edomites</hi> are mentioned as making this enquiry, either as a people ready ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and prepared to go out upon a deſign of invading or ſurprizing <hi>Dumah,</hi> and therefore longing for break of day, that they might be upon their march; or elſe, becauſe being near neighbours to theſe <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> of <hi>Dumah,</hi> they were afraid of being involved in the ſame miſery together with them, and ſo were eagerly inquiſitive to know what the Watchman had in the night deſcried. But now if by the inhabitants of <hi>Dumah,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> be meant, then there can be no queſtion made, why their miſeries ſhould be foretold by the Prophet's or Watchman's relating what one ſaid that called to him out of <hi>Seir,</hi> and what he anſwered him. And indeed this makes me the more inclinable to think, that it is the <hi>Idumeans</hi> that are here meant by the inhabitants of <hi>Dumah.</hi> Only ſtill it is queſtionable what was intended by theſe words he heard, <hi>Watch-man, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</hi> Some hold, that this was ſpoken to the Prophet himſelf, as one of the Jews Spiritual Watchmen, and that Ironically, the words being redoubled to imply the greater deriſion, <hi>Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the Night?</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, Thou that profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be a Watchman, appointed by God to look out from thy Watch-tower, and foreſee the evils that are to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us and other Nations, what ſaiſt thou of that night of great tribulation and diſtreſs which thou, and other thy Fellow-Prophets, have often told us was coming upon us? You have often threatned us with a diſmal night of darkreſs and calamity that ſhould befal us, and yet we on the contrary do ſtill enjoy a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42788:121"/>
fair Sun-ſhining day of Peace and Proſperity, and ſo have done ever ſince we caſt off the yoke of your King <hi>Joram,</hi> and have had a King of our own; (See the Note, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.20.) And therefore what ſaiſt thou now? Haſt thou any farther tidings of this night that is to come upon us? Again others hold, that this is that which the <hi>Edomites</hi> ſaid to the Watchman, whom the Prophet in his Viſion had ſet upon a Watch-tower; and that hereby is repreſented in what continual perplexity and fear they were, by reaſon of the enemies that were waſting their Country, or were ready to break in upon them; for this which this Watchman relates as ſpoken to him, is to ſet forth how the <hi>Edomites</hi> were continally calling and crying thus to their Watchmen, <hi>Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</hi> That is, What have you ſeen concerning this Night? Hath the enemy attempted any thing againſt us? Or are they ready to aſſault us? Are we in a better or a worſe condition than we were? Or, What time of the night is it? Or, as if they had ſaid, fearing the enemy would by night break in upon them, When will it be morning? Or, When will the morning of our deliverance come? Shall the Enemy always thus make havock in our land? Yea, ſome underſtand it, as the cry of the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> being now carried away Captives by the <hi>Aſſyrians: Watchman, what of the night?</hi> That is, When will our Captivity come to an end? Is there no Day-light appearing? no hope of comfort? As for this redoubling of theſe words, <hi>Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this is done, Either, 1. after the cuſtom of thoſe that call to them that ſtand on ſome high place far above, who are wont to repeat the queſtions they propound to them, for fear at firſt they were not heard. Or, 2. to imply, That the Inhabitants of <hi>Dumah,</hi> by reaſon of their great anxiety and terrors, ſhould be continually wearying the Watchmen with this queſtion, ſometimes one of them, ſometimes another; or that they ſhould run up and down to make this enquiry of them. Or, 3. the better to expreſs their exceeding great fear and deſire to be ſatisfied of that, concerning which they enquired. And indeed this laſt Expoſition, that makes this enquiry of the Inhabitants of <hi>Dumah,</hi> to be an expreſſion of the great terror and fear they were in becauſe of the enemy, I judge moſt probable.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>The Watchman ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Prophet himſelf, or the Watchman that in his Viſion he had ſet in a Watch-tower: See the Note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ver. 16. as likewiſe the foregoing Note; for upon the underſtanding of the Queſtion there propounded, <hi>Watchman, What of the Night?

They that underſtand that as a ſcoffing Queſtion propounded by the <hi>Edomites</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by way of deriding him, becauſe he, and the other Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had often foretold that there was a night of great tribulation and diſtreſs coming upon the <hi>Edomites;</hi> whereas on the contrary they had enjoyed a fair Sunſhining day of Peace and Proſperity, ever ſince they had caſt off the yoke of <hi>Judah,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42788:121"/>
and then after that the Night cometh alſo; ſo it will be with you. It is true indeed that you have had a fair day of peace and proſperity; but know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that now there is a diſmal night of darkneſs and miſery, which as ſurely as the Night ſucceeds the Morning, ſhall ſhortly come upon you, to wit, by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that ſhall under the conduct of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> invade your land; (for this was prophecied, ſay they, before that King brake into <hi>Judea,</hi> at which time he alſo invaded the other neighbouring Countries.) <hi>If ye will enquire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ye: return, come.</hi> That is, If ye will enquire of me concerning the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God towards you, do it ſeriouſly, and not in a flouting way: <hi>Return</hi> from your evil ways, <hi>come</hi> and joyn your ſelves to us, God's peculiar people. But now they that take the Queſtion in the foregoing verſe, <hi>Watchman, what of the night?

Together with the morning, there will be ſtill a dark night of fear, and ſorrow, and miſery upon you: Or, you are ſtill wiſhing, Oh, that it were morning, hoping then to be rid of your fears: But alas, you deceive your ſelves in this; your miſeries are not like to be for a day, but of long continuance. After the break of day hath put an end to this night, another night will come, and ſo it will be ſucceſſively; and if you be not undone this night, it may be you will the next; both by night and by day you will ſtill be in danger. <hi>If ye will enquire, enquire ye;</hi> that is, if you will come to enquire of me day after day, and night after night, you may; but I ſhall give you ſtill the ſame anſwer: The ſame fears that do now perplex you, will ſtill be upon you. <hi>Return, come;</hi> that is, Go away, and come again to me as oft as you will, you will but loſe your labour, I ſhall ſtill ſay the ſame thing, and ſhall be able to give you no comfort at all. Yet theſe laſt words may be underſtood, as is before ſaid, as an exhortation to Repentance, <hi>If ye will enquire, enquire ye,</hi> that is, enquire of that which may be for your good; as if he ſhould have ſaid, Theſe fears and queſtions of yours are vain and to no purpoſe; If you will enquire, let it be how you may pacifie God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt you: <hi>Return, come;</hi> That is, return to God by Repentance, and joyn your ſelves to his people.</p>

companies of Dedanim,</hi> becauſe theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> uſed to travel in a way of merchandizing or otherwiſe, in great companies together; ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.25. and <hi>Job</hi> 6.19. However the meaning is, that for fear of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in upon their Country, theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> ſhould be glad to flee into woods and foreſts, there to hide and ſecure themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The inhabitants of the land of Tema,</hi> &amp;c.] A place in <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſo called, as is generally thought, from <hi>Tema,</hi> one of the Princes of the <hi>Iſhmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> Gen. 25.15. <hi>brought water to him that was thirſty;</hi> that is, to the <hi>Deda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims</hi> that inhabited ſome other part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and that fled at that time from the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and therefore it follows, <hi>They prevented with their bread him that fled;</hi> that is, of their own accord, without being ſent to, they brought them proviſion for their ſupport; for by <hi>their bread</hi> may be meant, either the bread of the Inhabitants of <hi>Tema,</hi> which they brought out of their ſtore for the relief of theſe their diſtreſſed Neighbours and Countrymen; or ſuch bread, ſuch proviſion, as was neceſſary for ſuch poor creatures, and was indeed due to them in their diſtreſs. This may be read indeed, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>O ye inhabitants of Tema, bring ye water to him that is thirſty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with your bread him that fleeth;</hi> and ſo it may be taken, either as ſpoken by God, exhorting the Inhabitants of <hi>Tema</hi> to relieve their poor brethren; or as the words of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that were fled from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> begging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe that dwelt thereabouts. But however, the drift of the Prophet here is to foretel, into what extreme poverty the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſhould be brought by the invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> to wit, that having neither bread nor water, either becauſe they were forced to flee in ſuch a fright, that they could not ſtay to take any proviſion along with them, or becauſe of the deſert places whereinto they fled, they muſt needs have periſhed with hunger and thirſt, (which was moſt like to afflict them in thoſe hot and dry deſerts) had they not been relieved by their brethren. And if it were <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> as is moſt commonly thought, that was invaded by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and that the people that were driven from thence, did flee into <hi>Arabia the Deſert,</hi> even this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is obſervable, that they were put upon being relieved by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that barren Country, that were themſelves very poor and beggarly.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For they fled from the ſwords,</hi> &amp;c,] That is, For fear of the Swords of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>For thus hath the Lord ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] Leſt that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had foretold concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſhould be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, becauſe they were ſuch a numerous, ſtrong and warlike people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this added, that he ſpake nothing but what God had revealed to him. <hi>Within a year,</hi> to wit, after the imparting of this Prophecy to you, <hi>according to the years of an hireling;</hi> See the Note before, Chap. 16.14. <hi>And all the glory of Kedar ſhall fail,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Kedarens,</hi> a people deſcended from <hi>Kedar, Iſhmael</hi>'s Son, that had ſeated themſelves in ſome part of <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> as that place ſeems to imply, Chap. 42.11. <hi>Let the wilderneſs and the Cities thereof, the Villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock ſing:</hi> But ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. And by the failing of their glory is meant, that deſtruction of the flower of their Nation, and the impairing of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42788:122"/>
their huge multitudes by the ſlaughter which the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. And indeed by the expreſs mention that is here made of the time when theſe calamities ſhould come upon them, to wit, <hi>mithin a year,</hi> it is moſt clear, that it muſt be underſtood of their being deſtroyed by <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi> at the ſame time when he invaded <hi>Judea,</hi> about the twelfth or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> For the deſtruction that was brought upon them by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> whereof <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.28. was above an hundred years after the time of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the reſidue of the number of Archers, the mighty men of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Kedar, ſhall be diminiſhed.] Archers</hi> are only mentioned, becauſe the <hi>Kedarens</hi> uſed and excelled moſt in this kind of Arms, being trained up it ſeems from the firſt original of their Nation, in this way of fighting; becauſe it is expreſly noted of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> their Progenitor, that <hi>He became an Archer,</hi> Gen. 21.20. But the meaning of the place is, That the remainder of their men of war, even all that were any way fit for any Military Service, ſhould be very ſmall; there ſhould be but a few left of them. Yet ſome think that this expreſſion, <hi>The reſidue ſhall be diminiſhed,</hi> doth import ſomewhat more, to wit, that thoſe few of their men of War that ſhould be left after their firſt overthrow, ſhould be diminiſhed more and more under the Tyranny of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and other Calamities that ſhould befal them.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THE Burden,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, Chap. 13.1. and 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Of the valley of Viſion;</hi> that is, of the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſay ſome, or of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſay others. I think both are intended. For though the miſeries here foretold ſeem chiefly to be directed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any calamity, that was coming upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt needs be a burden to the whole land, becauſe they ſo much relied upon this, That God's Sanctuary there, would be a Sanctuary to them all; and ſo by foretelling her miſery, the confidence of the whole Land herein muſt needs be ſorely ſhaken. <hi>Judea</hi> might be called <hi>a Valley,</hi> becauſe it was compaſſed about with high Mountains; and ſo might <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> too. For though the Temple, and a chief part of the City, ſtood on a Hill, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.1. yet the City it ſelf ſtood on a Plain, and was compaſſed about with high Hills, Pſal. 125.2. <hi>As the mountains are round about Jeruſalem, ſo the Lord is round about his people:</hi> and is therefore expreſly called a Valley, Jer. 21.13. <hi>Behold, I am againſt thee, O inhabitant of the Valley, and rock of the Plain.</hi> And <hi>a valley of Viſion,</hi> both of them might be called, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> eſpecially, becauſe God did, as it were, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly manifeſt himſelf to his people in his Temple there; and becauſe of the many and frequent Revelations and Viſions, whereby God did there make
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42788:123"/>
known his Will to his Prophets, who were thence called <hi>Seers,</hi> 1 Sam. 9.9. And ſome think likewiſe, that there might be ſome alluſion herein to the name of that City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſignifying a place where God ſeeth, or for which God will provide, ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. I know ſome add to this, that <hi>Judea</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called <hi>a Valley,</hi> becauſe this State was to be brought down from a great height of proſperity into a very poor and low condition. But whether this was intended or no, is very queſtionable. Rather it may be thought, that in this title, <hi>The valley of Viſion,</hi> there is covertly hinted a ſtrange contrariety betwixt this and other Valleys, in that other Valleys are the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, at leaſt not ſo lightſome, becauſe overſhadowed by the Mountains about them; whereas there was more light in this Valley than in other places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the light of God's word, that ſhined there ſo brightly amongſt the people. And withal hereby might be implied, That this great priviledg wherein they were wont to glory, of having ſo many Prophets, and ſo much light of God's Word, would not ſecure them from the judgments of God, but rather haſten them; becauſe they made no better uſe of this mercy, but ſtumbled ſo baſely, even in this <hi>Valley of Viſion.</hi> But now whether this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdenſome Prophecy be to be underſtood of the taking and ſacking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or of the diſtreſs it was brought into by <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is very hard to determine. The moſt Expoſitors by far do underſtand it of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And indeed, that which is here foretold from ver. 2. to ver. 8. doth import far more dreadful miſeries that ſhould befal <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> too, than what they endured by the invaſion of <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> as we may ſee by that which is ſaid ver. 2. of her ſlain mens not being ſlain with the Sword in battel; and ver. 3. of the flight of her Princes, and the captivity of all her people; and ver. 4. of the deſperateneſs of her condition, incapable of any comfort; and ver. 5. of the breaking down of her walls, &amp;c. all which was punctually fulfilled when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was laid in the duſt by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and not when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> But now on the other ſide, many of our beſt Expoſitors do judge it moſt likely, that it is the diſtreſs and deſtruction that befel the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in particular, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that is here intended. And true it is, that what is added from the 8th verſe, and ſo forward, doth ſo fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that which was done by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his Princes and people, for the defence of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.1, 2, 3, &amp;c. that it cannot well be queſtioned, but that our Prophet ſpeaks there of that very time. The concluſion therefore is, that I judge it moſt probable, that in this burdenſome Prophecy concerning <hi>The Valley of Viſion,</hi> the Prophet doth joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak both of the ſad condition <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were brought into by the invaſion of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and alſo of that utter ruin and deſolation that was at laſt brought upon them by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> But now whether this was prophecied before <hi>Sennacherib</hi> invaded <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſo that which is ſaid ver. 9, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. concerning the preparations made for the defence of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is ſpoken of as done already, only to imply how certainly it ſhould be done: Or whether it was prophecied after the invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſo it be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42788:123"/>
here, as ſome think, only to ſhew how juſt it would be with God ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deſtroy them by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> becauſe the calamities they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly undergone by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> had done ſo little good amongſt them. This I confeſs is ſtill very queſtionable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the houſe-tops?]</hi> To wit, To ſee the Enemy lying in ſiege about <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or rather, as flying thither in a great fright to ſave or hide your ſelves from the enemy? But for this fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the houſe tops, ſee further in the Note before, Chap. 15.3. It is clearly a Prophetical repreſentation of ſome great diſtreſs the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be brought into; as if it had been ſaid, What is the matter, that inſtead of ſtanding upon your guards to reſiſt your enemies, you are all fled to the houſe-tops? What is become of your former ſecurity and confidence, when you made ſo light of all the threatnings of God's Prophets? But what the diſtreſs is that is here intended, ſee the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Thou that art full of ſtirs, a tumultuous City, a joyous City,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be referred to the foregoing verſe, and ſo may be underſtood as if it had been ſaid, Thou that art a City ſo full of people, and by reaſon hereof ſo full of noiſe and tumult, ſtirring, and buſling, and running up and down about your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral buſineſſes and occaſions; and withal <hi>a joyous City,</hi> ſecure and fearleſs, and therefore full of Mirth and Jollity: How comes it to paſs, that having ſuch multitudes to reſiſt an enemy, yet ye are now fled all to the houſe-tops, as it was there ſaid, ver. 1? Doth not this clearly ſhew, that God hath taken away all courage from you? Or it may be referred to that which followeth, <hi>Thou that art full of ſtirs, a tumultuous City, a joyous City;</hi> That is, Thou that wert ſo, thou that wert ſo fearleſs and full of all kind of rejoycing, behold how thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſuddenly changed, <hi>Thy ſlain men are not ſlain with the ſword, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ead in battel;</hi> to wit, as valiant men ſhould be. And they that conceive, that it is the beſieging of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> that is here intended, do accordingly underſtand this of the peoples being ſlain and ſtruck dead, as it were, with very affrightment and fear. But they that think it is meant of the taking and ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which ſeems moſt probable) by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> do underſtand it thus, That being ſhut up within the walls, and not daring to go forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, they died there with Famine and Peſtilence; See the Note, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.3. Or elſe that, as is expreſſed in the following verſe, they fled baſely out of the City, and ſo were taken and ſlain, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>All thy Rulers are fled together,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Even thy Princes, that ſhould have hazarded themſelves for the defence of thy people, are fled for fear. And thoſe that think the Prophet is ſpeaking here of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> invading the Land in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> do underſtand this of the Captains and Rulers fleeing from all parts of the land, into other neighbouring Countries, or elſe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to ſhelter themſelves. And accordingly they alſo expound that which followeth, <hi>They are bound by the Archers,</hi> that is, They are ſurprized by the Archers, and bound and carried away priſoners; Or they are ſo bound up with terrour and fear of the Archers, that they dare not ſtand to defend themſelves: <hi>All that are found in thee are bound together,</hi> That is, All thy Inhabitants, Princes as well as the ordinary people, are fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42788:124"/>
with fear, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.5. Or they are here and there ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and impriſoned together: <hi>Which bave fled from far,</hi> That is, which are fled from the remoteſt parts of the Country to ſheltter themſelves in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> or elſewhere. But now thoſe that conceive the Prophet ſpeaks here of the calamities that were to be brought upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> do accordingly hold, that this, <hi>All thy Rulers are fled together,</hi> is meant, either of that expedition of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Jehoiachim,</hi> and his Princes and people were in great numbers carried away captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24.12, &amp;c. Or elſe of that which is expreſly recorded concerning that laſt Siege, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken and deſtroyed by him, to wit, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> with many of his Princes and men of war did flee ſecretly out of the City, even as far as the Plains of <hi>Jericho,</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.4, &amp;c. and were there taken, and either ſlain or carried into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and therefore it follows, <hi>They are bound by the Archers,</hi> that is, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Souldiers, that purſued and ſurprized them. And then the laſt words, I conceive, are meant of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe that were fled thither for refuge, <hi>All that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.</hi> And indeed I ſee not how the miſeries here foretold can ſuit ſolely with that which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> endured, when it was only ſtraitned and affrighted by <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, as will be more evident in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Therefore ſaid I,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think this is ſpoken as in the perſon of the land of <hi>Judea.</hi> But it is rather the Prophet that ſpeaks of himſelf; and that not only the better hereby to ſet forth the extreme miſeries that were coming upon <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (as before in the caſe of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> ſee the Notes, Chap. 15.5. and 16.11.) but alſo becauſe he was indeed excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly grieved for the doleful condition whereinto he foreſaw the Church and People of God would be brought; and that he might the more effectually move the <hi>Jews</hi> to repent of their wickedneſs, which otherwiſe would bring ſuch dreadful Judgments upon them. <hi>Look away from me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Be gone, let me alone, <hi>I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, becauſe of the ſpoiling of the daughter of my people;</hi> that is, my poor Countrymen, that are as dear to me, or as dear to God, as a Daughter to her Father. See the Note alſo Chap. 1.8. It is all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, The condition of my people is deſperate, there is no place for comfort. Now all this ſeems ſtill to import a more deſperate and comfortleſs condition, than that whereinto God's people were brought by <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, in the days of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5 <hi>For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.3. <hi>By the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> ſee the Notes, Chap. 10.5, 6. <hi>In the valley of Viſion,</hi> ſee the Note above, ver. 1. <hi>Breaking down the walls,</hi> that is, the enemies breaking down the walls of Cities and houſes. (And they that underſtand this of the havock made by <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army in the days of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> do apply it to the fenced Cities, which he took in the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.13. But others hold, that it is chiefly meant of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ſtorming <hi>Jeruſalem.) And of crying to the mountains,</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:42788:124"/>
that is, the ſhouting of enemies ſtorming and ſacking the City, that ſhall ring even to the Mountains; or the ſhrieking of the poor Jews, as they ran with great outcries to hide themſelves in the Mountains; or that ſhall be ſo loud, that they ſhall be heard even to the neighbour Mountains. Yea, ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this of men, who being in a deſperate condition, ſhall cry to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall on them, and to cover them, as it is expreſſed by our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.30.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> Elam <hi>bare the quiver,</hi> &amp;c.] Here ſome of the Nations are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that ſhould be imployed either by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> in their Expedition againſt <hi>Judea</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem. Elam bare the quiver;</hi> That is, the <hi>Perſians</hi> were there, (ſee the Note, Chap. 21.2.) who were eſpecially famous in thoſe times for Archery; whence is that, Jer. 49.35. <hi>Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might:</hi> (And obſervable it is, that this people that did now ſerve, perhaps, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> were afterwards imployed by <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 21.2.) As for that which is added, <hi>With chariots of men, and horſemen,</hi> ſee the Notes, Chap. 21.7, 9. <hi>And</hi> Kir <hi>uncovered the ſhield;</hi> That is, The men of <hi>Kir,</hi> the <hi>Medes,</hi> were alſo there with their glittering ſhields: For <hi>Kir</hi> was a City ſcituate in <hi>Media,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.5. and the Notes before, Chap. 15.1. Theſe it ſeems were as much renowned for fighting with Sword and Target, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> were for Archery. And becauſe they were wont to wrap up their Shields, when they uſed them not, in caſes or coverings, to keep them from duſt and ruſt, which they pulled off when they were to go forth to War, thence is this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the men of <hi>Kir's</hi> uncovering their ſhields.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that thy choiceſt valleys,</hi> &amp;c.] As if it had been ſaid, O thou <hi>Valley of viſion,</hi> thy richeſt and pleaſanteſt Valleys, even thoſe wherein happily thou hadſt thy Gardens and Orchards, thine Oliveyards and Vineyards, <hi>ſhall be full of chariots,</hi> lying in Siege about thee; <hi>And the horſemen ſhall ſet themſelves in array at the gate;</hi> to wit, by way of blocking up the City, or laying Siege about it, or making ready for an Aſſault.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he diſcovered the covering of Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] As this paſſage is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our Tranſlation, it muſt needs be meant either of God, or the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that invaded <hi>Judea,</hi> of whom it is here ſaid, That <hi>he diſcovered the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Judah.</hi> And becauſe of that which follows in the ſequel of this Chapter, ver. 15. concerning <hi>Shebna,</hi> who is commonly thought to have been a chief Officer in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Court, ſee the Note 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.18. it is moſt probable that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his days, is the enemy here intended. If we take it as ſpoken of God, then by his <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the covering of Judah,</hi> may be meant, either 1. that he would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their covering from them, and leave them naked, expoſed to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, (for Prophetically he ſpeaks of that which was to be, as if it were done already;) and by their <hi>covering</hi> may be meant, either that which might well have been <hi>a covering</hi> to them, to wit, his own protection, had they not forced him by their wickedneſs to withdraw it from them; or elſe that which they hoped would be a covering and ſafeguard to them, as the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (to which they fled from all parts of the land to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42788:125"/>
Or the Temple, (which they looked upon as an invincible Sanctuary to them:) Or their Riches, or ſtrong Fortifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to ſtrip them of. Or, 2. that he would <hi>diſcover</hi> their <hi>covering,</hi> that is, he would cauſe them to diſcover it, and bring it forth to light; to wit, by bringing an enemy upon them, that ſhould cauſe them in all haſte to run to their Armory and Magazine, that had been long ſhut up, to open it, and bring forth their Arms and Ammunition, wherein they hoped to ſecure themſelves from the attempts of their enemies againſt them. And thus underſtanding the words, the following clauſe may ſeem to be added, the better to explain this, <hi>And thou didſt look in that day to the Armor of the houſe of the foreſt.</hi> Or, 3. that he had <hi>diſcovered</hi> and found out (wherein God may ſpeak of himſelf after the manner of men) what <hi>the covering of Judah</hi> was; that is, what it was wherein they truſted, and wherewith they hoped to cover themſelves from this ſtorm that was coming upon them, namely, their own ſtrength, and the outward means they would with all diligence uſe to oppoſe their enemies: And this indeed we ſee is largely ſet forth in this and the following verſes. But now if we underſtand theſe words as ſpoken of the enemy, that <hi>he diſcovered the covering of Judah;</hi> then the meaning muſt needs be, that he had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their covering from them, to wit, by ſurprizing and beating down, either their ſtrong holds, in the borders of their land; or the walls and gates, the rampirs and other outwarks, with which they ſought to cover and ſhelter the City <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And then for the next clauſe, <hi>And thou didſt look in that day to the armour of the houſe of the foreſt,</hi> the drift of that I conceive is clear, to wit, that when the enemy was marching againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their eye was preſently upon the Armory and Magizine which they had in that City; inſtead of looking to the Lord, they looked to that as their main help and refuge. And that this was <hi>the houſe of the foreſt,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> built, is moſt probable, ſee the Note 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7.2. yet ſee the Note alſo <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.4. And however we muſt ſtill remember, that it is not the uſing of outward means for their defence, that is here condemned; but their relying principally upon this, with neglect of God. But the great queſtion ſtill is, What <hi>that day</hi> was, which the Prophet here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>And thou didſt look in that day to the armour of the houſe of the foreſt?</hi> To which I anſwer, that moſt Expoſitors hold, that both here and all along in the following verſes, the Prophet ſpeaks as of things done already; but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thereby how certainly they would thus do, when <hi>the day of trouble and treading down,</hi> threatned before, ver. 5. ſhould by their enemies be brought upon them. And thoſe that underſtand hereby that woful day, when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhould be taken and ſacked by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> do add further, that the Prophet doth purpoſely expreſs the buſie buffing they ſhould then make for the defence of their City, after the ſame way that was taken in the days of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to defend it againſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army; purpoſely to intimate, that though they would ſeem herein to imitate that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had done, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.2, 3, &amp;c. yet there would be in them nothing of that Faith and Piety, which was found in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he did ſo. But for the fuller reſolving of this Queſtion, ſee the Note before, ver. 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Ye have ſeen alſo the breaches of the City of</hi> David, <hi>that they are many,</hi> &amp;c.]
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42788:125"/>
That is, Hearing of your enemies marching againſt you, ye took a view of your walls, and ſo took notice of the many breaches therein, which had not been minded in times of Peace, that ye might repair them: yea, and that too in the walls of the inner City, (as fearing the enemy might break in thither) which becauſe it was long ſince taken by <hi>David</hi> from the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more peculiarly called the City of <hi>David,</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.7. And indeed of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> it is ſaid, that when he feared that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> would come and beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem, he built up all the wall that was broken,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.5. <hi>And that he gathered together the waters of the lower pool;</hi> to wit, both that the enemies Army might be diſtreſſed for want of water, and that they in the City might all the time of the Siege be furniſhed with water for all occaſions, ſee the Notes, Chap. 7.3. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.3, 4. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.16. But ſee the foregoing Note, ver. 8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And ye have numbred the houſes of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, the men, or the inhabitants of the houſes, to wit, that they might by an equal proportion appoint a ſet number of thoſe that were fit to bear Arms, for the ſeveral ſervices of the Siege, for watching and warding, and for being upon the Guards, and ſuch like: Or that they might know what quantity of bread and other proviſions would be requiſite againſt the Siege, in caſe they ſhould be brought to give out allowances to the ſeveral Families therein. But rather it is meant of the houſes themſelves, that they took a ſtrict account of the houſes in the Suburbs, upon and about the walls, that there might be none left ſtanding that might be advantageous to the Enemy to ſhelter themſelves in, nor any way out of which the Inhabitants might have any ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, or that might be any way a hinderance to their repairing of the Walls, or to the defence of the City; which the following words ſeem to imply, <hi>And the houſes have ye broken down to fortifie the wall;</hi> That is, ſuch houſes as were not fit to ſtand, ye pulled down, that there might be room for ſuch companies of Soldiers, as were to be in a readineſs for the defence of the walls; and that with the Stone and Timber of thoſe they pulled down, the City-walls might be repaired.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Ye made alſo a ditch between the two walls, for the water of the old pool,</hi> &amp;c.] We read of two walls which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.4. and which were fortified by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for the better defence of that City againſt <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.5. Now between theſe two walls it is ſaid they made <hi>a ditch,</hi> or a pond, as a receptacle <hi>for the water of the old pool,</hi> called elſewhere <hi>the upper pool,</hi> ſee the Note, Chap. 7.3. as likewiſe the foregoing Notes, ver. 8, 9. <hi>But ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had reſpect unto him that faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it long ago;</hi> That is, whilſt ye were thus eagerly intent upon the uſing of all outward means for the ſecuring of your City, ye never minded nor looked after God, who had long ago made it an holy City, an habitation for himſelf to dwell in, and who had by his Providence raiſed it to that glorious condition, wherein then it ſtood; ye took no care by calling upon him, and by turning from your evil ways, to engage him to protect and defend your City, who being <hi>the Maker thereof,</hi> would certainly have preſerved the work of his own hands, if ye had ſought to him in a right manner. See the Note,

2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.25. Some, I know, by <hi>the Maker thereof,</hi> &amp;c. underſtand the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Pools and Water-works before-mentioned, which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them: And others underſtand it of the Lord, as the Author of thoſe judgments, which according to what he had determined long ago, were now to come upon them. But the former Expoſition I conceive is the beſt. Only, if we refer this to the times when they made ſuch preparations to defend <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, it muſt be underſtood of the generality of the Princes and people, who might be regardleſs enough of God, and rely wholly upon outward defences, though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and other the faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, did chiefly look to God, as their only ſure refuge. And yet even of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himſelf it might be truly ſaid, that his Faith was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhaken, when by his Ambaſſadors he begged peace of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> upon ſuch baſe terms, and pillaged the Houſe of God, that he might pacifie him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.14, 16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Notes, ver. 1. and ver. 8, 9. <hi>did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping and to mourning;</hi> to wit, by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who gave them warning of the Judgments that were coming upon them, and invited them to Repentance, for the prevention of thoſe evils; and likewiſe by the Judgments themſelves which God had brought upon them, and upon their Brethren of the ten Tribes. And becauſe the Jews were wont by publick Proclamation to invite the People to Faſting and Mourning, as it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, that he proclaimed a Faſt throughout all Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.3. it may well be that there is an Alluſion thereto in this expreſſion of the Lord's calling them to weeping and to mourning. As for the following words, <hi>And to baldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloth,</hi> we muſt know, 1. That by <hi>baldneſs</hi> is <hi>Hyperbolically</hi> meant bitter and paſſionate mourning, as when men did in that caſe ſhave their heads, ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 1.20. or tear off the hair of their heads and beards, as it is ſaid <hi>Ezra</hi> did, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.3. which though it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden God's people in their mourning for the dead, ſee the Note, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.27. yet in caſe of publick Calamities and Repentance, ſo that it proceeded not from Deſpair and Impatience of Spirit, but from a vehement indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and contrition for ſin, it ſeems to be approved and commanded, Mic. 1.16. <hi>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldneſs as the eagle, for they are gone into captivity from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And behold, joy and gladneſs, ſtaying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating fleſh, and drinking wine,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, inſtead of faſting and mourning, they give up themſelves wholly to jollity and feaſting; <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die:</hi> as if they had ſaid, The life of man is ſhort, and is many times gone on a ſudden; we may perhaps die to morrow; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be merry, and take comfort in what we have whilſt we may: Or, rather thus, The Prophet tells us, that we have not long to live; an enemy will ſuddenly break in upon us, that will deſtroy us all; let us therefore be jovial whilſt we may; and while we are yet alive, let us make a merry day of it. Thus they ſcoffed at the threatnings of Gods Prophets. And becauſe the not believing of that which God hath revealed to us concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, doth work in men the ſame prophane ſecurity, the Apoſtle applieth theſe words to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of hoſts, Go, get thee unto this Treaſurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the houſe.]</hi> This is a Prophecy againſt a particular perſon, delivered, as it ſeems, at the ſame time with that which went before, concerning the ſtate of <hi>Judea</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in general. And becauſe amongſt the Nobles that were ſent out by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to treat with <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Captains, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.18. we find one <hi>Shebna</hi> mentioned, and likewiſe <hi>Eliakim</hi> the Son of <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> (of one the Prophet ſpeaks afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) therefore moſt Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors do hold, that theſe were that <hi>Shebna</hi> and <hi>Eliakim,</hi> that were <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> great Officers, and that accordingly the foregoing Prophecy (ſome part of it, at leaſt, if not all) muſt be underſtood of the havock made in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the ſtraits whereunto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was brought by <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they that underſtand the foregoing Prophecy of the taking and ſacking <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> have nothing to anſwer to this Objection, but that, either 1. to gain the greater credit to that which the Prophet had foretold, that was ſo long after to come to paſs, here he foretels that which within a few years after ſhould be accompliſhed; Or elſe, 2ly. That this <hi>Shebna</hi> and <hi>Eliakim,</hi> of whom the Prophet here ſpeaks, were two other of the ſame name, that lived in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a little before the time of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> invading <hi>Judea,</hi> which is altogether improbable. But if the Prophet ſpeaks here, may ſome ſay, of a <hi>Shebna</hi> and <hi>Eliakim,</hi> that were in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Court, why is it ſaid here, that <hi>Shebna</hi> was <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and <hi>over the houſe,</hi> that is, Comptroller, or Lord High Steward of the King, houſe; whereas in that, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.18. it is ſaid, That <hi>Eliakim the Son of Hilkiah was over the houſhold,</hi> and <hi>Shebna</hi> is only called <hi>the Scribe</hi> or <hi>Secretary?</hi> To which may be anſwered, either that this <hi>Shebna,</hi> againſt whom the Prophet here prophecieth, was not the ſame <hi>Shebna</hi> that is mentioned 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.18. (as is there noted) Or elſe rather, that though <hi>Shebna</hi> was <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and <hi>over the houſe,</hi> when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was appointed to denounce the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Judgment againſt him, yet before that time that <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he had been by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> upon ſome fair pretence, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the place of being <hi>over the houſe,</hi> and put into a place of leſs Dignity; to wit, that of being the <hi>Scribe</hi> or <hi>Secretary,</hi> and <hi>Eliakim</hi> advanced to that place of being Lord Steward of the Kings houſe; and that this was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Shebna</hi>'s fall. However evident it is, that he was a rotten-hearted man, altogether unworthy of that great place he held, advanced perhaps thereto by <hi>Ahaz;</hi> and not therefore at firſt to be removed by <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> for that which is mentioned in the following verſe of his proud providing ſuch a ſtately Sepulcher for himſelf after he was dead, ſhewed him to be one of thoſe that minded not the threatnings of Gods Prophets, but went on in his ways
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42788:127"/>
ſecurely, when the Land, the City and the whole people, were like to be brought into a very ſad Condition. And therefore I conceive theſe words, <hi>Go, get thee unto this Treaſurer,</hi> were ſpoken in a way of contempt and indignation; as if the Lord had ſaid, Go, get thee to this wicked wretch, this Treaſurer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>What haſt thou here,</hi> &amp;c?] That is, as ſome would have it, What haſt thou to do here? This place of Honour is no way fit for ſuch a one as thou art. Or, <hi>What haſt thou here? and whom haſt thou here?</hi> That is, What poſſeſſion of Inheritance, or what Kindred, or Allies, haſt thou here in the Land of <hi>Iſrael, that thou haſt hewed thee out a Sepulcher here;</hi> to wit, in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or in the Land of <hi>Judea, as he that heweth him out a Sepulcher on high;</hi> that is, a lofty Sepulcher, or a Sepulcher in ſome conſpicuous and eminent place; <hi>and that graveth an habitation for himſelf in a rock?</hi> that is, That buildeth himſelf ſome ſtrong and ſtately Palace that ſhall abide for many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, as being built upon a rock; or, that heweth him out a gallant Tomb <hi>in a rock,</hi> the houſe or habitation wherein he muſt dwell when he is dead, that it may remain as a Monument of his Greatneſs amongſt his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for many Ages. He was, it ſeems a Foreigner, at leaſt a man of mean and obſcure parentage, come up of nothing; (which may ſeem the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe in that, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.18. where the three Princes are named, whom <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſent out to parley with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captains; the other two have their parentage mentioned, but of <hi>Shebna</hi> it is only ſaid, that he was <hi>the Scribe</hi>) and ſo by this ſharp expoſtulation, he is taxed, 1. for his exceeding pride and arrogancy, not in that he provided a Sepulcher for his dead body before-hand, See <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.60. but in that being ſuch a one as he was, he ſhould provide ſuch a Magnificent and Princely Monument for his dead Corps; as if he had been of great birth and ancient deſcent. And 2ly. for his fond and preſumptuous confidence, that he ſhould certainly live and die in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas it ſhould be nothing ſo; God having determined, that he ſhould be depoſed from his place of Honour, and be carried into a far Country, where he ſhould die, and be laid up in the earth, far enough from that glorious Tomb which he had erected for himſelf, as is more largely ſet forth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Behold, the Lord will carry thee away,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have this rendred, as it is in the Margin, <hi>Behold, the Lord who covered thee with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent covering, and clothed thee gorgeouſly</hi> (which muſt be underſtood of the Robes he wore proper to that place of Honour whereunto God had advanced him) <hi>ſhall ſurely turn and toſs thee;</hi> as it followeth in the next verſe. But que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs the Tranſlation in our Bibles is the beſt, <hi>Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty Captivity.</hi> It is in the Hebrew, <hi>with the Captivity of a man,</hi> but thereby is meant <hi>a mighty Captivity;</hi> and that, ſay many Expoſitors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men-Captives are commonly uſed more hardly, and carried farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than thoſe of the weaker Sex are. It is, as if he had ſaid, Thou makeſt full account to live and die in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but God will certainly ſend thee pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a far Country, and there thou ſhalt end thy days: he will make thee famous in another manner, than that which thou affecteſt; and thou ſhalt not be buried in an ordinary way, but with contempt and diſgrace; <hi>and will ſurely
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42788:127"/>
cover thee;</hi> that is, he will even overwhelm thee with ſhame and confuſion. And herein there may be an Alluſion to the Cuſtom of Covering the faces of thoſe that were condemned to die. See the Note <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.8. And this, no doubt, with all that which followeth in this Prophecy, was in due time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; but how and when it came to paſs, the Scripture doth no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Some think that he went out ſecretly and perfidiouſly to <hi>Sennacherib</hi> upon a deſign of betraying <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to him; at which time the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army being miraculouſly deſtroyed, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> in a great rage carried him away with him. Others conceive that he was carried away by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> And others ſay, that he was baniſhed by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or that he went away of his own accord into Foreign parts, being diſplaced and caſt out of the Court, and there lived and died miſerably. But all theſe are but Conjectures.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>He will ſurely violently turn and toſs thee like a ball into a large Country,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as a ball being thrown with great ſtrength in a large plain, where there is nothing to ſtop it, will fly and run very far way; or may be toſſed up and down from one place to another, becauſe the place is very ſpacious every way; ſo the Lord will be ſure to ſend thee far away from the place of thy preſent abode, into the Territories of ſome great King, that hath large Dominions; and there thou ſhalt be driven up and down from place to place in an afflicted and reſtleſs Condition; <hi>there ſhalt thou die</hi> in a ſtrange land, not in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where thou haſt provided thy ſelf ſuch a ſtately Sepulcher; <hi>And there the Chariots of thy Glory ſhall be the ſhame of thy Lords houſe;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, Thy former Glory ſhall be turned into extream contempt, which ſhall redound much to the ſhame of thy Lord, whilſt it ſhall be ſaid of him in his poor and wretched eſtate, That once he lived as a Prince in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s Court; Or rather, thy rich and glorious Chariots wherein thou now rideſt up and down in great pomp and ſtate, ſhall then tend to the diſhonour of thy Lord, and of his houſe too, over which thou art ſet; in that it ſhall be ſpoken of to his diſgrace, that ſuch a vile wretch as he ſhould be ſo highly advanced, and live in ſo great Grandeur in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Court.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And I will drive thee from thy ſtation,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken in the perſon of God. Though thou thinkeſt thy ſelf firmly ſetled in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I, ſaith the Lord, will drive thee from thence, <hi>and from thy state;</hi> that is, thy Office, and place of Dignity, <hi>ſhall he pull thee down,</hi> that is the King; yet it may well be, as many others think, that even this alſo is meant of God, the Prophets ſpeaking here of God in the the third perſon.

See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5. and <hi>Job</hi> 12.18, 21. he ſhall be advanced to the place of Honour, which now thou enjoyeſt; for ſo this Expreſſion is explained in the following words, <hi>and I will commit thy Government into his hand.</hi> All which was now made known to <hi>Shebna,</hi> the more deeply to wound his heart; for though it muſt needs be ſad tidings to ſuch an ambitious wretch, to hear of his being depoſed from ſo high a dignity, yet it is like enough, that it added to his vexation, to be told of the man that ſhould be honoured with his place. And it may well be too, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> might haſten both the downfall of the one, and the advancement of the other, <hi>and he ſhall be a Father to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and to the houſe of Judah;</hi> That is, he ſhall with much Fatherly Affection and Care govern the people of the land, to wit, as a prime Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor under the King, and they ſhall love and honour him as a Father.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the houſe of David</hi> is meant the King's Court or Houſhold, ſee the Note, Chap. 7.2. And it was commonly ſo called, becauſe God had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the Soveraignty and Kingly Power in that Nation ſhould be ſetled in the Family of <hi>David;</hi> and accordingly, by laying <hi>the key of the houſe of David</hi> upon the ſhoulder of <hi>Eliakim</hi> is meant, that he ſhould be made Lord High-Steward, or Comptroller of the King's Court, and ſhould have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, under the King, of ordering and diſpoſing all things in his houſe, and in governing his Family. Becauſe he that hath the juſt command of the keys in a houſe, hath power to diſpoſe of all things therein at his pleaſure, and no man can come into the houſe, or go out, but by his leave, (whence it is that the poſſeſſion of houſes and the ſupreme command over Towns and Cities, is uſually given unto men, by the delivering up the keys to them;) therefore even in theſe times, they that have chief Charge and Government in the Courts and Houſes of Kings, have uſually a Golden Key, as the ſign and badg of their Office. And ſome think that it was ſo with <hi>Eliakim,</hi> at leaſt that he wore the figure of a key made with embroidered work upon his cloak, and that thence it is ſaid, that the Key of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be laid <hi>upon his ſhoulder:</hi> But theſe are mere conjectures. The true reaſon why it is ſaid, that this Key of Government ſhould be laid <hi>upon his ſhoulder,</hi> was to ſignifie the great weightineſs and burden of that charge, which was hereby impoſed upon him; ſee the Notes, Chap. 9.6. And to hint, it may be, the abilities wherewith God had furniſhed him for ſo great a ſervice, that God had given him ſhoulders fit to bear ſuch a burden. <hi>So he ſhall open, and none ſhall ſhut; and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open;</hi> that is, he ſhall have abſolute Power for the governing of the Royal Family, and for the ordering of all things therein: Nothing ſhall be done without him, nor ſhall any man have power to croſs or hinder him, in what he will have done. And herein was <hi>Eliakim</hi> a type of Chriſt; whence it is that St. <hi>John,</hi> clearly in reference to this place, doth ſet forth the Supreme Power of Chriſt in and over the Church in theſe very terms, Rev. 3.7. <hi>He that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And I will faſten him as a nail in a ſure place,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, As a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42788:128"/>
nail, which men uſe to faſten ſurely in ſome wall or poſt, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hang their houſhold Utenſils; ſee the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.8. The meaning is, that God would ſo ſettle him in that Office, whereto he was to be advanced, that he ſhould never be removed from thence, as <hi>Shebna</hi> ſhould be: As he would make him conſtanly iuſt and faithful in his place, that he ſhould no way deſerve to be removed, ſo he would alſo ſecure him from being injuriouſly or cauſeleſly thruſt out: <hi>And he ſhall be for a glorious Throne to his Fathers houſe;</hi> That is, he ſhall be an exceeding great honour to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which he is, ſay ſome; or rather to all his Kindred and Family, and by his means they ſhall live in very great ſplendor and glory, as great in a manner, as if they were of the Blood Royal. And this is oppoſed to that which was before ſaid of <hi>Shebna,</hi> ver. 18. that he ſhould be the ſhame of his Lords houſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers houſe, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring and the iſſue,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, All his Kindred and Allies, even they and their Poſterity, together with all the Honour and places of Dignity they enjoy, ſhall wholly depend upon <hi>Eliakim,</hi> that <hi>nail in a ſure place,</hi> (as he was called in the foregoing verſe) and they ſhall willingly acknowledg that all their glory was derived to them from him. And then the more fully yet to expreſs how they ſhould all, even to the meaneſt of them, receive ſome benefit by his greatneſs in the Kings Court, following ſtill the ſame metaphor, he adds, <hi>all veſſels of ſmall quantity: from the veſſels of Cups, even to all the veſſels of flagons;</hi> (or, as it is in the margin) <hi>inſtruments of viols,</hi> that is, both Cups and Pots of ſeveral weights and ſizes; and likewiſe all kind of muſical inſtruments. And the meaning is, that not only the greater ones in his Family, that were of moſt note, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for honourable Imployments, ſhould be preferred and upheld by him; but that all of what rank and condition ſoever they were, even to the very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of their Families, ſhould receive ſome advantage, either in ſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſigned, or ſome reſpect given to them, by reaſon of their Relation to him, and dependance upon him. Thoſe I know, that by <hi>his Fathers houſe,</hi> do underſtand more generally the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> do accordingly expound theſe words in a larger extent; to wit, That all the people, rich and poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould depend upon <hi>Eliakim,</hi> and willingly ſubmit to him; and that he ſhould uphold and defend, not the Nobles and Rich, and Great Ones only, but even the pooreſt and meaneſt amongſt them, and all that belonged to them; and that the benefit that ſhould redound to the people by his wiſe ordering the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realm, ſhould continue from one Generation to another; <hi>the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring and the iſſue.</hi> Again others would have the meaning to be, That all the Officers at Court, even to the meaneſt of them, ſhould depend upon him, and be at his diſpoſing, and be under his power and government. But the former Expoſition is clearly the moſt genuine.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord of Hosts, ſhall the nail that is faſtned in the ſure place, be removed, and be cut down, and fall,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Shebna,</hi> that ſeems now to all men to be ſo ſurely ſetled in his place, that there is no likelihood of removing him, even as a nail is nailed and faſtened in a ſure place, and is himſelf moſt confident of it, as appears by the ſtately Sepulchre he hath in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> built for his dead body, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. even he ſhall be thruſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42788:129"/>
out of his Office, that <hi>Eliakim</hi> may ſucceed in his place; <hi>and the burden that was upon it ſhall be cut off,</hi> that is, All that had their dependance upon him, ſhall ſink with him; and all the hopes of his wicked faction, that reſted and relied on him, ſhall together with him fall to the ground.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THE Burden of Tyre,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Tyre</hi> was a City in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> lying upon the midland Sea, yea, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner encompaſſed with the Sea, as <hi>Venice</hi> is; and ſo was a Port and Mart-Town of greateſt note in thoſe times, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.3, 4. <hi>Say unto Tyrus, O thou that art ſituate at the entry of the Sea, which art a Merchant for the people of many Iſles—Thy borders are in the midſt of the Seas.</hi> See alſo the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12. when <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> this City fell to the lot of <hi>Aſhur, Joſh.</hi> 19.29. and that it was not far from <hi>Galilee,</hi> is evident, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.21. That <hi>Jeſus went thence into the Coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</hi> But it ſeems, being a place of exceeding great ſtrength, (and therefore called in that, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.29. <hi>the strong City Tyre.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.7. <hi>The strong hold of Tyre</hi>) The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were afraid to attempt it, and ſo it continued ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. But now what the Judgment was, wherewith this great City <hi>Tyre</hi> is here threatned in this burdenſom Prophecy, is very queſtionable. Some hold it is meant of the great ſtreights whereinto this City was brought within a ſhort time after, by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> and <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> which ſeems not to me ſo probable, at leaſt that this was not all that was here intended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prophet ſpeaks here expreſly of this City's being <hi>laid waſte;</hi> whereas the utmoſt that any Hiſtory reports concerning the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> attempts againſt <hi>Tyre</hi> is, That they blocked it up for five years: and ſome add too, That the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were at laſt overcome in a Sea-fight, wherewith the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly puffed up. Again others under the calamity wherewith <hi>Tyrus</hi> is here threatned, do comprehend the taking, ſacking and deſtroying of <hi>Tyre</hi> by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great; of whom indeed it is reported by ſeveral Hiſtorians, that after a long and hard ſiege, he at length filled up that branch of the Sea, that was betwixt the continent and <hi>Tyre,</hi> that ſo his Army might approach her walls, and by this means took it and utterly ruined it. But it is not, I conceive, very probable that this is intended neither; and that becauſe <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of this Chapter there followeth a promiſe, That ſeventy years after the ruine here threatned, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſhould recover their liberty again, which we do not find was ever done after <hi>Alexander</hi> had deſtroyed it. And therefore in the laſt place, the moſt of Expoſitors do underſtand it of the deſolation that was brought upon this City by <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> which indeed ſeems moſt probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Becauſe in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42788:129"/>
againſt <hi>Tyre,</hi> which agreeth in many paſſages with this, it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of the <hi>Syrians</hi> Captivity do ſute ſo well with the ſeventy years of the <hi>Jews</hi> Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And obſervable it is, that elſewhere two ſins are particularly mentioned, as the principal cauſe of the ruine that God here threatens to bring upon this City, to wit, her exceſſive Pride in her riches and great ſtrength. And 2ly. her inſulting over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when ſhe was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſame King, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.2. and 28.2. and <hi>Joel</hi> 3.4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howl ye ſhips of Tarſhiſh,</hi> &amp;c.] Figuratively this may be ſpoken to the ſhips themſelves; but rather it is meant of thoſe in the ſhips, <hi>Howl ye ſhips of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh,</hi> that is, mourn and lament bitterly, O ye Seamen and Merchants, that are ſtill paſſing in your ſhips, by way of trading between <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and other foreign parts; and indeed <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> is expreſly mentioned amongſt thoſe that traded with <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 27.12. but for the <hi>ſhips of Tarſhiſh,</hi> ſee the Notes 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.22. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.7. <hi>for it is laid waſte;</hi> to wit, <hi>Tyre</hi> and the Iſland wherein it ſtood; and therefore all the Merchandiſe you left therein is utterly loſt, and the rich trading you had wont to have with that famous City, is now at an end; <hi>ſo that there is no houſe, no entring in,</hi> that is, No houſe to entertain you; no going in, or coming out by way of trading; <hi>from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them,</hi> that is, They of the land of <hi>Chittim,</hi> who being nearer to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> did firſt hear of it, revealed it to thoſe of <hi>Tarſhiſh.</hi> And who are meant by thoſe of <hi>the land of Chittim,</hi> See <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.24. Other Expoſitions I know are given of that laſt clauſe; but according to our Tranſlation, that which I have given, ſeems the cleareſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Be ſtill ye inhabitants of the Iſle,</hi> &amp;c.] Some hold, that <hi>Iſle</hi> is here collectively put for Iſlands, and accordingly that it is the inhabitants of the <hi>Iſlands</hi> of the Midland-Sea that are here adviſed to <hi>be ſtill,</hi> that is, to reſt quietly in their ſeveral places, and not to think of making any more voyages to <hi>Tyre,</hi> that was utterly deſtroyed, or to ſit down ſilent mourning with her, and for her. But they are rather the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that are here ſpoken to, which was an Iſle, till <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (as Hiſtories report) joyned it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, ſee the foregoing Notes. <hi>Be ſtill ye inhabitants of the Iſle,</hi> that is, Boaſt not ſo proudly, O ye <hi>Tyrians,</hi> as you had wont to do in your great riches, and the invincible ſtrength of your City, make not your City to ring with your revelling and rioting, as you have uſed to do; but rather let the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, horror, and grief that is befallen you, ſtop your mouths, and make you ſit down in ſilence, as mourners uſe to do, See the Note <hi>Job</hi> 2.13.

though they had indeed ſeveral Kings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.2.) the <hi>Zidonian</hi> Merchants were ſtill in greateſt number there. The drift of theſe laſt words is to imply, that notwithſtanding her great ſtate and riches, ſhe ſhould be laid waſte and deſolate. But obſervable withal it is, that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Tyrus</hi> is brought in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when ſhe was deſtroyed; with theſe very words, <hi>I ſhall be repleniſhed now ſhe is laid waſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And by great waters the ſeed of Sihor, the harvest of the river is her revenue,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Sihor</hi> is uſually taken to be a ſmall river that divided <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Palestina, Numb.</hi> 34.5. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13.3. And accordingly ſome hold, that by <hi>the ſeed of Sihor</hi> here, is meant the ſeed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is here called <hi>Sihor;</hi> becauſe this river <hi>Sihor</hi> was its utmoſt bounds. But now becauſe it ſeems no way probable, that <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Sihor,</hi> only becauſe of a ſmall brook of that name, that went through the skirts of that Country, and for ſeveral other reaſons that they give for it; many learned men do with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence affirm, that it is <hi>Nilus</hi> that is here called <hi>Sihor</hi> (it may be with reſpect to a ſmall branch of it that ran out to the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was there called <hi>Sihor</hi>) and that by <hi>the ſeed of Sihor</hi> here, is meant the ſeveral fruits, which the ſeed ſown in <hi>Egypt</hi> by the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> yieldeth to them; as all kind of Corn, Flax, and ſuch like. And ſo the meaning of the words ſeems to be plainly this, That the Wheat and other grain and fruit that either grew abundantly in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> by <hi>the great waters</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the water-courſes that were drawn from thence (called therefore <hi>the harvest of the river</hi>) Or, that were tranſported by <hi>the great waters</hi> of the Ocean-Sea, was the Revenue of <hi>Tyre,</hi> wherewith her own Inhabitants were maintained, and wherewith ſhe traded into other Countries. Though ſhe had no grounds (comparatively) of her own, yet <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> afforded her yearly a plentiful Crop and Harveſt; <hi>and ſhe is a mart of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that is, That great Mart-Town, whither all Nations, in a manner, far and near, do daily reſort for trading; as is largly ſet forth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. All which is here inſerted to imply, That notwithſtanding ſhe was ſo rich, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied with all kind of Proviſion, yet this ſhould not ſave her from ruine.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Be thou aſhamed, O Zidon,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, either 1. becauſe, as ſome ſay, <hi>Zidon,</hi> who was the mother of <hi>Tyre,</hi> had not defended that her daughter, but was forced to ſit ſtill and look on, whilſt ſhe was laid waſte by her enemies. And indeed we find in ſome Hiſtorians, that the <hi>Zidonians</hi> being vanquiſhed by the King of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> did tranſport themſelves by ſhipping to the Iſland of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and there ſeated themſelves, and built that City. Or, 2ly. becauſe the ſame Deſolation and Deſtruction that was fallen upon <hi>Tyre,</hi> was fallen upon them; the enemy was not like to ſpare ſuch a conſiderable neighbour City and Port-Town; nor were they likely to ſtand out againſt an enemy, that had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the ſtronger City of <hi>Tyre;</hi> and the ſame wickedneſs that had provoked God againſt <hi>Tyre,</hi> was alſo rife amongſt them. And 3ly. becauſe <hi>Zidon</hi> that had gloried ſo much in <hi>Tyre,</hi> as a Colony that of old had iſſued forth from her, and that had reſted ſo much upon her aid and defence, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her ſelf ſuch great matters by her trading with her, was now bereaved of all Glory, and diſappointed of all her hopes by that utter ruine that was come
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42788:130"/>
upon <hi>Tyre.</hi> And that this was intended, appears by the reaſon ſubjoyned, <hi>for the Sea hath ſpoken,</hi> that is, <hi>Tyre</hi> that lay <hi>in the midst of the Sea,</hi> Ezek. 28.2. and as a Queen had the rule and command of the Sea, <hi>even the ſtrength of the Sea,</hi> that is, the ſtrongeſt of all Sea-Towns, as being built on a rock, and environed with the Sea, <hi>ſaying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I nouriſh up young men, nor bring up Virgins:</hi> that is, I am as if I had never brought forth Sons and Daughters, being left deſolate and waſte, and all my Inhabitants being cut off and deſtroyed, or carried away captives; I am never like to ſend forth great Colonies into other Countrys, as I have formerly done: Or, it is all one with me, as if I had never brought forth Sons and Daughters, there being none of them that have appeared in my defence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>As at the report concerning Egypt, ſo ſhall they be ſhortly pained at the report of Tyre.]</hi> That is, As the neighbour Nations were of old ſorely troubled and affrighted at the report of Gods deſtroying <hi>Egypt</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time (for which ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16.) ſo ſhall all the great Cities and Kingdoms near to <hi>Tyre,</hi> be perplexed and terrified when they hear of the Deſtruction of <hi>Tyre.</hi> This is, I conceive the plain meaning of this place; yet ſome rather think, that the Prophet ſpeaks of a later Deſtruction of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and ſo would have the words to be underſtood thus, That the neighbour Cities and Countries ſhould be as much diſquieted and ſcared with the report of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> taking <hi>Tyre,</hi> as they would be afterward at the report of his ſubduing <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that becauſe thy eſteemed it ſuch an invincible place, that they would be ready to conclude, that having taken that, no other place could ſtand before him; but he would deal with them all, as he had done with <hi>Tyre.</hi> And indeed if it be <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s prevailing againſt <hi>Egypt</hi> that is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the words muſt be underſtood thus; for to be ſure <hi>Tyre</hi> was ſubdued by him before <hi>Egypt,</hi> as is evident, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18, 19, 20. where <hi>Egypt</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him as his wages for his great ſervice againſt <hi>Tyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Paſs ye over to Tarſhiſh,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be ſpoken to the ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that uſed to come to <hi>Tyrus</hi> for Traffick, to wit, That <hi>Tyrus</hi> being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhould now betake themſelves to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> or ſome other Mart-Town, to ſet up a way of trading there; or elſe to the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> themſelves, that as many of them as could, ſhould flee away to <hi>Tarſhiſh;</hi> and ſee the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. yea, why may not both of them be here intended? And as for the following clauſe, <hi>Howl ye inhabitants of the Iſle,</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Is this your joyous City, whoſe antiquity is of ancient days?</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Is all your jollity, and all your glorying in the Antiquity of your City come to this at laſt? Thus doth the Prophet upbraid the <hi>Tyrians</hi> for their Pride and vain confidence in the antiquity of their City, as if there could be no fear of any change, becauſe ſhe had continued ſo long in ſuch a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Condition. And indeed we find, that <hi>Tyre</hi> was of great Antiquity: In <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time it was called <hi>the strong City Tyre,</hi> Joſh. 19.29 But this was no ground of ſecurity, when God would contend with her; and therefore is that added, <hi>her own feet ſhall carry her afar off to ſojourn,</hi> that is, Her proud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants that had wont to paſs the Seas in their ſtately ſhips, and at other times
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42788:131"/>
to be carried up and down in great pomp from place to place, ſhall be glad to trot a foot, as poor ſlaves and beggars are wont to do, into ſome remote Country; which may be meant, either of thoſe that ſhould flee away from the enemy into Foreign parts, and there wander up and down in a forlorn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whitherſoever their feet would carry them; or of thoſe that ſhould be carried away Captives, either into <hi>Babylon,</hi> or ſome of her Provinces, and there be ſold and driven away, it may be, further off, not being long ſuffered to reſt in any place.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Who hath taken this counſel againſt Tyre,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, who is of that power and confidence, as to dare to undertake the ſubduing of ſuch a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, invincible City as <hi>Tyre</hi> ſeemed to be, and that hath continued ſo long in ſuch ſtrength and glory; as if the Prophet had ſaid, Who would ever have thought, that this would have been done to this mighty City? <hi>the crowning City,</hi> that is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, That by her wealth is grown up to be a Royal City, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.22. or that carrieth her ſelf as a Princeſs or Queen over all the Cities and Sea-ports round about her; or that hath enriched other Cities ſo, as to make them Royal Cities. But rather ſhe is called the crowning City, becauſe ſhe crowned her Merchants and Inhabitants, and thoſe likewiſe that traded with her, with exceeding wealth and magnificence, ſo that they lived more like Princes, than men of ordinary rank; for ſo the following words ſeem to explain this, <hi>whoſe Merchants are Princes, whoſe Traffickers are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the earth,</hi> that is, whoſe Merchants lived in as great ſtate, as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Princes elſewhere uſed to do; yet ſome I know, would have this alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded herein, that even the Princes and great honourable men of other Nations uſed to traffick with her.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath purpoſed it,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the anſwer returned to the foregoing queſtion, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and it is all one in effect, as if the Prophet had ſaid, Wonder not that this ſhould befall <hi>Tyre;</hi> it is the Lord of hoſts that hath undertaken it and done it, before whom no ſtrength of the Creature can ſtand. And withal he adds the reaſon why the Lord had done it, <hi>to ſtain the Pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the Honourable of the earth,</hi> that is, To puniſh and abaſe the Pride of all the great and honourable ones that do arrogantly exalt themſelves, by pulling them down as unworthy to be in ſuch a lofty eſtate, and laying their Glory in the duſt, by bringing them into a baſe and contemptible condition. And this is expreſſed in theſe general terms, <hi>to stain the Pride of all Glory, and to bring into contempt all the Honourable of the earth;</hi> not only to ſet forth, that all the proud ones in <hi>Tyre,</hi> and in other Countrys that were advanced by trading with her, ſhould be brought down by this Judgment of God; but alſo to imply, 1. That God did no more in the ruine of <hi>Tyre,</hi> than what he had determined to do to all the great ones of the World, that ſhould proudly exalt themſelves becauſe of their greatneſs. And 2ly. that by this Deſtruction of <hi>Tyre,</hi> it would clearly be diſcovered what poor and contemptible things all the great ones of the World are, when the great God of Heaven comes to contend with them.</p>

                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:42788:131"/>Ver. 10 <hi>Paſs through the land as a river, O daughter of Tarſhiſh,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. By the Daughter of <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> I conceive is meant thoſe Mariners of Merchants of <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> or other foreign parts, that were in <hi>Tyre,</hi> upon the account of trading there; and that with reſpect to the Judgment and Ruine that was to come upon <hi>Tyre,</hi> theſe men are here adviſed to paſs through the land, where at preſent they had their abode, and to pack away home to their own Countrys; <hi>as a river,</hi> that is, Speedily and without any delay, even as the waters of a river, that falling down from higher grounds do paſs away with a ſwift Current, and run on without any intermiſſion, any ſtop or ſtay, till they come into the Sea. And ſome think too, That by this ſimilitude of their paſſing away <hi>as a river,</hi> there is implied alſo the throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and breaking away of theſe ſtrangers that were in <hi>Tyre,</hi> in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, like the huge heaps of waters that run crowding away in ſome great flood. They indeed that hold it is <hi>Tyre,</hi> that is here called the <hi>Daughter of Tarſhiſh</hi> (as conceiving that by <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> is meant the great Ocean Sea, and that <hi>Tyre</hi> is therefore ſo called, becauſe ſhe lay in the Sea, and had all her dealing in the Sea, and all her Store and Riches brought in by the Sea, as being the chief of all the Sea ports in thoſe parts) muſt needs accordingly hold, either that the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> are here adviſed to flee ſpeedily away <hi>as a river,</hi> ſomewhere elſe to ſeek a ſhelter for themſelves; or elſe that hereby it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told how they ſhould be violently hurried away out of their own land into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and ſo ſhould be ſcattered abroad like the waters of a river that overflow the banks. But the former Expoſition is far the cleareſt. As for the following clauſe, <hi>there is no more ſtrength,</hi> that is added as a reaſon why the Foreigners that were in <hi>Tyre,</hi> are called upon to pack away, and not to ſtay there, in hope that <hi>Tyre</hi> would be able to ſtand it out againſt her enemies; to wit, becauſe <hi>Tyre</hi> was certainly loſt, and would be no way able to defend her ſelf; becauſe in the Hebrew the words are, <hi>there is no more girdle:</hi> therefore ſome would have the meaning to be, That <hi>Tyre</hi> was ſo rifled and plundred of all her rich Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that there was not ſo much as a Girdle left in her, which was indeed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity wherewith the Merchants traded much in thoſe times; See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.24. But queſtionleſs the intent of the words are, that there was <hi>no more ſtrength</hi> left in <hi>Tyre,</hi> ſee the Note <hi>Job</hi> 12.21. only in the word <hi>Girdle</hi> there ſeems to be an Alluſion to her being bereft of all thoſe defences wherewith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhe had been begirt, her Walls, Bulwarks, Ditches and ſhipping; yea, the Sea it ſelf which did wholly encompaſs her, till the Enemy did by ſtrange devices, and incredible labour, joyn this Iſland to the Continent. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with that which is elſewhere ſaid of the taking and ſacking of <hi>Tyre,</hi> Ezek. 26.4. <hi>They ſhall deſtroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>He ſtretched out his hand over the Sea, he ſhock the Kingdoms,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And again in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words in this verſe, <hi>the Lord hath given a Commandment againſt this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-City.</hi> And indeed becauſe theſe laſt words, <hi>against the Merchant-City,</hi> are in the Hebrew, <hi>againſt Canaan,</hi> therefore ſome think that the Prophet in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words alſo ſpeaks here of the great things that God did at the Red Sea, and againſt the Kingdoms of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> when he carried <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42788:132"/>
                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> to plant them in that land which he had promiſed them; and that the reaſon why thoſe things are mentioned here, is only to ſhew, That the great God, who then did ſuch mighty things, would not find the ruining of <hi>Tyre</hi> a work too hard for him. But certainly the Prophet ſpeaks here ſtill expreſly of the Deſtruction of <hi>Tyre</hi> it ſelf; <hi>He ſtretched out his hand over the Sea,</hi> to wit, to ſmite and deſtroy <hi>Tyre</hi> that is encompaſſed with the Sea, ſee the Note <hi>ver.</hi> 4. or more generally the Iſlands and Provinces that lay on the Sea-coaſts; <hi>he ſhook the Kingdoms,</hi> that is, He ſhook and ſhattered the Kingdoms of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon,</hi> and others thereabout, by the enemies he brought upon them: Or he diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and terrified the neighbour-Kingdoms by the Deſtruction which he brought upon <hi>Tyre,</hi> partly through the grief that ſurprized them for the loſs of their gainful Trade with that City; and partly as being terrified, leſt the ſame ruine would come upon them, that was already come upon <hi>Tyre; The Lord hath given a Commandment againſt the Merchant-City:</hi> It is in the Original, <hi>againſt Canaan;</hi> but generally Expoſitors hold, that hereby is meant the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which they ſay, is here termed <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe it lay in the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as is evident, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.28, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where both <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon</hi> are reckoned amongſt the Cities of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.21, 22. where the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came <hi>out of the coaſts of Tyre and Zidon,</hi> is called <hi>a Woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> And indeed conſidering the word <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſometime uſed for a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant (as we find it tranſlated, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7. where it is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, He is a Merchant, the ballances of deceit are in his hand</hi>) and that <hi>Tyre</hi> was the chief Mart-Town for Merchandizing in thoſe parts: I conceive it is beſt rendred in our Bibles, <hi>The Lord hath given a Commandment againſt the Merchant-City.</hi> And the meaning however is, That God had given a Commiſſion to her Enemies the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> to pull her down; and therefore it was in vain to think, that her great ſtrength ſhould ſecure her; <hi>to deſtroy the ſtrong holds thereof,</hi> or, <hi>the ſtrengths thereof,</hi> as it is in the Margin, that is, whatever ſhe had, which ſhe might hope would be a means to defend her.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he ſaid, Thou ſhalt no more rejoyce, O thou oppreſſed Virgin Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zidon,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the Daughter of Zidon</hi> here, moſt Expoſitors hold, that <hi>Tyre</hi> is meant, and that ſhe is ſo called, becauſe ſhe was a Colony of <hi>Zidons;</hi> ſee above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. But according to the uſual Language of the Scripture, it is rather <hi>Zidon</hi> her ſelf, or the Inhabitants thereof, that is here called <hi>the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zidon; a Virgin-Daughter</hi> ſhe is termed, not only with reſpect to the beauty of the City, and the delicacy of the inhabitants, living at eaſe and pleaſure; but alſo eſpecially becauſe ſhe had never been hitherto ſubdued and brought under by any hoſtile power; but withal an <hi>oppreſſed Virgin,</hi> becauſe now even <hi>Zidon</hi> was to be deſtroyed as well as <hi>Tyre.</hi> And this I conceive is that which is intended by this Expreſſion, <hi>Thou ſhalt no more rejoyce, O thou op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Virgin Daughter of Zidon;</hi> not that <hi>Zidon</hi> ſhould never after this, be in a flouriſhing and rejoycing Condition (for it is moſt probable, that when <hi>Tyre</hi> was reſtored again, as is here afterward foretold, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Zidon</hi> alſo, together with <hi>Tyre,</hi> did alſo recover her former ſtate) nor that <hi>Zidon</hi> ſhould no more rejoyce in hope of her enriching and advancing her ſelf ſtill more by her trading with <hi>Tyre,</hi> becauſe <hi>Tyre</hi> was to be deſtroyed; but that ſhe ſhould
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42788:132"/>
not any longer triumph and be in ſuch jollity, as ſhe had hitherto been; and that becauſe together with <hi>Tyre</hi> even ſhe ſhould be alſo deſtroyed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to aſſure them of the certainty of this, he adviſeth the <hi>Zidonians</hi> to flee away, and to ſeek ſome place of ſhelter elſewhere, ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. or elſe foretels, that they alſo ſhould be carried away captives into Foreign parts; <hi>Ariſe, paſs over to Chittim,</hi> ſee the Notes before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>there alſo ſhalt thou have no reſt,</hi> to wit, becauſe even thence they ſhould be carried away as Slaves into remoter parts; Or, becauſe even thoſe parts alſo ſhould be invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the proud Conqueror.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans,</hi> &amp;c.] Expoſitors differ very much concerning the meaning of this verſe. That which ſeems moſt probable is, That to prevent any thought of the impoſſibility of <hi>Tyres</hi> being deſtroyed, becauſe it was a place of ſuch exceeding ſtrength, impregnable and invincible in the eye of reaſon, and becauſe it was a City of ſo great Antiquity, that had ſtood unſubdued, and flouriſhed proſperouſly for ſo many Ages, the Prophet doth here propound as conſiderable, that <hi>the Aſsyrian,</hi> a Nation far more ancient, and more potent than the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> was at laſt ſubdued and ruined by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> whom the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had raiſed to all their greatneſs; inferring from hence, that therefore it was no wonder at all, though the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> now joyned together, ſhould deſtroy <hi>Tyre.</hi> This I conceive is moſt probably the ſcope of this place; and accordingly I underſtand the words thus, <hi>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans,</hi> that is, Behold the people that now poſſeſs the land of <hi>Chaldea</hi> (that very people by whom God means now to deſtroy <hi>Tyre) this people was not,</hi> that is, They had not the name of a people, no body made any reckoning of them, <hi>till the Aſſyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> that is, Till the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> gathered them together that after the Flood, or after the Diſperſion occaſioned by the Diviſion of Tongues, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.11. were ſcattered abroad here and there, and lived in the wilderneſs in waſte and deſolate places, as a wild, rude people, not having any ſetled places of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, but dwelling in Tents, and ſetled them to live together as one aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated people <hi>in the land of Chaldea; they ſet up the towers thereof, they raiſed up the palaces thereof,</hi> that is, The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> brought them to live together in Townſhips and Commonalities, which by degrees came to be ſtately Cities, and places of great ſtrength; <hi>and he brought it to ruine;</hi> that is, God ruined the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> this ancient people that were the firſt Founders of that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Chaldea;</hi> or rather the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> that was at firſt brought to be a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and raiſed to ſuch a flouriſhing Condition by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> did at length by degrees ſubdue and ruine all the power of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and taking <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the chief ſeat of their Empire, did tranſlate the Empire from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to themſelves. Some I know do hold, That it is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Chaldean</hi> that is here inſtanced in, as the people, that being of greater ſtrength and antiquity than <hi>Tyre,</hi> was yet at laſt ſubdued by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> that had raiſed them to their greatneſs. And indeed we find that <hi>Babylon</hi> is mentioned 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.24. amongſt thoſe Kingdoms that had been ſubdued by the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> yea, and there are that take the laſt clauſe as ſpoken prophetically with reſpect to the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſubduing <hi>Chaldea; and he brought it to ruine;</hi> that is, God, by the <hi>Perſian</hi> will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42788:133"/>
bring it to ruine. And laſtly ſome ſay, that the drift of theſe words is to ſhew, that though <hi>Tyre</hi> did boaſt ſo much of her invincible ſtrength and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yet ſhe ſhould be ruined by a State more ancient and mighty than ſhe was, to wit, the <hi>Chaldeans; Behold, the land of the Chaldeans, this people was not;</hi> that is, This people had not any form of a State or Common wealth, <hi>till the Aſſyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderneſs;</hi> that is, till the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> founded it as a fit harbour for his ſhipping, and ſo brought in Colonies of people that had formerly dwelt in wild and waſte places; <hi>they ſet up the towers thereof, they raiſed up the palaces thereof;</hi> that is, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were they that brought <hi>Tyre</hi> to be ſuch a ſtrong and ſtately City; <hi>and he brought it to ruine;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, And thus <hi>Tyre</hi> is now like to be deſtroyed by them that at firſt founded her. But the firſt Expoſition ſeems to me the beſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Howl ye ſhips of Tarſhiſh,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>for your ſtrength is laid waſte;</hi> that is, <hi>Tyre,</hi> that was your ſtrong harbour for your ſhipping, and by trading with whom, you became ſo exceedingly enriched, and made powerful and mighty, is ruined and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, At that time, when this Prophecy againſt <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhall be accompliſhed, <hi>that Tyre ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſeventy years,</hi> that is, juſt for ſo many years ſhe ſhall lie in her ruines deſolate and forſaken, not minded nor regarded, either by God or man; ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1. Becauſe in the following verſe <hi>Tyre</hi> is compared to <hi>a harlot forgotten</hi> of her Lovers; it may well be that in Alluſion thereto it is here ſaid, That <hi>Tyre ſhall be forgotten,</hi> that is, That her Merchants ſhould no more come at her for traffick. But yet the Expreſſion may well be underſtood more generally, as including alſo Gods diſregarding of her, of whom it is therefore ſaid afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that he would <hi>viſit</hi> her, as it were remembring her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in mercy. As for the <hi>ſeventy years,</hi> the time here prefixed for <hi>Tyres</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſolate, I queſtion not, but that they muſt be counted from the time that <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould be taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> unto the ruine of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and conſequently that they are in a manner juſt the ſame with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of the <hi>Jews</hi> captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that becauſe we find the Prophets foretold, that at the ſame time when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſhould deſtroy <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhould alſo ſubdue the other neighbouring Nations round about, and particularly <hi>Tyre;</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.15.—22. and 27.2, 3. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.7. And it is moſt probable, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> were reſtored to their liberty, upon the breaking of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> yoke by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo it might be with other Nations too, that were under the ſame bondage. And this being ſo, obſervable it is, that <hi>Tyre,</hi> who was puniſhed for rejoycing at <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Deſtruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.2. lay juſt as many years deſolate as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did. As concerning thoſe words that are added, that for ſeventy years <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould be forgotten, <hi>according to the days of one King.</hi> Some would have the ground of this Expreſſion to be, That threeſcore and ten years are commonly accounted the time of a mans life that lives long; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. and conſequently alſo of the life of one King; and ſo they would have the words to be the ſame in effect, as if it had been ſaid, <hi>according to the days of one man.</hi> But becauſe there is little or no ſtrength in the Reaſons they give, why it is ſaid, <hi>according
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42788:133"/>
to the days of one King,</hi> and not of one man, I cannot approve of this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The true meaning of the words is, That <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould lie deſolate and forgotten ſeventy years, <hi>according to the days of one King;</hi> that is, of one Kingdom (ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17. by <hi>four Kings</hi> is meant four Kingdoms, or four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſucceſſions of Kings; and <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.21. by <hi>the King of Grecia</hi> is meant a Succeſſion of the ſeveral Kings of <hi>Greece</hi>) and ſo that which is intended, is, That <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould lye waſte ſo long as the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After the end of ſeventy years ſhall Tyre ſing as an harlot.]</hi> It is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>It ſhall be unto Tyre as the ſong of an harlot.</hi> But the meaning is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. That <hi>Tyre,</hi> being rebuilt and become a famous Mart again, ſhould be as jocund and jolly, as ever formerly ſhe had been, and as Harlots uſe to be when they are ſinging and ſporting themſelves amongſt their Lovers: Or, 2ly, That ſhe ſhould by all the art and skill ſhe could uſe, and by all the fair and pleaſing Invitations and Promiſes ſhe could make, ſeek to win the Nations far and near, to return to their old way of trading with her again, even as an Harlot that having been forſaken of her Companions, by reaſon of ſome foul Diſeaſe ſhe lay under, or ſome ſuch other occaſion, doth upon her recovery, by ſinging and all kind of flatteries and wantonneſs, labour to entice and allure her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to return to her again: Or, 3ly. the meaning may be only, That ſhe ſhould eagerly buckle her ſelf again to her old way of Traffick; wherein ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a ſinging Harlot, not only, as I conceive, to imply her eager intending her gain and profit, which is the only thing the Harlot minds; but alſo the fair and flattering Speeches, the Frauds and Deceits wherewith Traders are wont too often to put off their Wares, even as Harlots are wont to entice men to be dealing with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Take an harp, go about the City, thou harlot, that haſt been forgotten,</hi> &amp;c.] Perſiſting in the Metaphor began in the laſt words of the foregoing verſe, the Prophet ſpeaks here to <hi>Tyre,</hi> as to ſome forſaken Harlot, becauſe it was, it ſeems, uſual with ſuch Strumpets, thus to go playing and ſinging up and down the Cities, thereby to entice their former Cuſtomers to look after them again; <hi>Make ſweet melody, ſing many ſongs, that thou mayeſt be remembred;</hi> that is, That they may know thou art ſtill living, and where thou art to be had. But that which is intended hereby, is to foretel, that <hi>Tyre</hi> being raiſed again out of her Ruines, ſhould, like ſuch an Harlot, return again to her old Trade, and uſe all the Devices ſhe could, to bring in the Nations to traffick with her again, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, &amp;c. See the foregoing Note. And it may well be alſo, that the Prophet doth the rather uſe theſe Expreſſions, <hi>Take an harp, make ſweet melody,</hi> and in Alluſion to this City's being formerly much addicted to ſuch kind of Muſick; whence is that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> concerning <hi>Tyre,</hi> Chap. 26.13. <hi>I will cauſe the noiſe of thy ſongs to ceaſe, and the ſound of thy harps ſhall be no more heard.</hi> See alſo Chap. 28.13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs after the end of ſeventy years,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>that the Lord will viſit Tyre,</hi> to wit, in mercy, raiſing her up to a proſperous eſtate again, <hi>and ſhe ſhall turn to her hire;</hi> that is, She ſhall return to her old gainful Trade of Merchandizing, <hi>and ſhall commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42788:134"/>
with all the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> &amp;c. that is, as a Strumpet entertains all comers, ſo ſhall ſhe have Commerce with all Nations throughout the World, and ſhall as greedily purſue her old filthy Gain by unjuſt and fraudulent Courſes, as ever ſhe did.</p>
               <p>Ver 18. <hi>And her Merchandiſe and her hire ſhall be Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] This is by the conſent of almoſt all Expoſitors, ſpoken of the times when the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould embrace the Chriſtian Faith, to wit, That in thoſe times they ſhould conſecrate their Merchandiſe, and the Gain they got thereby, to the ſervice of God. In thoſe words, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> there ſeems to be an Alluſion to that <hi>Motto</hi> that was engraven on the High Prieſts golden Frontlet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36. as there is alſo in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.20. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the Bells of the Horſes, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD;</hi> but the meaning is, That the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſhould then beſtow a great part of their Wealth for pious uſes, as might be moſt for Gods Glory, and for the good of his Church and people. And indeed we find in the firſt ſpreading of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found ſome at <hi>Tyre</hi> that had already embraced the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.3, 4. See alſo the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.4. <hi>It ſhall not be treaſured nor laid up,</hi> that is, they ſhall not covetouſly hoard up all they get, meerly for themſelves, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they have done; <hi>for her Merchandiſe ſhall be for them that dwell before the Lord,</hi> that is, They ſhall lay out very much of their Wealth for the relief and ſupport of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and others the poor members of Chriſt: for though the Prophet expreſſeth this according to the Language of the Old Teſtament, <hi>for them that dwell before the Lord,</hi> as if he had been ſpeaking of the Prieſts and Levites, that did continually wait upon the Lord in the Temple; yet his meaning is, That when the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were once come into the Church, though they ſhould not heap up Wealth by unjuſt ways as formerly, yet what they got in an honeſt way, they ſhould willingly expend it for the ſupport of the Lords ſpecial Servants, the Miniſters that attend upon him in his Houſe, and others of his Houſhold of Faith, who are indeed a holy Prieſthood to the Lord, and do continually endeavour to walk with him, and to approve themſelves to him in all their ways; yea, and this the Prophet ſaith they ſhould do ſo freely and bountifully, that both the one and the other ſhould be comfortably and ſufficiently ſupplied with Means and Maintenance both for Food and good Raiment; for that is intended in thoſe laſt words, <hi>to eat ſufficiently, and for durable clothing.</hi>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>BEhold, the Lord maketh the earth empty,</hi> &amp;c.] This following Prophecy ſome would have reſtrained to the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and the Deſolation which <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> was ſhortly to bring upon it; and others, to the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42788:134"/>
Land both of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with reſpect to the Deſtruction thereof, firſt by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> But that this Prophecy is more comprehenſive than ſo, is evident by thoſe Expreſions, v. 4. <hi>The World languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fadeth away;</hi> and verſe 21. <hi>The Lord ſhall puniſh—the Kings of the earth upon the earth.</hi> Nor yet can it be meant (as ſome others would have it) of Gods deſtroying the whole World at the day of Judgment, becauſe <hi>ver.</hi> 13. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet addeth a paſſage concerning a remnant that ſhould be delivered from this common Deſtruction. It is therefore far more probably field by the moſt of Expoſitors, that the Prophet having in the foregoing Chapters (from Chap. 13. hitherto) denounced many ſore Judgments againſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the neighbour Nations round about them ſeverally, as the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c. doth here now denounce Deſolation and Deſtruction againſt them all jointly together; <hi>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waſte,</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid, What ſhould I ſpeak any longer of the Deſtruction of particular Cities and Countries? The Lord hath purpoſed to bring Ruine and Devaſtation upon the whole earth in a manner. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that becauſe the Prophet in foretelling this to the <hi>Jews,</hi> did more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aim at the awakening of them, and the calling of them to Repentance; therefore in this general denuntiation, he inſerts many paſſages with reſpect to them particularly (who were included amongſt the reſt) as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 2, and 5. where there is mention of their Prieſts, and Laws, and Covenant. But yet queſtionleſs the Prophecy is intended concerning that havock that was to be made amongſt the Nations before ſeverally threatned; and it may be others alſo, even all that were ſeated in thoſe parts of the World, firſt by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and then by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and then after that by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> There is a Prophecy much like to this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waſte,</hi> that is, He will empty the earth of the Inhabitants thereof, and of all wherewith it is repleniſhed and adorned; and leave it quite deſolate, See the Note Chap. 3.26. It is as if he had ſaid, That the earth was even over-burthened with an innumerable company of wicked wretches; and therefore God would eaſe her of her burden, <hi>and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it upſide down;</hi> which is in the Hebrew, <hi>and perverteth the face thereof;</hi> that is, It ſhall be ſo ruinated, that it ſhall not have the face that formerly it had; <hi>and ſcattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof;</hi> that is, ſome fleeing, and ſome being carried away Captives, they ſhall be diſperſed abroad amongſt ſeveral Nations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And it ſhall be as with the people, ſo with the Prieſt; as with the ſervant, ſo with his maſter,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Judgments threatned ſhall fall upon all ſorts and Conditions; none ſhall be ſpared in regard of any preheminence they have above others.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The land ſhall be utterly emptied,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>The earth mourneth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Inhabitants of the earth; See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Or, the earth it ſelf, by reaſon of the ſad plight whereinto it is brought; See the Note Chap. 3.26. <hi>And fadeth away,</hi> to wit, as plants that wither away; See the Note Chap. 1.30. <hi>The World lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42788:135"/>
and fadeth away,</hi> that is, All the Nations round about <hi>Judea</hi> againſt whom the foregoing Prophecies were denounced, lye deſolate and forſaken; See the Note upon the like Expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.11. and ſee alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.8. <hi>The haughty people of the earth do languiſh,</hi> that is, The great and lofty ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, ſee the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11, 12. yet becauſe it is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>the heigth of the people doth languiſh;</hi> therefore ſome do underſtand hereby the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom God had advanced by ſpiritual priviledges above all other people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The earth alſo is defiled under the inhabitants thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by the Blood and Carcaſes of men ſlain; Or rather by the abominable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that were committed by the inhabitants, as it is ſaid of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> Levit. 18.25. that it was <hi>defiled</hi> by the horrid ſins that were committed therein by the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> In the Expoſition there ſeems to be an Alluſion to thoſe things that by the Law of God were to be looked upon as polluted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had touched any perſons or things legally unclean. By <hi>the earth,</hi> ſome underſtand the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> particularly, placing the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of the words in this, That this land had not been kept pure, as a land ſo peculiarly conſecrated to God ought to have been. But I ſee not why it may not ſtill be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as in the foregoing verſes, of the whole earth generally; yet indeed it is very clear, that though the Prophet doth here foretel Judgments that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all the Nations round about; yet all along he doth ſtill turn his ſpeech more eſpecially to the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom he directed his Prophecy. And ſo he ſeems to do in the words immediately following, <hi>becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Ordinance, broken the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> that is, They have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly run on in a way of doing whatever they liſted themſelves, without ever taking any care to obey the Commandments of God; for though ſome would extend this to the Heathens ſinning againſt the Laws of Nature, which God had written in their hearts; yet methinks this is clearly added with reference to Gods people in particular. And though ſome by <hi>the Laws</hi> would have the negative Precept within the bounds whereof they would not be kept; and by <hi>the Ordinance,</hi> the affirmative Commandments, which they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to obey; yet more commonly by <hi>the Laws,</hi> Expoſitors underſtand the moral Laws; and by <hi>the Ordinance,</hi> the Ceremonial Statutes, which they are ſaid to have <hi>changed,</hi> either becauſe they kept not to the rule therein preſcribed, but changed and altered things as they pleaſed themſelves. However by <hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant</hi> which they had <hi>broken,</hi> is certainly meant that Covenant of Grace, which God had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and was to have been by them inviolably obſerved for ever.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Therefore hath the curſe devoured the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Curſe and Wrath which God denounced againſt all that rebel againſt him, and which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had imprecated upon themſelves in caſe of diſobedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. ſhall utterly conſume both the Inhabitants of the earth, and all beſides that is thereon. Yet becauſe in the following verſes the Prophet ſpeaks of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which the barrenneſs of the earth ſhould bring upon them; therefore ſome Expoſitors do underſtand this of the particular curſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.16, 17, 18. <hi>and they that dwell therein are deſolate,</hi> that is, They are left in a deſolate Condition, ſtripped of all their former Comforts and Enjoyments; <hi>therefore the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42788:135"/>
inhabitants of the earth are burned,</hi> that is, Deſtroyed with fire and ſword by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Invaſions; or rather, conſumed and deſtroyed by the flaming fire of Gods wrath; See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.18. and 10.16. yet ſome underſtand it of their being burnt up with that heat and drought, which ſhould be the cauſe of the burning up of the fruits of the earth, whereof afterward the Prophet ſpeaks; <hi>and few men are left,</hi> the generality of the people being cut off by Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or carried away into Captivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The new wine mourneth,</hi> &amp;c.] This Expreſſion is uſed to imply, either 1. That they ſhould have a mournful Vintage, their Vineyard yielding them ſo little Wine; or, 2ly. That their Wine ſhould be waſtfully ſpilt or ſwilled down by the Enemy: And ſo the next, <hi>the time languiſheth,</hi> implies, either 1. That their Vines ſhould fade away, and yield little fruit; or, 2ly. That they ſhould be cut or trodden down by their enemies; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.8. <hi>All the merry-hearted do ſigh,</hi> that is, all that having abundance, lived plenſantly and merrily, or all that uſed to be jovial and merry with drinking Wine, inſtead of ſinging ſhall now ſigh and mourn. And in all this now the Prophet doth covertly tax their former intemperance and exceſſive jollity; as if he ſhould have ſaid, You that have ſpent your days in ſuch immoderate pleaſures and jollity, ſhall ſhortly find, that the caſe will be ſadly alter'd with you.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>They ſhall not drink wine with a ſong,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken feaſting and revelling ſhall ceaſe; <hi>ſtrong drink ſhall be bitter to them that drink it;</hi> that is, Though they ſhould have ſtrong drink, they ſhall take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it for very anguiſh and ſorrow of heart; their miſeries and Calamities will imbitter all their Comforts.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>The City of confuſion is broken down,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> particularly; becauſe, ſay they, the Prophet doth ſtill ſeek to apply the Judgments here denounced particularly to the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom he propheſied. But it may better be underſtood collectively of the ſeveral Cities in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, againſt which the Prophet doth here prophecy. And they may be called Cities <hi>of confuſion,</hi> either with reſpect to the baſe confuſion and diſorder that was in them, there being nothing therein well ordered, as it ought to be; or elſe with reſpect to that Confuſion and Deſolation that was coming upon them; <hi>the City of Confuſion is broken down,</hi> that is, Every City deſtined to Confuſion and Deſtruction, ſhall be broken down by the enemy; <hi>every houſe is ſhut up, that no man may come in;</hi> that is, All houſes are ſo blocked up with the ruines of them, that there is no way to enter into them; or, they all lye deſolate, the Inhabitants being ſlain or carried away Captives, ſo that there is no coming out, or going into them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>There is a crying for wine in the ſtreets,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, of people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the want of it, or the loſs or ſpoiling of it by the Enemy; <hi>all joy is darkened,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Their joy ſhall be over-clouded with ſorrows, or turned into ſorrows; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>In the City is left Deſolation,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, not only in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but even in the Cities too, there ſhall be nothing left but Deſolation; all that is therein ſhall be deſtroyed: <hi>and the gate is ſmitten with Deſtruction,</hi> ſo that there is no going in, nor coming out there, but even in the gates, where there uſed to be the greateſt concourſe of people, there ſhall be utter Deſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:42788:136"/>Ver. 13. <hi>When thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the land among the people,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When there ſhall be ſuch Deſolation made, as is aforeſaid, among the people, both of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the neighbouring Nations round about them, <hi>there ſhall be as the ſhaking of an Olive-tree,</hi> &amp;c. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.22. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.6. where the ſame is ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that is here ſaid both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> together. The drift of theſe words is to ſhew, either 1. That the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made amongſt theſe people ſhould be ſo great, that there ſhould be but a very ſmall remnant left undeſtroyed. Or, 2ly. That though there ſhould be ſuch Deſolation made in thoſe parts of the earth, both <hi>Judea</hi> and the Countrys round about, yet there ſhould not be ſuch an utter riddance made of the people, but that there ſhould be a ſmall remnant left and reſerved, out of whoſe Poſterity God meant to gather a Church of his Elect, that ſhould praiſe his Name.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>They ſhall lift up their voice,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, This little remnant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, both in <hi>Judea</hi> and the Countrys round about, that ſhall eſcape that common Deſtruction and Deſolation that is coming upon the whole earth in a manner, in thoſe parts of the World, ſhall with great joy of heart lift up their voices to ſhout, and to praiſe God for their wonderful Deliverance; <hi>they ſhall ſing for the Majeſty of the Lord,</hi> that is, They ſhall with ſongs of Praiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol God, for the diſcovery that he hath made of his glorious Majeſty, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, and Juſtice, and Goodneſs, and Mercy, both in puniſhing thoſe multitudes that ſhall then be deſtroyed, and in preſerving that ſmall remnant of them that ſhall eſcape in that common Deſtruction; <hi>they ſhall cry aloud from the Sea,</hi> that is, From the Iſlands that are in the Sea; or from the Countrys beyond the Sea, even from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, the ſhouting and ſinging ſhall be heard of thoſe that with ſuch a loud voice ſhall praiſe the Lord for their deliverance. But now the great queſtion is, Of whoſe, and of what Rejoycing this is meant? Many learned Expoſitors there are, that do underſtand it meerly of thoſe that ſhould eſcape that general Deſtruction threatned in this Chapter, both in the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and all the Countrys about them. And ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hereby thoſe that were delivered from <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> or <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion in the days of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and others, far more probably, of thoſe that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped when the <hi>Babylonians</hi> made ſuch havock, both in <hi>Judea,</hi> and in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys round about, that were over-run and ſubdued by their victorious Armies. But becauſe the Prophet ſeems here to foretel, that the joy of the remnant that ſhould be reſerved, not only amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo amongſt the Heathens about them, ſhould be ſo exceeding great, and (in the following verſes, that they ſhould in their joy praiſe the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which the Heathens never did, till they embraced the Chriſtian Faith;) therefore I conceive he intends here, not only the joy and ſhouting, and ſinging of thoſe that ſhould be delivered from the general devaſtation (whoſe joy might be ſaid to be heard from the parts beyond the Sea, becauſe thither many of them might be ſold for Captives) but alſo principally the joy and ſinging of their Poſterity, that ſhould exceedingly triumph and praiſe God for the wonderful diſcovery of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Power and Mercy in the great work of mans Redemption by Chriſt, and in calling them into the Kingdom of Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpel; as likewiſe their lifting up their voice freely, and without fear, in ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42788:136"/>
the glad tidings of Salvation far and near, wherever they had any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do it. As for the laſt clauſe, <hi>they ſhall cry aloud from the Sea;</hi> ſome tranſlate that, <hi>they ſhall cry aloud from the Weſt;</hi> (becauſe the Mediterranean Sea lay on the Weſt of <hi>Judea</hi>) And accordingly they underſtand it, of the rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of thoſe believing <hi>Jews,</hi> that ſpreading the Goſpel in the Weſtern parts of the World (whither they fled upon the laſt Devaſtation of <hi>Judea</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi>) did exceedingly rejoyce, when they ſaw the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſubmit to the Scepter of Chriſt. But it is hard to ſay, that this is here particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Wherefore glorifie ye the Lord in the fires,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe may be the words of the Prophet, ſtirring up Gods people to go on in praiſing God, as in the foregoing verſe he had foretold they ſhould do; but yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken to be the words of the remnant before ſpoken of, who eſcaping that publick Deſolation that was coming upon the earth, ſhould not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves praiſe God with a loud voice, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe; but ſhould alſo, as is here ſaid, ſtir up others to do the ſame, even from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their deliverance. Some render the words, as in the Margin of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Glorifie the Lord in the valleys;</hi> and they hold, that <hi>the valleys</hi> are named, either becauſe the Valleys are uſually moſt inhabited, by reaſon of the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of water and plenteous feeding that is there to be had; or elſe to imply, that even in the darkeſt Corners of the earth, in the baſeſt and obſcureſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the World, the Praiſes of the Lord ſhould be heard. But they are beſt rendred, I conceive, as in our Tranſlation, <hi>Wherefore glorifie ye the Lord in the fires;</hi> that is, Ye that are in the fires of great Tribulations and Troubles, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this great work that God hath done upon the earth, and be thereby ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to glorifie God, by truſting in him, and rejoycing in hope of being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him; and let all do this all the world over; which is implied in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>even the Lord God of Iſrael in the Iſles of the Sea.</hi> See the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>From the uttermoſt part of the earth have we heard Songs,</hi> &amp;c.] As if the Prophet had ſaid, What do I ſpeak of glorifying God in the Valleys, and in the Iſles of the Sea? We the people of God have heard Praiſes ſung to our God, even from the uttermoſt parts of the earth. Only we muſt know, that though the Prophet ſpeaks of this, as of a thing done already, to imply the unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able certainty of it; yet his meaning is, That this ſhould be done hereafter; the time was coming when they ſhould hear Pſalms of Praiſe ſung unto God, even from the remoteſt parts of the earth. And though we may ſay, that there was an initial accompliſhment of this, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were delivered out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and other Nations were at the ſame time ſet free, that had been held in bondage by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> yet I conceive, the full performance of this, was not till the Gentiles were brought in to the Church, and ſo joyned with the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſinging Pſalms of Praiſe unto God. And accordingly we muſt underſtand the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe, wherein the ſubject-matter of thoſe their Songs of Praiſe is ſet forth, <hi>even glory to the Righteous,</hi> to wit, either 1. That they ſhould glorifie the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, becauſe he had by his righteous Judgments reſcued poor Priſoners and Captives from the bondage of their proud Enemies, that had tyrannized
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42788:137"/>
over them; or, becauſe he had manifeſted himſelf to be a righteous God by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his promiſes concerning Chriſt, and the calling of the Gentiles: Or, 2ly as ſome would have it, That they ſhould ſpread abroad the Glory of Chriſt their Redeemer, who is indeed often termed <hi>the Righteous</hi> in the Scripture, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I ſaid, My leanneſs, my leanneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have this rendred, as it is in the Margin, <hi>My ſecret to my ſelf, my ſecret to my ſelf;</hi> and that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be, That he concluded confidently of that which God had ſecretly imparted to him; to wit, That the wicked ſhould be deſtroyed, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſpared; Or, that the Prophet durſt not reveal that which was ſecretly made known to him, but kept it to himſelf; namely, that of thoſe that ſhould thus praiſe God and Chriſt, there ſhould be ſo few of his own Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Gentiles being for the generality admitted to be Gods peculiar people; which is altogether improbable. That Tranſlation therefore, which we have in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is far the better, <hi>But I ſaid, my leanneſs, my leanneſs.</hi> And ſo the words contain a very pathetical Expreſſion of the Prophets grief for the deſperate wickedneſs of his own people, and the wrath and vengeance which it would certainly bring upon them; it is all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, that he did even continually waſte and pine away with grief, notwithſtanding the great joy which he foreſaw would accrue to that eſcaping remnant, of which he had ſpoken, when he took notice how great the wickedneſs of Gods people was, and how dreadful the Judgments were, which this would bring upon them, which is the more evident by the following Complaint, <hi>Wo unto me, the treacherous dealers have dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherouſly:</hi> which ſeems clearly to be meant of that peoples treacherous dealing with God, to whom they ſtood obliged for ſo many ſingular mercies, and to whom they had ſo often engaged themſelves; yet I cannot but add, that it is not altogether improbable, which ſome ſay, that thoſe words, <hi>My leanneſs, my leanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. might be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as in the perſon of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſet forth what a thin and ſmall company there ſhould be of them amongſt the people of God, when the Church ſhould be mightily enlarged by the flowing in of the Gentiles; Or, that the Prophet might thereby bewail the ſad Condition the Church ſhould be in, even in the days of the Goſpel, by the baſe and treacherous dealing of thoſe that lay in her own boſom.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Fear, and the pit, and the ſnare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the earth.]</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. There ſeems to be in the words an Alluſion to that which was uſually done in the hunting of wild beaſts, wherein, firſt the beaſts are rouſed with a fright and fear, by the out-cry and hallowing of the Huntſmen, and the barking of the dogs; and then fleeing away, they fall into ſome <hi>pit</hi> that was digged for them; or, if they eſcape them, they are taken in ſome toils or ſnares that were ſet for them. But the meaning is, that God would follow <hi>the Inhabitants of the earth</hi> with variety of Judgments (even while he ſpared that ſmall remnant, to whom, in the foregoing words he had promiſed to ſhew mercy) ſo that the generality of them ſhould be utterly deſtroyed; if they eſcaped one Judgment, another ſhould ſurprize them, as is more fully
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42788:137"/>
expreſt in the following verſe, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that he who fleeth from the noiſe of the Jews, ſhall fall into the pit,</hi> &amp;c. See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 20.24.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>For the windows from on high are open,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>The windows of heaven,</hi> as it was in <hi>Noahs</hi> deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. to which the Prophet ſeems here to allude. The meaning is, That God would pour down his Judgments from heaven upon them, as once upon the old World, or upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>and the foundations of the earth do ſhake,</hi> as it were for fear; ſee the Notes 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8. and <hi>Job</hi> 9.6. Both Expreſſions joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, clearly imply, That God would arm both Heaven and Earth againſt them, ſo that his Vengeance ſhould break forth upon them, both from above and from beneath; and therefore there would be no eſcaping for them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean diſſolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.]</hi> Having ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>the foundations of the earth do ſhake;</hi> with reſpect hereto he now addeth, That the earth and all things thereon ſhould be utterly broken and ſhattered to pieces. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That the Kingdoms and States of the earth, againſt which the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this Chapter is directed, ſhould be utterly and irrecoverably deſtroyed, and left wholly in Confuſion and Deſolation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>The earth ſhall reel to and fro like a Drunkard,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, It is near to ruine; Or, the Inhabitants thereof are at their wits end, and know not which way to turn themſelves; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.14. <hi>and ſhall be removed like a Cottage,</hi> to wit, like ſome Shed or Tent, which Travellers ſet up to lodg in by night, and then in the Morning pull it down, and carry it away with them. It may be meant of the Ruine and Overthrow of States, Towns and Cities, or the carrying away of the people into Captivity; <hi>and the Tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it,</hi> that is, Their grievous ſins, the cauſe of all their miſery, ſhall bring heavy Judgments upon them; <hi>and it ſhall fall, and not riſe again;</hi> that is, it ſhall be utterly ruined, and ſhall never recover its former Splendor and Glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that any, that the Lord ſhall puniſh the hoſt of the high Ones, that are on high,</hi> &amp;c.] Some by <hi>the hoſt of the high ones,</hi> whom God would puniſh, do underſtand the Devils, whom the Apoſtle terms <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi> Others underſtand hereby the darkning of the Sun, and Moon and Stars, the Hoſt of Heaven, or any prodigious ſigns in them; thereby to ſtrike the inhabitants of the earth with terror, of which the Prophet ſpeaks in the following verſe; or Gods deſtroying the Idol-images of theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly lights, ſee the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. and 19.1. And again others underſtand it of the Church and People of God, whom God had advanced on high above all other Nations, and whom God would puniſh, as well as others. But there is no juſt ground for any of theſe Expoſitions. That which is moſt probable, and is approved by the beſt Expoſitors, is, that by <hi>the hoſt of the high ones, that are on high,</hi> is meant, either the Kings and Princes of the earth in general, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their forces, that are lifted up high above other men, and that ſhine gloriouſly in the world, like the heavenly lights in the Firmament (and then the following words, <hi>and the Kings of the earth, upon the earth,</hi> ſeem to be added by way of explaining theſe) or elſe more particularly, thoſe proud <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42788:138"/>
                  <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs and Potentates, ſuch as were <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> with their mighty Armies, that were Kings of Kings, as one of them is called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37. And then by the following words, <hi>And the Kings of the earth, upon the earth,</hi> are meant thoſe petty Kings, that were Vaſſals to the other; of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, as of Princes that had their Thrones on the ground, in compariſon of the other, their great Lords, that ſeemed to have their Thrones above the Clouds and the Stars. And ſo the drift of the whole verſe is to ſhew, that there was none amongſt the wicked ſo high, but God would pull them down.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And they ſhall be gathered together, as priſoners are gathered in the pit, and ſhall be ſhut up in the Priſon,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As Malefactors are brought in from ſeveral places, and clapped up together in the Goal; ſo ſhall theſe great ones, mentioned in the foregoing verſe, <hi>be gathered together,</hi> and kept in ſafe cuſtody. And the meaning of this may be, either 1. That they ſhould be held and bound ſo faſt by the Almighty Power of God, in that low and baſe eſtate whereinto they ſhould be brought, that they ſhould be no more able to extricate themſelves out of it, than Priſoners are able to make an eſcape out of ſome ſtrong Dungeon, where they are laid together. Or, 2. that they ſhould be together carried Captives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> their multitude ſhould no way ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them. Or, 3. that they ſhould be ſlain and laid up together in the grave, the pit whereinto people are frequently in Scripture ſaid to be <hi>gathered.</hi> But now if the words ſhould be underſtood this laſt way, then the following clauſe, <hi>and after many days ſhall they be viſited,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be meant of a farther Viſitation in wrath, to wit of God's delivering them up at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſhould be raiſed out of the pit of the grave, to the eternal Torments of Hell. Or elſe that clauſe muſt be read, as out of <hi>Junius</hi> we have it in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>And after many days ſhall they be found wanting;</hi> that is, they ſhall no more of a long time be found lifting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a way of enmity againſt God. All which being not improbable, I doubt not but that this laſt clauſe is added as a promiſe of Grace and Favour, <hi>And after many days ſhall they be viſited,</hi> to wit, in Mercy. And it may be meant, either, 1. Of the deliverance of thoſe before threatned, from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> bondage; to wit, that they or their Poſterity ſhould after many years be ſet at liberty by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> See the Note, Chap. 23.17. Becauſe they had long provoked, by their wickedneſs, therefore they ſhould be a long time kept there in ſore Bondage; but yet at length, <hi>after many days,</hi> deliverance ſhould come. Or 2. of God's viſiting their Poſterity in wonderful Mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kingdom of Chriſt, by ſending him into the world, and cauſing the way of Life through him to be made known to them by the Preaching of the Goſpel; for that this is here included, the following verſe doth clearly ſhew.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Then the Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When after this execution of Divine Vengeance on his enemies, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all the world over, God ſhall at laſt viſit them in mercy, as was ſaid in the cloſe of the foregoing verſe, (which though it may be meant initially of God's delivering his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet it muſt needs be principally meant of God's gracious viſiting his people under the Kingdom of Chriſt in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42788:138"/>
the days of the Goſpel) with ſuch exceeding glory and brightneſs ſhall the Greatneſs and Majeſty of God ſhine forth in this Kingdom of Chriſt, that the Sun and Moon ſhall be aſhamed to ſhew their faces; their brightneſs ſhall be as no brightneſs, yea as mere darkneſs in compariſon of that; when the glory of this Sun of Righteouſneſs, and Day-ſpring from on high ſhall ſhine forth in the world, it ſhall darken all the glory and magnificence of all earthly ſtates and worldly things, even as a greater light doth darken the leſs; <hi>When the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reign in Mount</hi> Zion <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and before his ancients gloriouſly;</hi> That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when God in Chriſt ſhall in his Church, gathered out of all Nations, (of which <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a type) reign ſo gloriouſly, and diſcover ſo much of his excellent glory in their protection, and ſpiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the holineſs which he ſhall work in them here, and the glory and happineſs which he ſhall clothe them with in Heaven hereafter; and his Saints taking notice thereof, ſhall be ſtill admiring it, and praiſing his name. For though <hi>his ancients</hi> are only here mentioned, his Magiſtrates and Miniſters; yet under theſe, as their repreſentatives, the whole body of God's people is underſtood.

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. O <hi>Lord, thou art my God,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive this to be a Song of Praiſe, uttered as in the perſon of God's Church and people; yea of the Church of Believers in the New Teſtament, God's Elders or <hi>Ancients</hi> mentioned in the cloſe of the foregoing Chapter: But I ſee not why it may not be as well taken as the Prophets own Doxology. Being deeply affected, and even tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with the conſideration of thoſe wonderful works of God, foretold in the former Chapter, concerning the dreadful Judgments he would execute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked, both amongſt his own people, and all the Nations about them, in a manner all the world over; concerning his gracious preſervation of a remnant, which he would reſerve for himſelf; and eſpecially concerning the excellent diſcovery he would make of his tranſcendent Majeſty and Glory in the Kingdom of Chriſt (the laſt thing mentioned in the foregoing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter) here on a ſudden he leaves his Prophetical Diſcourſe, and breaks forth abruptly, as it were, into a Pſalm of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, as admiring the counſels and courſes of God therein: <hi>O Lord, thou art my God:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Whatever wicked men may do, my ſoul ſhall wholly cleave to thee; <hi>I will exalt thee, I will praiſe thy Name,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.9. <hi>For thou haſt done wonderful things;</hi> he ſpeaks of the wonderful things which he had foretold ſhould be done, as if they had been done already; and ſee the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42788:139"/>
Notes, Chap. 9.6. <hi>Thy counſels of old are faithfulneſs and truth;</hi> that is, that which thou didſt long ſince foretel, or thy Promiſes and Threatnings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou didſt reveal to thy people what from Eternity thou hadſt determined to do, thou haſt moſt truly and faithfully performed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For thou haſt made of a City, an heap; of a defenced City, a ruin,</hi> &amp;c.] There is no juſt ground why this ſhould be reſtrained, as ſome would have it, either to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Samaria,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſeat of Antichriſt: It is rather meant generally of God's ruining the Cities, threatned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, for which ſee the Note there, ver. 10. <hi>A palace of ſtrangers to be no City, it ſhall never be built;</hi> that is, Thou haſt utterly ruined the ſtately Royal Cities of the Heathens, the Seats of their great Kings, and that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably too; ſo that they ſhall never be built again, at leaſt not for many generations, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.18. Nor in their former Splendor and Glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Therefore ſhall the ſtrong people glorifie thee; the City of the terrible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall fear thee.]</hi> The meaning is, that becauſe of theſe ruins, which God ſhould bring upon Kingdoms and Cities, either 1. the remaining and ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remnant of thoſe ruined people ſhould be forced to acknowledg God's juſt hand upon them, and dread his mighty power. Or, 2. the neighbour Nations ſhould tremble and be afraid at the conſideration of the Glory and Majeſty of the great God of Heaven and Earth, that had done theſe great things; yea even the mightieſt and moſt terrible of them; as perceiving that no ſtrength of any people could ſecure them from his wrath; and that this ſhould tend much to the Praiſe and Glory of God. Or, 3. the fierce and mighty Nations, that had before carried themſelves moſt proudly and rebelliouſly againſt God, being humbled by theſe Judgments, ſhould be converted to the Faith of Chriſt; and ſo becoming God's people, ſhould praiſe God for his mercy to them, and that not with their lips only, but with their lives too, as being ſuch as ſhould unfeignedly fear and ſerve him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c.] This is mentioned as another of the wonderful works of God, for which the Prophet undertakes here to praiſe his Name; namely, that as he had deſtroyed thoſe mighty ones, ver. 2. ſo he had alſo protected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his poor, weak, afflicted people, where by their low condition they were alſo made low in ſpirit, humbled, and ſo fit for mercy; and had been as a ſtrong Fortreſs to them, to ſecure them from their enemies. <hi>A refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall;</hi> to wit, that ſorely ſhatters or overturns the wall, or at leaſt beats with ſuch violence upon it, that it is likely to carry all before it. The deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the ſiege of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and the Jews from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were remarkable accompliſhments of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But I ſee no reaſon why the place ſhould be reſtrained to either of theſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt bring down the noiſe of ſtrangers,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou ſhalt abate, or ſuppreſs and put an end to, the furious commotions and triumphings of the Heathens, the enemies of thy people: <hi>As the heat in a dry place;</hi> that is, as thou
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42788:139"/>
doſt many times abate and ſuppreſs the heat of the Sun in ſome dry deſert, where otherwiſe there would be no refreſhing for the poor Traveller, neither water to quench his thirſt, nor ſhadowy tree to be a ſhelter to him: <hi>Even the heat with the ſhadow of a cloud,</hi> That is, as thou doſt allay or ſuppreſs the ſcorching heat of the Sun, by the interpoſition of ſome thick Cloud, and ſomtimes by the cooling ſhowers that fall from thence; ſo ſhalt thou abate and cauſe to ceaſe the burning rage and heat of the enemies of thy people againſt them; ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. <hi>The branch of the terrible ones ſhall be brought low.</hi> That is, their Poſterity alſo ſhall be ſo ruined and brought down, that they ſhall not be able to hurt God's people any more. This muſt needs be the meaning of this laſt clauſe, according to our Tranſlation. But indeed many of our beſt Interpreters hold, that it ſhould rather be rendred, <hi>The Song,</hi> or, <hi>the triumph of the terrible ones ſhall be brought low.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And in this mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet having ended his Hymn of Thankſgiving in the foregoing verſes, wherein he had praiſed God for thoſe wonderful things which he had foretold ſhould be done by him, doth here return again to his Prophetical diſcourſe, and ſheweth what God would farther do in thoſe glorious times, whereof he had ſpoken, Chap. 24.13. <hi>And in this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all people a Feaſt of fat things;</hi> that is, Cattel and Fowl fatted, uſually eſteemed the daintieſt food; <hi>A Feaſt of Wines on the lees,</hi> that is, old and ſtrong Wines, not racked, but remaining ſtill upon the lees: This I conceive our Tranſlation muſt needs intend. And true it is, that the remaining of Wines upon the lees for ſome time doth feed and preſerve them, and makes them the ſtronger and the more odoriferous; whence is that, Jer. 48.11. <hi>Moab hath been at eaſe from his youth, and he hath ſetled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from veſſel to veſſel—Therefore his taſte remained in him, and his ſcent is not changed.</hi> Yet ſome I know underſtand hereby pure refined Wines, drawn off from the dregs and lees, and therefore not muddy, but clear; and ſo hold that the next words are added to explain theſe, <hi>Of fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the lees well refined.</hi> But however all this muſt be underſtood Spiritually, to wit, that in the Church of Chriſt (that Mountain mentioned before, Chap. 24.13. whereof <hi>Zion</hi> was a Type, ſee the Notes, Chap. 2.2, 3.) God would feaſt his people of all Nations; not Jews only, but Gentiles too, 1. here in this life with the ſweet comforts of Chriſt, tendred them in the Goſpel and Goſpel-Ordinances, together with the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit, (for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2.) with reſpect whereto our Saviour himſelf doth in like manner compare the preaching of the Goſpel to <hi>a great Supper,</hi> Luk. 14.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42788:140"/>
indeed more probably ſay, That the Prophet might have ſome reſpect in that which is ſaid here to the occaſion which God would give both the Jews and other Nations of exceeding great joy by their deliverance out of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Captivity, (and that in expreſſing this, he compares God to ſome great King, making a Feaſt to his Nobles and Captains after ſome great Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him.) Yet certainly this was only looked to as a Type of that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spiritual Feaſt, which is here principally intended; namely, the Celeſtial Joy which he would beſtow upon his people of all Nations in and through Chriſt, firſt by the glad tydings of the Goſpel, and afterward by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf for ever in his Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And he well deſtroy in this mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet begins to recite the dainties they ſhould have in the Feaſt promiſed in the foregoing verſe; that is, the benefits that ſhould redound to them by Chriſt: And the firſt he mentions is, that in his Church he will utterly deſtroy <hi>the face of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering caſt over all people, and the veil that is ſpread over all Nations;</hi> that is, he will free his people from that blindneſs and ignorance, that vail of darkneſs which lies naturally upon the minds of all mankind, ſo that they cannot find the way unto Life Eternal, and of which the Apoſtle ſpeaking, as with reſpect unto the Jews, ſaith, <hi>Which vail is done away in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.14. Some, I know, by this deſtroying <hi>the face of the covering caſt over all people,</hi> do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſt's deſtroying Death; and that in the expreſſion here uſed, there is an Alluſion to the Face-cloth, wherewith the faces of dead men are wont to be covered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.44. or to the cuſtom of covering the faces of condemned Malefactors, ſee the Note <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.8. But this of Chriſt's deſtroying Death, is added in the next verſe; and the former therefore is rather here intended; namely, the freeing of his people from that ignorance under which they lay by Nature, by the enlightning of the Goſpel, which was ſignified by the rending of the Veil of the Temple at the Death of Chriſt. And all this is ſaid ſhould be done <hi>in this mountain,</hi> as before, not only becauſe it ſhould be done in the Church, made up both of Jews and Gentiles; but alſo becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, whereby this was to be done, was at firſt to go out of Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> See the Notes Chap. 2.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>He will ſwallow up death in victory,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He will deſtroy Death for ever, (as the word in the Original, here tranſlated <hi>in victory,</hi> doth properly ſignifie) ſo that it ſhall never more prevail over his redeemed ones; but Chriſt ſhall reign, this his laſt Enemy being deſtroyed for ever and ever.

of her weeping little Child: For though God doth this partly by the comforts of his Word and Spirit here, yet it is not completely done till they be taken up into Heaven; to which eſtate therefore this paſſage is applied by St. <hi>John,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 7.17. and 21.4. And ſo likewiſe in the next clauſe, <hi>And the rebuke</hi> (or, reproach) <hi>of his people ſhall be taken away from off all the earth;</hi> the meaning is, that God would free his people from that extreme ſcorn and contempt which was caſt upon them all the world over; and from the worlds baſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightful uſage of them, in their continual afflicting and perſecuting of them, as if they were a people not worthy to live upon the face of the earth. But now the accompliſhment of this here principally intended, is the exceeding Glory whereunto God's people ſhall be advanced in Heaven. For when God ſhall take them into this bleſſed and glorious condition, then indeed all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth ſhall be effectually taken off from that vile and baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem which they formerly had of them. Many good Expoſitors do, I know, apply all this to the deliverance of God's people out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But it is only as looking upon that as a Type of this far greater deliverance, promiſed to God's redeemed ones in and through the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And it ſhall be ſaid in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>In that day</hi> when theſe Promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed, the people of God ſhall ſay, to wit, with wonder and exceeding great joy, (for this is, as it were, the language of the Gueſts at the Feaſt mentioned before, ver. 6.) <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us,</hi> &amp;c. Which may be underſtood, 1. in the Type, of the rejoycing of God's people at the Lord's delivering them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which they had long expected, and came at laſt to paſs according to God's Promiſe and their earneſt expectation. And taking it thus, obſervable it is, that in this expreſſion of their preſent joy and confidence in God, they do withal covertly judg and condemn themſelves; becauſe before their being carried into <hi>Babylon</hi> by their diſobeying God's Laws, and ſeeking to foreign Princes for help in their dangers, they had not carried themſelves towards the Lord, as now they found they ſhould have done. Or, 2. of the people of God's owning Chriſt at his coming in the fleſh, and embracing him by Faith, when tendred to them in the Goſpel, as the true God, their Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, long ago promiſed them, with great joy, becauſe of the peace made by him between God and them. Or, 3. of the Churches triumphing in Chriſt, when he ſhall come to judge the world, and to receive them into his Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For in this Mountain ſhall the hand of the Lord reſt.]</hi> That is, His powerful Providence ſhall be conſtantly and continually over his Church to protect and bleſs them.

The word which we render <hi>trodden down,</hi> ſome tranſlate <hi>threſhed,</hi> and accordingly they read this verſe thus, <hi>And Moab ſhall be threſhed under him, even as ſtraw is threſhed in Madmenah;</hi> and then take <hi>Madmenah</hi> to be a City of <hi>Moab,</hi> called <hi>Madmen,</hi> Jer. 48.2. and hold, that becauſe this City being ſcituate in a rich Corn-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where there was abundance of ſtraw, which was the leſs regarded, thence the Prophet uſeth this expreſſion here of <hi>ſtraw threſhed in Madmenah.</hi>

But clearly, as I conceive, this is ſpoken of God, <hi>That he ſhall ſpread forth his hands in the midſt of them, as he that ſwimmeth ſpreadeth forth his hands to ſwim:</hi> And the meaning of this Similitude ſeems to be, either that breaking in upon <hi>Moab</hi> he ſhould with all earneſtneſs, as with both hands, lay on upon them on every ſide, and that again and again, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually without intermiſſion, not only in the skirts of the Country, but even in the midſt and heart of the Land. Yea, not giving over till he had paſſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough it, and had every where executed his Judgments upon them, and ſubdued the whole Land under his power. Or elſe, that he ſhould eaſily and without any oppoſition work his will upon that great and mighty people, even as he that ſwimmeth doth only ſtretch himſelf upon the water, and ſpreading forth his arms doth gently put away the waters before him, and ſo cuts his way through the Sea or Rivers. <hi>And he ſhall bring down their pride,</hi> ſee the Note Chap. 16.6. <hi>together with the ſpoils of their hands.</hi> That is, their wealth, which by rapine and violence they had taken from others.</p>

known to them by the preaching of the Goſpel, ſee the Note, Chap. 24.9. <hi>ſhall this Song be ſung in the Land of Judah:</hi> to wit, at their return from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and in the Church of Chriſt, whereof that Land was a Figure, ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. The meaning is, that the ſtate of the times he now ſpeaks of, ſhould be ſuch, that they might well ſing this Song: yea, and it may well be that this Song was purpoſely compoſed, that in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity the faithful might hereby chear up themſelves with hope of deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have a ſtrong City,</hi> &amp;c.] This may ſeem to be ſpoken as in oppoſition to that which was ſaid ver. 12. of the foregoing Chapter, concerning the Lord's beating down the Cities of <hi>Moab.</hi> Their mightieſt Cities ſhall be laid in the duſt; but <hi>we have a ſtrong City,</hi> to wit, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Church of Chriſt, whereof <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a Type, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail. As this is ſpoken with reſpect to the Jews, when they were come back to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> it may import as much as if they had ſaid, Though our City may ſeem weak in compariſon of what it was before the <hi>Babylonians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it; yet bleſſed be God, we can look upon it as a ſtrong City: <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will God appoint for walls and bulwarks;</hi> that is, God's protection and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation will be to us inſtead of the ſtrongeſt walls and bulwarks. And as it is intended of the Church of Chriſt, the meaning is, that through God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection ſhe ſhall be invincible. And ſome add too, that the Salvation wrought by Chriſt ſhall be the cauſe and ground of this her ſafety.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Open ye the gates, that the righteous Nation which keepeth the Truth, may enter in.]</hi> 1. As this hath reſpect to the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the <hi>gates</hi> may be meant, either the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (thereby to imply the certainty of their return thither, and the multitude of thoſe that ſhould return;) Or (as ſome) the gates of the Temple, which ſhould be re-edified by them, that there they might ſerve and praiſe the Lord; ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7. and 118.19, 20. And this remnant returning may be called <hi>the righteous Nation, which keepeth the truth;</hi> that is, which faithfully in all things keepeth cloſe to the truth of God's Word; both to imply what God required of them upon their return, to wit, that they ſhould not be a wicked, rebellious people, as they had been, but a righteous holy Nation; and likewiſe, becauſe they ſhould be at that time, partly through the cutting off of multitudes of the former wicked generation, and partly through the Repentance of great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe that returned, a people very much reformed and purged from their former droſs. But, 2. as this hath reſpect to the days of the Goſpel, it is clearly a Prediction of the multitude of the Gentiles that ſhould come thronging into the Church of Chriſt, together with the believing Jews, and ſhould not only profeſs the truth of the Goſpel, but alſo be really a righteous people, according to the Rule and Tenor of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he truſteth in thee.]</hi> That is, Thou, God, wilt conſtantly keep that man in all manner of ſolid Peace and Proſperity, whoſe heart doth conſtantly adhere to thee, and rely and reſt upon thee in all conditions whatſoever: Either God will outwardly protect and proſper ſuch, or in their troubles he will bear up their hearts with inward comfort and peace. See the Notes, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.10. &amp; 119. 165.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:42788:142"/>Ver. 4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Conſtantly unto the end, whatever be the outward Diſpenſations of God's Providence towards you. Thus from that which is ſaid in the foregoing verſe, the faithful do mutually encourage one another, <hi>For in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> to wit, for the protecting and proſpering of thoſe that truſt in him. See the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. That which we render <hi>everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> is in the Hebrew, <hi>The rock of ages,</hi> for which ſee the Note <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For he bringeth down them that dwell on high,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The mighty Potentates and Tyrants of the world, that dwell in lofty Palaces and high-walled Cities, or that are in ſtate exalted far above others, ſee the Note, Chap. 24.21. And this is added alſo as a reaſon, why the righteous that truſt in God may expect to be delivered from the Oppreſſion of their greateſt enemies. <hi>The lofty City he layeth it low;</hi> that is, He ruinates their ſtrongeſt and beſt-defenced Cities, <hi>He layeth it low, even to the ground, he bringeth it even to the duſt;</hi> ſee the Note, Chap. 25.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>The foot ſhall tread it down, even, the feet of the poor,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Even God's poor afflicted people ſhall ſubdue thoſe their high fenced Cities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power; or by way of contempt ſhall trample upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The way of the juſt is uprightneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The ways and courſes of the faithful are in all conditions very juſt and upright: <hi>Thou, moſt upright, doſt weigh the path of the juſt;</hi> that is, Thou, O Lord, who art moſt upright thy ſelf, doſt exactly know and conſider the ways of juſt, upright men; whereby is implied, Either 1. that God being moſt upright, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and liking the juſt and upright ways of his faithful ſervants, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly aſſiſt and proſper them in their ways, and make their way plain and even before them, ſo that they may go on comfortably therein. Or, 2. that comparing together the upright ways of the righteous, with the perverſe and falſe ways of the wicked, he doth proſper the one, and deſtroy the other. Or, 3. that he doth ſo afflict them by their enemies when they go aſtray, that he is very ready to deliver them again from their enemies upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I know many underſtand this whole verſe, of God's making the way of his people by his Providence fair and plain before them; and accordingly that word, which we tranſlate <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> they render <hi>evenneſs,</hi> or <hi>ſtreightneſs, The way of the juſt is evenneſs;</hi> and ſuitably they render alſo the following words, <hi>Thou, moſt upright, doſt level the path of the juſt.</hi> But according to our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the meaning of the place ſeems clearly to be that which is before ſaid.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Yea, in the way of thy Judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee.]</hi> Having ſpoken in the foregoing verſe of the tender reſpect which God hath always to his righteous Servants, here he ſheweth what their aſſured confidence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this had wrought in them; to wit, that even in the way of his <hi>Judgments,</hi> that is, under his foreſt chaſtiſements, they waited upon God in hope, that of his infinite Goodneſs and Mercy he would at laſt deliver them, and receive them again into his favour. Now the afflictions which God had brought upon his people he calls <hi>Judgments,</hi> becauſe therein God ſeems to carry himſelf as a Judg, puniſhing them for their ſins; but yet in deſpenſing of them he doth all with judgment and moderation, and wholly with a purpoſe to do them
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42788:142"/>
good, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 11.32. <hi>But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> And this expreſſion, <hi>In the way of thy judgments,</hi> is becauſe it is God's uſual and conſtant way to afflict his people when they go aſtray, for their ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I know ſome underſtand this thus, That the faithful waited upon God in the Way of his <hi>Judgments,</hi> that is, in a way of conſtant obeying his Commandments, or in a way which he had preſcribed them in his word. But the whole Context ſheweth it is meant of the chaſtiſements wherewith he had chaſtiſed his people. See the Note above, ver. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.]</hi> That is, Even in our greateſt troubles our affections were not taken off from thee, (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17.) nor did we caſt off our confidence in thee, but ſtill our thoughts were upon thee, thy word and promiſes: We ſtill panted after thy favour, and ſought after, and waited for thy help and deliverance, earneſtly deſiring that the glory of thy Name might thereby be advanced.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>With my Soul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.]</hi> That is, I have deſired thy favour, thy gracious preſence and help at all times, even by night, whilſt others ſlept, and ſo ſtill will do with all poſſible diligence. And this is ſpoken as in the name of every ſeveral perſon amongſt the righteous, that in this Song are brought in praiſing God's Name. <hi>For when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſs.]</hi> This is added to ſhew how they had been brought ſo to ſeek after God, as was ſaid in the foregoing words; namely by the Judgments they had lain under, mentioned before ver. 8. <hi>In the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee.</hi> It is as if they had ſaid, And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is uſual with men all the world over, to be brought by thy Judgments to learn Righteouſneſs. Yet the meaning is not, that all men are by God's Judgments won to true Repentance; but that uſually when Mercies do no good upon men, yet Judgments bring them in, either ſeriouſly to repent and amend their lives, or at leaſt to make an outward ſhew of doing ſo. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.16. which is farther ſet forth in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe what effect the Judgments of God do commonly work in men, to wit, that thereby they are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ught <hi>to learn righteouſneſs,</hi> (for which ſee the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note) here they add, that indeed ſome wicked wretches will not be brought to learn Righteouſneſs, neither by Mercies nor Judgments. How little Mercies prevail with them, is ſhown in this verſe, <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteouſneſs, in the land of uprightneſs will he deal unjuſtly;</hi> whereby may be meant, either <hi>Judea,</hi> called the Holy Land, which God had given as an inheritance to his own peculiar people, whom he required to be a righteous, holy people; or the Church of Chriſt, where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of Life and Converſation is ſtrictly required and practiſed; but ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>And will not behold the Majeſty of the Lord,</hi> that is, though the Lord doth by never ſo many wonderful works clearly diſcover the Glory and Majeſty of all his Divine Attributes, yet will they take no notice of it. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.5. And then how little they were better'd by God's Judgments, is ſhewn in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42788:143"/>Ver. 11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though thou doſt puniſh them never ſo ſorely, with the ſtrokes of a hand lifted up; or rather, though thy Judgments be executed upon them in ſuch a manner, that it is moſt apparent that thou haſt a ſpecial hand therein, every one may ſee that they are the ſtroaks of Divine Vengeance; yet they will not take any notice of it: <hi>But they ſhall ſee,</hi> that is, they ſhall be foreed to take notice of it, <hi>and be aſhamed for their envy at the people,</hi> or, <hi>towards thy people;</hi> that is, their envying the welfare of God's people, and ſpiteful endeavouring to do them all the miſchief they could: <hi>Yea, the fire of thine enemies ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</hi> That is, the vengeance wherewith, as with fire, thou art wont to deſtroy thine enemies, ſhall conſume them. See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.9. and 97.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us,</hi> &amp;c.] As if they had ſaid, Whilſt thou deſtroyeſt our enemies, thou wilt order it ſo, that we thy people ſhall be in a proſperous and happy condition: As thou haſt afflicted us, ſo thou wilt now alſo ordain peace for us, ſee the Note above, ver. 3. and Chap. 9.6. <hi>For thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us;</hi> that is, all the good we have done or do, with reſpect whereto, we hope, thou wilt afford us this peace, thou haſt wrought it in us by thy Holy Spirit. But indeed the moſt and beſt Expoſitors would have this read, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>For thou alſo haſt wrought all our works for us;</hi> and accordingly they underſtand it paſſively of the works that had been done for them; as if they had ſaid, All that hath befallen us, all that hath been done by our ſelves or others, tending to our peace, all our preſervations and wonderful deliverances, have been the work of thy hands: And thus from the experience of what God had hitherto done for them, they encourage themſelves to hope in God, that he would yet further do them good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>O Lord our God, other lords beſides thee have had dominion over us,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Other Lords, beſides thee, who art our Soveraign Lord, and beſides thoſe whom thou haſt appointed to rule over us, have unjuſtly and tyrannically uſurped Dominion over us. And this, as it is ſpoken with reſpect to the Jews, is meant of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and other foreign Tyrants, that had ruled over them; and as it reſpects the Church of Chriſt, it may be meant of all that at any time do tyrannically oppreſs them. <hi>But by thee only will we make mention of thy Name.</hi> That is, by thy Grace only, as we have hitherto, ſo we will ſtill own our ſelves to be thy ſervants, and make mention of thee as our true Lord and Soveraign, and worſhip and praiſe thy Name. Or, by thy Grace ſupporting us, or by the confidence we have in thee alone, we will ſtill make mention of thy Name, as glorying in thee, as believing that out of reſpect to thine own Name, thou wilt preſerve us that we may honour thee and ſerve thee, though for the preſent thou ſeemeſt to neglect us, and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming the bare remembrance of thy Name to be ſufficient to ſupport our hopes. Or, though our enemies have for a long time tyrannized over us, yet by thy free goodneſs only, and by thy good hand of Providence over us in preſerving and delivering us, without which nothing elſe could have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted any thing thereunto, we may now, and will always, as we have juſt cauſe, own thee, and cleave to thee, and praiſe thy Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42788:143"/>Ver. 14. <hi>They are dead, they ſhall not live; they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe,</hi> &amp;c.] As if they had ſaid, Whilſt thou haſt ordained peace for us, thine own People, thoſe our great Lords that did for a time tyrannize over us, are irrecoverably deſtroyed; they ſhall never be able to riſe again to their former eſtate, to trouble and oppreſs thy People, no more than they that are dead and laid in their graves are able to riſe from thence, and to live again in the world, as formerly they did; ſee the Note, Chap. 24.20. Or, they are ſlain and dead, and ſhall never live upon earth any more. <hi>Therefore haſt thou viſited and deſtroyed them,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, That they might be irrecoverably cut off from the earth, and never more flouriſh in the world, and afflict thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they have done.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Thou haſt encreaſed the Nation, O Lord, thou haſt encreaſed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have this underſtood of God's encreaſing and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the benefits he conferred upon his people. But according to our Tranſlation, it is the encreaſe of their number that is here intended. And it may be ſpoken either, 1. with reſpect to God's exceeding multiplying the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> in former ages. Or more particularly of their encreaſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that even there the more they were oppreſſed, the more they multiplied; as was ſeen by the multitudes of thoſe that returned from thence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants were by this means mightily encreaſed. Or, 2. with reſpect to the great encreaſe of that his peculiar people, by bringing in multitudes of the Gentiles, who joyned themſelves to the Church of the believing Jews, and became one people with them. And as for the following words, <hi>Thou art glorified;</hi> either it is meant of the glory that redounded to God, by the great multitudes that returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the deſtruction of their enemies, which made way to their deliverance: Or by the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion he made to his Church, by the Converſion of the Gentiles. Or elſe of God's glorifying himſelf by his chaſtiſement of his own people, (See the Note, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3.) to wit, in cauſing them to be carried captives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> of which that is clearly meant, which is added in the laſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>Thou hadſt removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.</hi> See the Note, Chap. 6.42. The drift of this place therefore ſeems to be, the ſetting forth of the Lord's different dealing with his people and with their enemies; theſe he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed; but though he chaſtiſed his people ſharply, yet the iſſue of their afflictions was good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee,</hi> &amp;c.] As if they had ſaid, When thou, Lord, didſt viſit thy people with the rod of affliction, then did they viſit thee, of whom they had been too forgetful, in a way of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſeeking to thee for mercy. <hi>They poured out a prayer, when thy chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was upon them,</hi> ſee the Notes 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4. The word in the Hebrew which we tranſlate <hi>a Prayer,</hi> is properly <hi>a Spell,</hi> or <hi>a Charm,</hi> or <hi>a ſecret Speech,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the Margin of our Bibles; the intent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to ſhew, That in their Prayers, by reaſon of extream ſhame and grief for their ſins, and the terrors of God that lay upon their ſpirits, they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak or utter what they would ſay, as it was with <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Chap. 38.14. they poured out their ſouls with
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42788:144"/>
tears, ſighs <hi>and groanings that cannot be expreſſed,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> &amp;c.] When the throws of a travelling woman are indeed ſharpeſt and hardeſt to be born; <hi>is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.8. <hi>ſo have we been in thy ſight, O Lord;</hi> that is, So extream have our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and miſeries been, as thou, O Lord, haſt ſeen and known. And this may be added, as that which did greatly encreaſe their ſorrow, That God ſhould look on, and ſee them in ſuch extream miſery, and yet afford them no help; even as it muſt needs be a great grief to a Woman in travel, to ſee her friends ſtand by, and never mind to lay hands on her, to afford her any help for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of her delivery.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, With ſtrong deſires we groaned after delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from thoſe Oppreſſions and Miſeries that we lay under; we had many thoughts in our heads, how it might be brought about, and were ready many times to conceive great hopes of what we deſired, and laboured what we could to effect it; but all proved vain, and came to nothing: As a Woman that thought her ſelf to be in pains of travel, and finds at laſt that it was nothing but wind ſhe was tortured with, is no way eaſed (as they are that are delivered of a true birth) but continues ſtill in great torment, ſo hath it been with us; we are quite deceived of the fruit we expected, and ſo there is no end of our ſorrows, but out of one affliction we fall into another. And thus is this explained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth:</hi> That is, We have not effected any thing for the ſuccour or deliverance of our ſelves, or of our Country; <hi>neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen,</hi> that is, We have not been able to ſubdue our enemies the heathen, who in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gods peculiar people, are called <hi>the inhabitants of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live,</hi> &amp;c.] Frequently in the Scripture men in extremity of miſery, and that ſeem to be in a loſt Condition, paſt all hope of recovery, are ſpoken of <hi>as dead men,</hi> yea, as men dead and buried, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into duſt, ſee the Notes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.12. and 22.15. and 88.5, 6. and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo the raiſing up men from ſuch a ſad, deſperate and hopeleſs Condition, putting them into a more comfortable Eſtate, is ſpoken of as a reviving of ſuch dead men, and a kind of Reſurrection; ſee the Notes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20 and 80.18. And in this ſenſe I conceive theſe words are ſpoken here, of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Gods faithful people out of a forlorn and loſt condition (ſuch as was that of their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi>) and bringing them again into a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and comfortable Eſtate; and that this is added as in oppoſition to that which was ſaid before of the irrecoverable Deſtruction of their Enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>They are dead, they ſhall not live; they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe.</hi> I know that very many Expoſitors of great note, do underſtand this expreſly of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the faithful to life at the laſt day. And indeed, though it were prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meant of the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity (as was alſo that Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> concerning the Reſurrection of dry bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.1, &amp;c.) yet by the Expreſſions here uſed, it may ſeem moſt probable,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42788:144"/>
that there is at leaſt an Alluſion herein to that Reſurrection of the faithful at the day of Judgment; yea, if this ſong were intended to ſet forth, as moſt Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hold, not only the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but alſo that greater deliverance of our Redemption by Chriſt (whereof that other was a type) as is before noted <hi>ver.</hi> 1. then I ſee not why under this great work of the deliverance of Gods people by Chriſt, the raiſing of them up to life at the laſt day ſhould not be comprehended; which ſhall be the full perfecting of that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. The greateſt difficulty in the words, is to know by whom, and to whom they are ſpoken. Now to this I anſwer, 1. That they may be taken as ſpoken to the Church and people of God, either in the perſon of God, or in the perſon of the prophet, ſpeaking to them from God. And if we underſtand them thus, then we muſt ſuppoſe, that in the foregoing verſe the ſong is ended that began <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and that here, in anſwer to that which they had ſaid therein, there is a promiſe made to them from God in Chriſt, that he would certainly raiſe them from that dead and hopeleſs Condition, wherein they lay; <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live.</hi> And accordingly alſo we muſt then underſtand the following words (as they are in our tranſlation) <hi>together with my dead bodys ſhall they ariſe,</hi> either of the dead body of Chriſt; as if it had been ſaid in the perſon of Chriſt, As ſure as my dead ſhall ariſe out of the grave, ſo ſurely ſhall thy dead men ariſe; or elſe of the whole body of his Church and people, thereby to imply, that not one of them ſhould fail to have their ſhare in this joyful Reſurrection. But 2ly. the words may be taken as the words of Gods people, and ſo as the cloſe of the foregoing ſong, wherein they make profeſſion to God of their confident aſſurance, that he would revive them, and raiſe them up from that forlorn and hopeleſs Condition, wherein at preſent they lay; <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live;</hi> as if they had ſaid, Thy poor people, that ſeem to be now as ſo many men dead and buried, thou wilt revive again, and raiſe them up out of this their low and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate Condition, even as at the laſt day thoſe that dye in thee, being true members of thy myſtical body the Church, ſhall be raiſed out of their grave; unto life eternal. And taking the words thus, the following words muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be underſtood accordingly, <hi>together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> either of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſome would have it, to wit, that as that their City that was at preſent as a dead carcaſe, ſhould be raiſed up out of the duſt, ſo ſhould Gods people alſo, together with it; or of the whole body of the Church; or as if the Prophet had ſet forth the unqueſtionable certainty of this promiſe, by comparing it with his full aſſurance concerning the raiſing again of his dead body, ſee <hi>Job</hi> 19.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, you that are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dead carcaſes that have lain long in the Grave; <hi>for thy dew is as the dew of herbs;</hi> which may be alſo taken, either as ſpoken by the Prophet to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, telling them, that their <hi>dew,</hi> that is, the love that God had ſhewed to them, would be to them as dew to the herbs; or elſe as the ſpeech of Gods people to God, rendring a reaſon why they expected ſuch a mighty change in their Eſtate, to wit, Becauſe his favour would be a ſure means to effect this, as the dew is to quicken the dying and withering herbs; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6. it being as eaſie for God to raiſe up his people from their ſeeming hopeleſs Eſtate
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42788:145"/>
to a comfortable and flouriſhing Condition, yea, to raiſe the very dead out of their Graves, as it is by a dew that falls in the night to revive the herbs, that were in a manner withered by the ſcorching of the ſun, and to cauſe them ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſprout out again; <hi>and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead;</hi> that is, It ſhall give up her dead, even as the dew cauſeth the dead roots of herbs to ſprout forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh as formerly.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Come my people,</hi> &amp;c.] The foregoing ſong of Gods people being ended, the Lord doth here by his Prophet adviſe them to take care to provide for the ſheltring of themſelves from that general ſtorm that was coming upon the world before thoſe joyful times, whereof he had hitherto ſpoken; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable it is, that this is expreſſed in ſuch a manner, as if God would tender himſelf to go along with them, and to conduct them to ſuch a place of ſafety, <hi>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers,</hi> that is, betake your ſelves in your fears to the Chambers of my providence and protection, to wit, by a ſerious Meditation of Gods promiſes, and his all-ſufficiency, goodneſs and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, by renewing your Repentance by fervent prayer, and truſting in him, and hoping for deliverance from him; for theſe are the ſecret hiding places under which Gods people may in times of danger and fear, with much peace and quiet of ſpirit, ſhelter themſelves, and patiently repoſe themſelves, and wait for the Salvation of God. See the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 29.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.5. and 31.20. and 91.1, 2. and <hi>Pro.</hi> 91.10. There ſeems to be an Alluſion in the words, to mens keeping within doors in times of ſtormy weather, or to their fleeing to their houſes, and retiring there to the ſecreteſt and ſecureſt places they have, and ſhutting the doors upon themſelves in times of peril and dread: Or, it may be, particularly to that charge which was given to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 12.22. not to ſtir out of the doors of their houſes, whilſt the deſtroying Angel paſſed through the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>and ſhut thy doors about thee;</hi> that is, perſevere conſtantly in the uſe of theſe holy means, for the ſecuring and quieting your ſelves, not admitting any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that ſhould diſquiet or perplex your ſpirits; <hi>hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over-paſt,</hi> See the Note Chap. 10.25.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, There is a great ſtorm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore you had need to hide your ſelves; the Lord ſhall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven appear in his dreadful judgments, executing open vengeance upon thoſe that dwell on the earth, even as a King comes from his Palace to ſit in the Judgment ſeat for the puniſhing of Malefactors. Some I know, hold, That it is the Temple that is here called Gods place, and ſo underſtand the words thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That though for a long time the Lord might ſeem to ſit ſtill in his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and not to mind the wickedneſs of the men of the World, yet at laſt he would come forth and ſhew himſelf by puniſhing them for their ſins. But I rather underſtand it of Gods appearing from heaven, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> And becauſe blood-ſhed, eſpecially the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the blood of Gods people, is a wickedneſs moſt hateful to God, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42788:145"/>
which he doth uſually puniſh moſt ſeverely; therefore is that added, <hi>the earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain;</hi> that is, God ſhall then call men to an account, and puniſh them for all the blood they have ſhed, whether openly or in ſecret, which before ſeemed not to be minded, but to be (as we uſe to ſay) quite forgotten.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>IN that day,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, When the Lord ſhall go forth to puniſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth for their wickedneſs, as was ſaid in the laſt verſe of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>the Lord with his ſore, and great, and ſtrong ſword,</hi> that is, by his infinite power uſed with great ſeverity, <hi>ſhall puniſh Leviathan,</hi> that is, the Whale or Whirlpool, ſee the Notes <hi>Job</hi> 41.1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.26. <hi>the piercing ſerpent,</hi> or as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>the ſerpent croſſing like a bar;</hi> for the underſtanding whereof we muſt know, 1. That all Creatures that glide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, whether by earth or water, with feet or fins, are by the Hebrews called <hi>Serpents:</hi> and 2ly. That the Whale or Whirlpool is here called <hi>a barlike ſerpent,</hi> either becauſe it ſhooteth ſwiftly from one ſide of the ſea to the other, even as a bolt ſhoots ſwiftly into the ſtaple, or a bar from one ſide of the door to the other; or becauſe by reaſon of the huge bulk of his body, and his mighty ſtrength, he ſeems invincible, not to be over-born, moved, or ſtirred by any ſtrength of any Creature, no more than a gate or door can be moved, that is ſhut up with bars of Braſs or Iron: And 3ly. that this is rendred by our Tranſlators, <hi>the piercing Serpent;</hi> either with reſpect to his ſwift piercing through the waves of the Sea, as is before ſaid; or to his devouring or breaking through any thing that ſtands in his way. And ſo likewiſe he is called a <hi>crooked Serpent,</hi> becauſe he paſſeth through the waters wrigling to and fro, with winding and crooking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and <hi>the Dragon,</hi> the better to ſet forth his ſtrength and terror, <hi>even Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan that crooked ſerpent; and he ſhall ſlay the dragon that is in the ſea.</hi> But now the great queſtion is, who this Leviathan was, that is here threatned. Clear it is, that this is meant figuratively of ſome mighty and dreadful Enemy of Gods people. But all the difficulty is in determining who this great enemy here intended was. Some underſtand it of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the rather, becauſe he is elſewhere termed <hi>Leviathan;</hi> See the Notes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.13, 14. <hi>and a whale in the Seas,</hi> Ezek. 32.2. and a Sea-Dragon, Ezek. 29.3. <hi>The great Dragon that lieth in the midſt of his rivers.</hi> Again ſome apply it to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and others to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch, whoſe Dominions lay upon the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And indeed, if we would reſtrain it to one particular, this laſt ſeems moſt probable. But I rather think, that it is to be underſtood generally
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42788:146"/>
and collectively of all cruel and mighty Tyrants, that are enemies to the Church, who for their vaſt Dominions, wherein they rule at their pleaſure, for their Serpentine ſubtilty, their crooked irregular ways, and ſavage cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in devouring and deſtroying men, are compared to theſe huge Sea-Monſters. Yea, conſidering, that the Prophet ſeems here to look beyond the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> deſtroying that Empire, even to that greater deliverance of Gods People by Chriſt, whereof the other was but a type, I ſee not, why the Devil may not be alſo mainly hereby intended, as he makes uſe of wicked Tyrants, as his inſtruments (with reſpect whereto, the expreſſion is uſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20.) who for his great power and ſubtilty, and his Dominion over the wicked all the world over, may well be termed a <hi>Leviathan, the piercing Serpent,</hi> and <hi>the Dragon,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. and the <hi>crooked Serpent,</hi> becauſe he winds and turns himſelf ſo many ways, to deceive and deſtroy men. And taking the words thus, it is in effect all one, as if it had been ſaid, That Chriſt ſhould deſtroy the Devil and his Kingdom, with all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>In that day ſing ye unto her,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when God hath deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his peoples mighty enemies, as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, then ſhall ye with much joy, ſing this following ſong concerning the Church, the Lord's Vineyard; ſee the Notes, Chap. 5.1. <hi>A vineyard of Red wine;</hi> that is, the beſt and moſt generous Wine: for ſuch their red Wine was accounted in the land of <hi>Judea;</hi> whence is that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23.31. <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is all one in effect, as if it had been ſaid, Behold, the Lords Vineyard, that before brought forth nothing but wild grapes (ſee the Note, Chap. 5.2.) and hath thereupon lain a long time deſolate and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down, is now become a Vineyard that yieldeth the choiceſt Wine. And the meaning is, That Gods people were now become a holy and a righteous people, yielding fruit very acceptable to God; which may be meant, partly of Gods people after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but eſpecially of the Church of Chriſt in the days of the Goſpel. However, in the whole there ſeems to he an alluſion to the cuſtom of thoſe times, when at their Vintages they uſed to ſing Songs with a great deal of jollity, by way of extolling the excellency and the fruitfulneſs of their Vineyards.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though of late I have ſeemed wholly regardleſs of her, yet now I will watch over her, to keep and preſerve her; and I will water her with the gracious ſhowrs and dews of my Word and Spirit, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. and with a conſtant ſupply of whatever is requiſite to bring her into a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and flouriſhing Condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> &amp;c.] As if it had been ſaid, ſay ſome good Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, My people being now humbled and reformed, my fury and anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them is quite over: <hi>who would ſet the briars and thorns againſt me in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel? I would go through them, I would burn them together:</hi> that is, If any
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42788:146"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and moleſt them, it will be indeed but as if ſo many briars and thorns ſhould be ſet againſt me in battel, that am a conſuming fire; I would ſoon not only break through them, and trample them down, but alſo burn them up and deſtroy them; ſee the Note, Chap. 10.17. But I rather take this, as ſpoken not of the enemies of his Church, but of his Church and People themſelves; and that it is added by way of preventing an objection that might ariſe in their minds, concerning the Lord's tender care over his people, his Vineyard, in his continual keeping it and watering it. Becauſe they might think, that this promiſe could not conſiſt with that which the Prophet had ſo often told them, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſad calamities and devaſtations that were coming upon them; to this the Lord anſwers, <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> to wit, towards my Church and People. It is, as if he had ſaid, I am not in my ſelf ſubject to be tranſported with furious paſſions, and ſo prone, eaſily and without any juſt cauſe, to break forth in wrath againſt men, and to be implacable therein; but on the contrary, I am ſlow to anger, and very ready to ſhew mercy: and eſpecially it is thus with me, in regard of my people; when I am offended with them, it is with the anger of a loving Father; it is not in fury, and rage, and implacable wrath; and therefore when I ſhall chaſtiſe you, it ſhall be with a purpoſe to reform, and not to deſtroy you; ſo that this being effected in you, I ſhall ſoon make good this promiſe to you. As for the next words, <hi>who would ſet the briars and thorns againſt me in battel? I would go through them, I would burn them together;</hi> the drift thereof is (I conceive) to imply either 1. That if he were furiouſly bent againſt them to deſtroy them, they would be but as ſo many briars and thorns before a conſuming fire; he could eaſily make an end of them; ſo that they might thereby ſee, that it was of his mercy and free grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that they were not conſumed: Or 2. That if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (which he had much rather) with the prophane ones of the world, that he eſteemed no better than ſo many briars and thorns, his wrath ſhould freely break forth againſt them, and utterly conſume them. But with his Vineyard, his inheritance, his own adopted people, he would not, he could not deal thus. Or 3. That if he were to deal only with the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his people, that were as ſo many briars and thorns ſetting themſelves in battel-array againſt him, he would ſoon deſtroy them, and as willingly as the Husbandman deſtroys the briars and thorns in his Vineyard; but with his beloved Vineyard he could not do ſo: If he were purpoſed to deſtroy the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and thorns amongſt them, yet he would be careful to do that ſo, that he might not deſtroy the Vines together with them: Or 4. That if he ſhould find none but briars and thorns amongſt his people, then indeed he ſhould ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; but when they ſhould be a reformed people, he would be far from proceeding in ſuch fury againſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Or let him take hold of my ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. By taking hold on Gods ſtrength, may be meant a ſerious Conſideration of the infinite ſtrength and power of God, either to deſtroy his enemies, or to bleſs his faithful Servants.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42788:147"/>
2ly. An apprehending this ſtrength and power of God by faith, when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and apply the truth hereof unto themſelves: And 3ly. that uſing of all holy means, whereby they may appeaſe his wrath, and ſo ſtay his hand from ſmiting, or burning them up, ſuch as are repentance, and fervent prayer; and whereby they may engage his ſtrength to be put forth for their protection and benefit in every regard. And this is required here, as a means of mens making their peace with God, and preventing their being conſumed with the fire of his Indignation; and that with a promiſe that it ſhall be effectual there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me;</hi> and it may be taken, as ſpoken either to his enemies, thoſe wicked ones that were in his ſight as ſo many briers and thorns, that God would be reconciled even to them, if they would thus ſtay his hand, and make their peace with him: Or elſe to his own people, as an evidence that he was not furiouſly bent againſt them to deſtroy them, becauſe though he could eaſily burn them up, as ſo many briers and thorns, yet he rather deſired that they ſhould thus ſtay his hand, and be at peace with him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>He ſhall cauſe them that come of Jacob to take root,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his Vineyard, the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.9. as is further clear by the following words, <hi>Iſrael ſhall bloſſom and bud;</hi> and the meaning is, That though this people ſhould be for a time like a tree, that ſeems in the winter to be dead and withered, only there is life in the roots; yet like ſuch a tree, it ſhould at length grow up again and flouriſh exceedingly, <hi>and fill the face of the World with fruit,</hi> to wit, the fruit of her mighty encreaſe; which though it were initially fulfilled at the deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet not fully till the coming in of the Gentiles to the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Hath God ſmitten his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his people, as he ſmote thoſe that were their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that ſmote them? as if it had been ſaid, Certainly no: God doth not proceed with the ſame ſeverity and rigor, when he contends with his people, as he doth when he comes to take vengeance on their enemies, whom he hath uſed as his Inſtruments to ſmite and correct his people. And the ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again in the next clauſe, though that be not ſo clear as the former; <hi>or is he ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi> that is, (ſay ſome) Is his <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlain according to the ſlaughter of thoſe that are ſlain <hi>by him?</hi> that is, The <hi>Babylonian, Iſraels</hi> enemy; as if it had been ſaid, That God did not ſlay his people with that cruelty or envy, as that great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> ſlew the <hi>Jews</hi> and others, againſt whom he prevailed: Or, as others ſay, Is his <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlain <hi>according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi> to wit, by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, for his ſake. But rather, by <hi>them that are ſlain by him,</hi> is meant them that are ſlain by God; and ſo that which is intended, is, That God had not ſlain his people according to the ſlaughter wherewith he had ſlain his and their enemies (of whoſe ſlaughtering he had ſpoken of before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and Chap. 26.14.) namely, in wrath and fury, utterly to deſtroy them. The drift of all this is ſtill to make good that which was ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. That God was not furious againſt his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42788:147"/>Ver. 8. <hi>In meaſure, when it ſhooteth forth, thou wilt debate it,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is ſhewn wherein God deals otherwiſe with his vine, his own people, than with their enemies, even when he doth ſmite and correct his people for their ſins; he will do it <hi>in meaſure;</hi> that is, gently, and with much moderation, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he is able to lay upon them (See the Note <hi>Job</hi> 23.6.) nor according to what their ſins have deſerved, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. but with reſpect to their ſtrength, that their ſufferings may not be greater or of longer continuance than they are well able to bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. whereas when he falls upon his and their enemies, he lays on without any regard, or ſtint, or meaſure. As for thoſe words, <hi>when it ſhooteth forth,</hi> therein, as before, Gods people are ſpoken of as <hi>a Vineyard:</hi> The words indeed may be read as they are in the margin, <hi>In meaſure, when thou ſendeſt it forth, thou wilt debate with it;</hi> and ſo this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be uſed with reſpect to Gods ſending forth his people into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to wit, that even then God would debate with this his Vineyard mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; though he ſeemed to have caſt them quite off, yet he had ſtill thoughts of peace towards them: as it is with a Father that turns away his Son, or a Husband, that for ſome offence diſmiſſeth his Wife for a time, when yet both the one and the other intend after a while to receive them back again. But if we read the words as they are in our Bibles, <hi>In meaſure, when it ſhooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it;</hi> the meaning ſeems to be, that though God may contend with his Vineyard when her branches grow luxuriant, or when ſhe is ſpringing and growing up very fairly, yet he will do it <hi>in meaſure;</hi> though he may cut off her branches, he will not grub her up by the root; yea, even in pruning her, he will do it warily, ſo as not to ſpoil the heart of the Vines. And to the ſame purpoſe tend the following words, <hi>he ſtayeth his rough wind in the day of the eaſt wind;</hi> that is, If he bring ſome terrible ſtorm upon her, like a rough Eaſt wind (which is particularly named, becauſe that wind in thoſe Countries uſed to be moſt violent) yet he will ſo allay or ſlacken the boiſterouſneſs of this Storm, that it ſhall not break up the Vines by the roots, though it may beat down or break off ſome of her branches.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged,</hi> &amp;c.] This is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as another great difference betwixt Gods ſmiting his people, and his and their enemies, to wit, that whileſt he ſmites their enemies meerly in a way of vengeance to deſtroy them, he ſmites his people out of pity and fatherly love, that he may pardon and reform them; <hi>and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin,</hi> that is, all the fruit that God propounds to himſelf in correcting his people, and all the benefit that redounds to his people thereby, is the reforming of them, <hi>when he maketh all the ſtones of the altar as chalk-ſtones that are beaten aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> that is, when <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gods people, ſhall manifeſt the truth of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by pulling down and breaking to ſhivers with much zeal, even as men break Chalk-ſtones in pieces to make Lime, all their Altars and other idolatrous Monuments; <hi>the Groves and Images,</hi> (or <hi>Sun-Images) ſhall not ſtand,</hi> that is, they alſo ſhall be hewed and broken down. But ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Yet the defenced City ſhall be deſolate,</hi> &amp;c.] As if it had been ſaid, though God will not proceed, as is before ſaid, with his people, as he doth with their enemies, in puniſhing them, but will onely ſeek the reforming of them;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42788:148"/>
yet that they may be reformed, he will be forced to correct them with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. <hi>The defenced City ſhall be deſolate,</hi> that is, <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other the ſtrong Cities, both in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhall be laid waſte, <hi>and the habitation forſaken, and left like a wilderneſs;</hi> that is, all other their habitations in the Land ſhall be left without Inhabitants; <hi>there ſhall the calf feed, and there ſhall he lie down,</hi> that is, Gods people ſhall be caſt out, and bruit Beaſts ſhall be brought in to feed and dwell there in their ſtead; <hi>and conſume the branches thereof,</hi> that is, they ſhall browſe upon the Plants and Shrubs that ſhall grow up where their Houſes and Cities had wont to be. Some, I know, underſtand this of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in greater fury againſt the enemies of his people, than againſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but that doth not ſuit ſo well with our Tranſlation. And again, ſome think that the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being compared to a Vine, the deſtruction of the People is here intended, by ſaying that Beaſts ſhould <hi>conſume the branches</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to a like figurative expreſſion, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.33, 34. for which ſee the Notes there. But methinks the words in this place ſeem rather to ſet forth the deſolation of their Country, than the deſtruction of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>When the boughs thereof are withered, they ſhall be broken off,</hi> &amp;c.] Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is noted in the foregoing Verſe, ſome underſtand this alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively of the withering, breaking off, and burning the boughs of Gods Vine, his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But rather this is added farther to ſet forth the deſolation of their Town and Cities, by ſhewing, that as the Beaſts ſhould crop the Shrubs that grew there, when they were green, (as was ſaid in the former verſe) ſo being withered, the boughs thereof ſhould be broken off for firing: as is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>the women come and ſet them on fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is a People of no underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, a fooliſh People, that will be made wiſe by nothing but ſtripes; See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.12. and <hi>Deut</hi> 32.28. Probable it is, that this they are charged with, more eſpecially with reſpect to their brutiſh ignorance in forſaking the living God to go after Idol-gods; <hi>therefore he that made them</hi> (See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.11. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.) <hi>will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour;</hi> that is, (ſay ſome who underſtand it of thoſe whom God by this ſeverity intended to reform) God will not at all ſpare them, but will proceed with ſome more than ordinary ſeverity againſt them, even as far as the rigour of fatherly chaſtiſement may extend. But I rather think that this is ſpoken of the body of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon whom God poured forth his wrath without any mixture of mercy, though withall he ſhewed mercy to a remnant amongſt them, as is ſhewn in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] to wit, when God ſhall have proceeded with ſo great ſeverity againſt his own People (as is ſaid in the two foregoing Verſes) and ſhall have thereby in ſome meaſure reformed them; (but ſee alſo the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.11.) <hi>that the Lord ſhall beat off from the channel of the river unto the ſtream of Egypt,</hi> that is, from <hi>Euphrates</hi> (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.20.] unto the River <hi>Sihor,</hi> which lay before <hi>Egypt, Joſh.</hi> 13.3. or unto the River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> either of which may be meant by the River of <hi>Egypt,</hi> See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. And the meaning ſeems to be, that God would ſever and take out his People from the Nations amongſt whom they were ſcattered,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42788:148"/>
in all thoſe Countries that lay between <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Nilus, Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> (for when the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> many of them fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.11.) even as the Husbandman by beating ſevers the Fruit from the Trees; or as by threſhing he beats out the grain from the ears and ſtraw; or as by winnowing he beats out the corn from the chaff. Some indeed do underſtand this of the Lords beating out the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their dwelling places all over the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (which we find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bounded by the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the River of <hi>Egypt</hi>) and others of the beating over of all thoſe Countries that lay between <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Nilus,</hi> by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> when they ſubdued <hi>Babylon.</hi> But the former expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is far the cleareſt, and beſt agrees with that which followeth, <hi>and ye ſhall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Iſrael,</hi> to wit, as Fruit is gathered up that is beaten off the Tree, or as the Corn is gathered up when it is threſhed, and winnowed, and laid up in Garners: the meaning whereof is, that though they were exceedingly diſperſed, yet they ſhould be gathered together into one body, and placed again in their own Land. And this expreſſion of their being gathered <hi>one by one,</hi> is uſed purpoſely to intimate, 1. the paucity of thoſe that ſhould be delivered, in compariſon of thoſe that were at firſt carried away and ſcattered abroad; according to a like expreſſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I will take you one of a City, and two of a Family, and will bring you to Zion.</hi> And 2. the exact bringing in of all that were to have a ſhare in this deliverance, though they were ſevered never ſo far aſunder, that God would pick them up, one out of one place, and another out of another, not one of them ſhould be neglected and loſt, as it is ſaid alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.28. <hi>I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.</hi> But withall we muſt know, that under this bringing home of the <hi>Jews</hi> to their own Land, a greater myſtery was intended by the Prophet, whereof that was a type and ſhadow, even the bringing in of God's elect People to the Church in the days of the Goſpel, firſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> diſperſed throughout the whole World, as was ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.52. <hi>that he ſhould gather together in one, the children of God that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note: <hi>that the great trumpet ſhall be blown;</hi> that is, As by the ſound of trumpets a King gathers an Army, or a Captain calls his Souldiers together that were ſcattered abroad, ſo will I (ſaith the Lord) gather my people together that are diſperſed in ſeveral Countries: which though it were primarily meant of God's bringing home the <hi>Jews</hi> after the Babylonian captivity, into their own Country, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, (as is already ſaid in the foregoing verſe) the ſpiritual gathering in of Gods People to the Church of Chriſt is chiefly intended. And therefore as by <hi>the trumpet</hi> is meant the Proclamation which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made for giving liberty to the <hi>Jews</hi> to return home into their own Country, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1, 2. ſo alſo the preaching of the Goſpel, that Evangelical Trumpet, which was to be ſounded all the World over, for the bringing in of Gods Elect to Chriſt, which may therefore the more fitly be called <hi>a great Trumpet.</hi> And in this expreſſion there may be an alluſion, either 1. to the ſilver Trumpets whereby the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> uſed to be called together to the Tabernacle; or rather 2. to the Jubilee Trumpet, by the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42788:149"/>
ſounding whereof there was liberty proclaimed to Captives, and freedom for all to return to their Inheritances and Poſſeſſions, which had been alienated for a time from them. Or 3. to that Heavenly Trumpet, wherewith at the laſt day all Gods Elect ſhall be gathered together, to enter upon the full fruition of their purchaſed inheritance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. As for the following words, they ſet forth who they were, that amongſt others ſhould be gathered in by this Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>and they ſhall come which were ready to periſh in the land of Aſſyria;</hi> that is, that were in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> (which yet may be alſo meant of the Empire of <hi>Babylon</hi>) as a loſt People, diſperſed, without hope of being ever reſtored to their own Country; <hi>and the outcaſts in the land of Egypt,</hi> to wit, ſuch as fled thither, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods expreſs command, when they were invaded and overcome by the Babylonians, as is ſaid in the foregoing Note; and ſee the Notes alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.3. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.7.2. <hi>and ſhall worſhip the Lord in the holy Mount at Jeruſalem,</hi> and not Idol-gods as they had formerly done; and under this the coming in of Gods Elect to the Church of Chriſt is comprehended.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO to the crown of pride,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins a new Prophecy, <hi>Wo to the crown of pride, to the Drunkards of Ephraim;</hi> See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.9. that is, wo to the Prince-like pride, wherein the ten Tribes do ſo highly exalt themſelves; or rather, wo to the proud State and Kingdom of the ten Tribes, or, wo to <hi>Samaria,</hi> the royal City of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that are even drunk with proſperity, and ſo infatuated with the high conceit of their wealth and ſtrength, that like ſo many drunken mad men, they are fearleſs of all evil, regardleſs both of God and Man, and carry themſelves in every regard, as a people void of all reaſon and underſtanding. This I conceive may be meant by calling them <hi>the Drunkards of Ephraim.</hi> Yet it may well be, that as they are here threatned for their pride (as often elſewhere, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.5. and 7.10.) ſo alſo for their Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Drunkenneſs, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.5. <hi>In the day of our King, the Princes have made him ſick with bottles of wine.</hi> And this ſeems the more probable, becauſe of the following words, wherein the Prophet gives a hint why he had denounced this wo againſt them, <hi>whoſe glorious beauty is a fading flower,</hi> that is, the ſplendor and glory of whoſe State, wherein they do ſo exceedingly pride themſelves, is but like the beauty of a flower, that will be quickly withered and gone, to wit, becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were immediately to invade them, who would ſoon put an end to all their gallantry and pride. (And it may well be that in this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is an alluſion to the Crowns and Garlands of Flowers which they uſed to wear at their drunken Feaſts) <hi>which are on the head of the fat valleys;</hi> that is (ſay ſome) which flowers grow in the beſt and chief of the Valleys, as if it had been ſaid,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42788:149"/>
The glory of theſe ten Tribes is but like the beauty of thoſe flowers, which are in thoſe rich Valleys wherein they dwell. But according to our Tranſlation, this relative (which) muſt needs be referred to the perſons againſt whom this woe is denounced, <hi>which are on the head of the fat Valleys of them that are overcome with wine,</hi> or, as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>broken with wine,</hi> (to wit, as being by their exceſſive drinking, becomes Fools and ſtupid, and made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for any thing) that is, <hi>which Drunkards of Ephraim</hi> dwell in the chief and principal part of the Vale of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for the main body of the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be ſpoken of as a Valley, becauſe it lay beneath Mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and was a very fat and fruitful Country) or which abide in the Mountain of <hi>Samaria;</hi> for <hi>Samaria</hi> was built indeed on a Hill in thoſe fat Valleys, See the Note 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.14. And ſo the Prophet may hereby ſeem to ſtrike principally at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Ones, that had their reſidence in the Court and Royal City of <hi>Samaria.</hi> However, thoſe words, <hi>on the Head of the fat Vallies,</hi> are certainly uſed with reſpect to thoſe in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>Wo to the crown of pride,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and ſtrong one,</hi> &amp;c.] to wit, <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> the Aſſyrian, <hi>which as a tempeſt of Hail and a deſtroying ſtorm, as a floud of mighty waters overflowing, ſhall caſt down to the earth with the hand;</hi> that is, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and eaſily overthrow and deſtroy all the glory of <hi>Iſrael, the fading flower,</hi> before mentioned (for with reſpect to that, he compares the Invaſion of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> to a tempeſt) even as a drunken man is eaſily thruſt down with the puſh of a hand; or, <hi>with the hand,</hi> that is, by main might, with unreſiſtable force and violence. And indeed the ſubduing and deſtroying of <hi>Samaria</hi> and the ten Tribes, was effected with great ſpeed and violence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, ſhall be trodden under foot]</hi> that is, even this crown on the head ſhall with all poſſible ſcorn and contempt be trampled under the feet of their proud enemies. But ſee the Note before ver. 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley, ſhall be a fading flower,</hi> &amp;c.] See again the Note above ver. 1. <hi>and as the haſty fruit before the Summer;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, rathe ripe fruits, which is commonly, as we uſe to ſay, ſoon ripe and ſoon rotten, and therefore not kept long for ſtore, but preſently ſpent; or rather, as the early and firſt ripe fruit, which for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of it, becauſe by many it is much longed for, and earneſtly deſired, is commonly gathered betimes, and eaten greedily, many times before it be thoroughly mellow: whence is the expreſſion, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.1. <hi>My ſoul deſired the firſt ripe fruit;</hi> for that this is meant, appears by the following words, <hi>which when he that looketh upon it, ſeeth it, while it is yet in his hand, he eateth it up;</hi> that is, as ſoon as ever he ſpieth it, he preſently plucks it, and never lays it by, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately eats it up. And all this is to ſet forth how ſoon the ten Tribes ſhould be ripe for ruine; and how eaſily, with what eagerneſs, delight, and ſpeed the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>In that day,</hi> &amp;c.] to wit, When the ten Tribes ſhall be thus deſtroyed, <hi>ſhall the Lord of Hoſts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty unto the reſidue of his people;</hi> that is, He will be an exceeding great ornament and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> This is oppoſed to that which he had ſaid
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42788:150"/>
of the ten Tribes, ver. 1. <hi>Wo to the crown of pride,</hi> &amp;c. And the meaning is, that whereas Gods People might ſeem to be brought to a very low and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, when ten of their Tribes ſhould be deſtroyed, as is aforeſaid, God would be a ſufficient honour and glory to the poor remnant of his People in the two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> to wit, by his ſaving them from being deſtroyed with the other, and continuing them to be his Church and People, by that miraculous deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, when <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> ſhould ſeek likewiſe to ſubdue them, and by a happy re-eſtabliſhment of his Church under <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> which laſt is farther ſet forth in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And for a ſpirit of judgment,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet ſets forth in part the means whereby God would make the ſtate of <hi>Judah</hi> ſo eminently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and glorious, both in peace and war. <hi>And for a Spirit of judgment to him that ſitteth in judgment,</hi> that is, God will give their Kings, and other ſubordinate Judges, that ſit in the ſeat of juſtice, a Spirit of juſtice, an ability to judge rightly of the cauſes that are brought before them; <hi>and ſtrength to them that turn the battel to the gate;</hi> that is, and ſo likewiſe courage and ſtrength to them that go out to withſtand an invading enemy, ſo that they ſhall not only vanquiſh them, and drive them back, but alſo purſue them to the very gates of their Cities and other ſtrong holds, whither they ſhall flee to ſhelter themſelves, and there block them up, and it may be take their places of defence, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.8. And all this now is added for the comfort of the faithful amongſt the Jews, that they might not be overwhelmed with grief and fear, when they ſhould ſee their brethren in the neighbour kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as had been now foretold, wholly deſtroyed and carried away Captives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>But they alſo have erred through wine, and through ſtrong dring are out of the way,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though they have had ſo fair a warning by the deſtruction of the ten tribes; though Gods Mercy was ſo wonderful in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them from being over-run by the ſame overbearing enemies that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and though they had Gods Word and Worſhip continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which the other tribes had not; yet even they of <hi>Judah</hi> alſo (the Prophet ſpeaks it with a kind of Admiration) have trod in the ſame ſteps of wickedneſs, wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had gone before them; for this may be underſtood either of their brutiſh ſtupidity, by reaſon whereof they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves like ſo many drunken men void of underſtanding; or rather literally of the ſin of drunkenneſs it ſelf; ſee the Note above, ver. 1. <hi>The Prieſt and the Prophet</hi> (to wit, their falſe Prophets) <hi>have erred through ſtrong drink,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.1. <hi>They are ſwallowed up of wine,</hi> that is, as we uſe to ſay, they are drowned in drink; they have ſwallowed up wine ſo long, that at laſt they themſelves are ſwallowed up of wine, and ceaſe to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures; <hi>they are out of the way through ſtrong drink, they err in viſion, they ſtumble in judgment;</hi> the firſt is meant principally of their Prophets, and the ſecond of the their Prieſts, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9. And the Note, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For all Tables are full of vomit and filthineſs, ſo that there is no place clean.]</hi> That is, they ſpue on their very Tables; and all places where they ſit, and revel together, are beſpitted and beſpawled, and every way defiled; for the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42788:150"/>
word here tranſlated <hi>filthineſs,</hi> doth properly ſignify or dure or dung, ſo that all tends to ſhew into what a height of exceſs and impudency they were grown in regard of this ſin.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Whom ſhall be teach Knowledge? and whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine?</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, God: of whom mention was made before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.6. <hi>The Lord of hoſts ſhall be for a Crown of Glory, and for adiadem of beauty unto the reſidue of his People,</hi> &amp;c. But rather this is ſpoken indefinitely, and is add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as another ſad effect of their exceſs and ſenſuality; as if the Prophet had ſaid, the generality of the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> both Prieſts, and Prophets, and People, being become ſuch drunken ſots, ſo ſtupid and deſperately wicked, how can any man hope, by, teaching them to do any good upon them? <hi>them that are wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the milk, and drawn from the breaſts,</hi> as if he had ſaid, one had as good undertake to teach Children a while a go weaned from the breaſt, as to teach ſuch a blockiſh and ſelf-willed People as theſe are become.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For precept muſt be upon precept, percept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little.]</hi> That is, As it is with ſuch young Children, that are taught to read, or to write; they muſt have the ſame directions and leſſons repeated again and again, and one day after another; if they be taught to read, they muſt be taught letter by letter, and line by line, a little at one time, and a little at another, and the ſame thing over and over many and many times; and if they be taught to write, the Maſter muſt lead their hand letter by letter, and line by line, and they muſt write over the ſame Copy many times, and yet when they have thus wearied their Teachers, it is little or nothing which they learn; ſo it is with this People, what ever courſe be taken with them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diligence is uſed in teaching them, all will be to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>For with ſtammering lips, and another tongue will he ſpeak to this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.]</hi> This is otherwiſe read by ſome, as it is in the margin, <hi>For with ſtammering lips and another tongue he hath ſpoken to this People;</hi> and they make the meaning of the words to be either, 1. that God by his Prophets had ſpoken to them, as Mothers and Nurſes uſe to ſpeak to their little Children (for ſtill, ſay they, the Prophet goeth on in the ſimilitude uſed in the foregoing verſes) that is, he had made known his will to them in a plain and familier manner, ſtooping to their Capacity, even as Mothers and Nurſes are wont to uſe new deviſed words, moſt eaſy to be pronounced, and to ſpeak in a kind of ſtammering imperfect way, as Children uſe to ſpeak, that they may the better teach their Children to ſpeak, and that they may the better be underſtood by them. Or, 2ly, that ſuch was theſottiſhneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that in all that God had ſpoken to them, he had been to them as one that ſtutters or ſtammers, or as an outlandiſh man, that ſpeaks in an unknown Tongue, (neither of which are underſtood by thoſe that hear them) meaning, that they were ſtupid and brutiſh, and regarded his word no more than if they had not underſtood one word of what was ſpoken to them. Or, 3ly, that by way of puniſhing them for their wickedneſs, he had cauſed their land to be invaded by nations whoſe language they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not. But now reading it as it is in our Traſlation, as a commination of what God would do, <hi>for with ſtammering lips, and another tongue will he ſpeak to this People,</hi> the meaning muſt needs be, either, that ſince the word that God
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42788:151"/>
had ſpoken to them by his Prophets, had done no more good upon them, by reaſon of their ſtupidity, than if one ſhould undertake to teach new-weaned Children, therefore the Lord would take another courſe with them, and ſpeak to them in a rougher way, namely, by bringing in the <hi>Babylonians</hi> upon them, a nation whoſe language they ſhould not underſtand, as was long ſince threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.49. Or, 2ly, that he would give them over to ſuch a Spirit of ſtupidity, that no inſtruction ſhould for the time to come do any good upon them. And indeed either of theſe may well agree with that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.21. (where he ſeems to cite this place) <hi>In the Law it is written,</hi> that is, in the Old Teſtament, <hi>With men of other Tongues and other Lips will I ſpeak unto this People, and yet for all that will they not hear me;</hi> for the aim of the Apoſtle there being to diſſuade them from an inordinate deſire of hearing thoſe that had the gift of Tongues, rather than thoſe that Prophecied, yea even then, when there was none that did interpret what they ſpake; he alledgeth this place to prove, that herein they did ambitiouſly affect that, which God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a curſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>To whom he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added farther to ſet forth how the Word of God had been to them without all good effect, as if God had ſpoken to them in a language they did not underſtand; or elſe to ſhew why God would ſpeak to them <hi>with ſtammering Lips and with another Tongue,</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were obſtinate, and would not be inſtructed. <hi>To whom he ſaid,</hi> that is, to which ſtupid People, that regarded not the inſtructions and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they enjoyed, the Lord ſaid, to wit, by his Prophets, <hi>This is the reſt wherewith ye may cauſe the weary to reſt; and this is the refreſhing.</hi> That is, this which I require of you, that you ſhould obey the word of my Prophets, is the only means whereby you may procure reſt and refreſhing for your ſelves, your Country and People, from thoſe many miſeries, troubles and calamities wherewith you have been wearied a long time together; <hi>Yet they would not hear,</hi> that is, though the Lord ſhewed them plainly the way to reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they would not hearken to it: Whereby is alſo implied, that their ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in being like little Children that could not be taught, proceeded from their obſtinacy; it was from meer wilfulneſs and ſtubborneſs that they were ſo ignorant.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay many Expoſitors, inſtead of obeying the words of the Prophets, they mocked at their words, repeating thoſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. in a flouting way, <hi>Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line,</hi> &amp;c. As if they ſhould have ſaid, Our Prophets deal with us as with young Children, we muſt have precept upon precept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed that which follows, ver. 14. <hi>Wherefore hear the word of the Lord ye ſcornful men,</hi> ſeems to favour this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But I rather think that the Prophets intention in theſe words was to ſhew, that after God had ſo plainly made known his will to them, and taught them what might have been for their peace and reſt, yet ſtill they were as dull as ever, Gods Word was ſtill to them only as an empty ſound ſtriking their ears; they were ſtill as unteachable as new-weaned Children: <hi>That they might go and fall backwards, and be broken, and ſnared, and taken.</hi> That ſo (through
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42788:151"/>
the juſt Judgment of God upon them) by this their ſtupidity they might come to fall and be ruined under thoſe Judgments which God had threatned againſt them. It is probable that this expreſſion of their falling, may be uſed with reference to that ſin of drunkenneſs wherewith he had charged them, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And that it is particularly ſaid, <hi>That they might fall backward;</hi> Either becauſe that way of falling is moſt dangerous; or to imply that their not minding Gods Prophets would bring them to fall under thoſe Judgments, which, though foretold, they would not foreſee. And ſo likewiſe by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>broken,</hi> the utter cutting off ſome may be intended; and by their being <hi>ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken,</hi> the Captivity of others.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye ſcornful men, that rule this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which is in Jeruſalem.]</hi> This is meant of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he calls them <hi>this People which is in Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe thither they uſed to reſort to Worſhip God, as his People; and to imply, that their ſcorning was the greater ſin, becauſe they pretended to be Gods peculiar People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Becauſe ye have ſaid, We have made a covenant with Death, and with Hell are we at agrement,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, becauſe you think your ſelves ſo ſecure, as if ye had made a Covenant with Death and Hell. Or, becauſe you run on ſo boldly in your wicked ways, ſlighting the vengeance of God, denounced againſt you, that it is all one in effect, as if you ſhould openly ſay, We are not frighted with your threatnings of Death and Hell; We have made a Covenant with them both, and therefore are ſure they will do us no hurt. This I conceive the Prophet intended by theſe words. Yet it may well be, that the wicked wretches of thoſe times did uſe to ſay thus to the Prophets, not as thinking they could make an agreement with Hell and Death, but only in a way of deriſion; as if they ſhould have ſaid, Think not to ſcare us with the threatnings of Death and Hell; alas, we have made a ſtrict league of friendſhip with Death, and with Hell or the grave, and therefore may well be fearleſs in regard of them both. Yea, ſome think, that by ſaying they had made a Covenant with Death and the Grave, they might intend that Death and the Grave would do them good, rather than hurt, namely becauſe they would take them out of harms way, before thoſe evils which the Prophets threatned were like to come upon them; <hi>when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through</hi> (to wit, which you the Prophets tell us is coming upon the land) <hi>it ſhall not come near us.</hi> And hereby might be intended, either the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> invaſion, whereby the ten Tribes were utterly ruined (and if this be intended, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an exceeding height of preſumptuous ſecurity in theſe men, that when they ſaw the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over-run thereby, yet could promiſe themſelves, that it ſhould not reach them) or elſe that of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which was often before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand threatned by the Prophets. <hi>For we have made lies our refuge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der falſhood have we hid our ſelves:</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid; Thoſe things which you call lyes and falſhood, things that will ſurely deceive us, we doubt not will prove a ſufficient refuge and ſhelter to us. Add hereby they might mean either, 1. their falſe gods, on whoſe help they much relyed, though the Prophets often cried out againſt them as lying vanities, as Chap. 44.20. <hi>A deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his Soul, nor ſay, Is
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42788:152"/>
there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> Or, 2ly, the reſpect which in ſome things they pretended to have to Gods law, and to his ſervice and worſhip in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which was indeed no better than meer hypocriſy and a lye. Or, 3ly, their ſubtil ſhifts, their crafty diſſembling, and treacherous compliance with the enemy, wherewith they might vainly hope to ſecure themſelves, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver became of others. Or, 4ly, the outward means they had for their defence, and whereby they did fooliſhly hope to ſafeguard themſelves, as their great riches gotten by lies and falſhood, their leagues with foreign Princes, and the wiſe Councels and Contrivements wherewith they had plotted to ſtrengthen themſelves againſt any invaſion. It cannot be thought that any men would ſay theſe very words, <hi>For we have made lies our refuge,</hi> &amp;c. unleſs it were in a way of flouting thoſe to whom they ſpake it: Only hereby the Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to turn them from their folly in truſting to thoſe things that would certainly deceive them, and prove no better than <hi>lies and falſhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing verſe laid down the cauſe of Gods high diſpleaſure againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> namely, becauſe they did ſo obſtinately and ſecurely deſpiſe and deride all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gods Prophets, glorying in their ſafe condition, as if there were no fear of any evil that ſhould come upon them; <hi>Becauſe ye have ſaid, We have made a covenant with death,</hi> &amp;c. that which one would think ſhould next follow, ſhould be the making known, how ſeverely God would proceed againſt them to deſtroy them. And this indeed is added in the following verſe. Only firſt, the Lord premiſeth this glorious promiſe concerning the Meſſiah, <hi>Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a ſtone,</hi> &amp;c. and that 1. hereby to chear up the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amongſt them againſt the wrath which was coming upon their State and people, by putting them in mind of that foundation-ſtone which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the ſupport and preſervation of his Church, on whom whilſt they relied by Faith, they ſhould be ſure to be upheld and ſecured in the midſt of all thoſe grievous judgments that ſhould come upon that Nation. And 2. to hint unto thoſe prophane wretches that were ſo confident, that no evil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Prophets ſhould come upon them; that he had indeed provided a Rock in <hi>Zion,</hi> on whom relying, they might have aſſured themſelves of all peace and ſafety; but becauſe they had deſpiſed him, and run on in ways of rebellion and wickedneſs, all theſe vain ſtays whereon they relied with ſo much confidence, would ſurely deceive them; <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation a ſtone;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. <hi>a tried ſtone;</hi> that is, a ſure Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, on whom poor ſinners may ſafely rely; <hi>a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation,</hi> according to that, <hi>Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16.18. <hi>he that believeth, ſhall not make haſte;</hi> that is, they that believe this promiſe, and do by faith reſt upon this rock, to wit, God in Chriſt, will wait patiently upon God for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, both as to the coming of this promiſed Meſſiah, and as to the deliverances expected from him; though the promiſed mercy ſhould be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and delayed for a time, yet they will not be impatient, and grudg that it is not done, nor uſe any unlawful means to help themſelves, but will contentedly wait, as being fully perſwaded, that in due time God will make good what he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42788:152"/>
hath promiſed. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. the Apoſtle following the Septuagint, ſeems to cite this place otherwiſe than we find it here in the Prophet, <hi>As it is written, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling-ſtone, and rock of offence: and whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> But this is the ſame in effect; and it is uſual with the Apoſtle in citing places out of the Old Teſtament, not ſo much to regard the words as the matter; becauſe they that make haſte, and will not wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the accompliſhment of Gods promiſe, are ſure to miſcarry, and ſo in the concluſion to be aſhamed of their folly; whereas thoſe that wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes, are ſure never to be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and ſo never to be aſhamed: therefore the Apoſtle inſtead of theſe words, <hi>ſhall not make haſte,</hi> uſeth the ſame in effect, <hi>ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> And beſides, that which others anſwer, is very probable, to wit, that as the Apoſtle in the firſt words of that place, <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling-ſtone, and rock of offence,</hi> doth joyn with the words here, another place of our Prophet, namely, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.14. ſo in the latter clauſe alſo, with the words here, he ſeems to take in that alſo, Chap. 49.23. <hi>they ſhall not be aſhamed that wait for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Judgment alſo will I lay to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.13. God expreſſeth himſelf here in terms ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the figurative expreſſion he had uſed in the foregoing verſe, of laying a ſtone to be a ſure foundation for his Church; and the meaning ſeems to be, That having laid ſuch a ſure foundation, as Chriſt was, for the ſafety and peace of thoſe that would believe in him, he would proceed in judging his people with all judgment and righteouſneſs, in as exact and preciſe a manner, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters and Maſons are wont to do, when they carry on their work by line and level; againſt the wicked he would proceed with all juſt ſeverity, puniſhing them exactly according to their ſins, though withal he would be very wary to preſerve his faithful ones, and to carry on the building up and reforming of his Church, which a company of wicked wretches had brought into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>and the hail</hi> (he alludes to that mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>ſhall ſweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the refuge of lies;</hi> that is, All your vain hopes, and all things whereon you vainly grounded ſuch great hopes; <hi>and the waters ſhall overflow the hiding place,</hi> that is, Your hopes of hiding your ſelves from the Judgments that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall not ſecure you. Both Expreſſions are uſed with reference to that vaunting ſpeech of theirs, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>We have made lies our refuge, and under falſhood have we hid our ſelves.</hi> And the judgment here intended, whereby this ſhould be done, may be the great havock that was made amongſt them by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> if not, which ſome rather think, their far geater Deſtruction and Deſolation by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And your Covenant with death ſhall be diſannulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not ſtand,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken by way of deriding that ſcornful ſpeech of theirs, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>We have made a covenant with death,</hi> &amp;c. and implies both that their preſent ſecurity ſhould be turned into extream dread and terror; and that notwithſtanding all their vain confidence, they ſhould certainly be deſtroyed; <hi>when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, then ye ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42788:153"/>
down by it;</hi> that is, it ſhall not paſs away ſo ſuddenly, but that ye ſhall be overborn and deſtroyed by it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>From the time it that goeth forth, it ſhall take you,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When it once begins to break in upon you, it ſhall not ſtay till it hath ſurprized you. Whereas they had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>When the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come unto us</hi> (for which ſee the Note there) to this the Lord by the Prophet here anſwers, That they did but in vain flatter themſelves, it ſhould certainly ſeize upon them; <hi>for morning by morning ſhall it paſs over, by day and by night,</hi> that is, It ſhall come ſpeedily, ſuddenly, and unexpectedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, when you think leaſt of it (even as a man that is ſurprized early in a morning, when he is as yet ſleeping in his bed) and being come, it ſhall continue long upon you, purſuing you inceſſantly, not giving you any reſt, either by day or by night; <hi>and it ſhall be a vexation only to underſtand the report,</hi> that is, The alone fame and report of the enemies approach, ſhall be a ſore terror and vexation to you. Some, I know, underſtand it thus, That even to thoſe that felt no part of theſe miſeries, but only heard of them, it ſhould be a vexation. And again others by <hi>the report,</hi> do underſtand the doctrine of Gods Prophets, according to that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> and ſo reading the words as they are rendred in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>and it ſhall be a vexation only, when he ſhall make you to underſtand doctrine;</hi> they would have the meaning to be this; That when the miſeries now foretold, were come upon them, thereby God would bring them to underſtand that doctrine which now they would not underſtand, the truth of what the Prophets foretold, and the folly, of their preſent ſecurity; only indeed it would then be too late: their underſtanding this then, would be only for their greater vexation, not for their converſion. But the firſt Expoſition is, I conceive, the beſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>For the bed is ſhorter than that a man can ſtretch himſelf on it,</hi> &amp;c.] This proverbial ſpeech may imply, 1. the great penury and ſtreights they ſhould be brought into, when thoſe miſeries came upon them which the Prophet had now foretold; that they ſhould be in continual diſtreſs, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to turn themſelves, nor able any way to eaſe or relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it is with a man that lying on a bed that is too ſhort for him, muſt needs be as in Little-eaſe, and as it were cripled thereby. And 2ly, the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of thoſe lying vanities, in the confidence whereof they were ſo ſecure, for the affording of them any eaſe or comfort; for which, ſee the Note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And the like may be ſaid of the following clauſe, <hi>and the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrower than that he can wrap himſelf in it;</hi> for this may imply alſo the comfortleſs condition whereinto they ſhould be brought; and withall, what poor things they would all prove, for the covering and ſheltering of them from the ſtorms that were coming upon them, whereon they grounded all their hopes. And it may well be alſo, that in theſe Expreſſions the Prophet might covertly ſtrike at the luxury of thoſe men that did thus ſcornfully ſlight and deride the threatnings of Gods Prophets, who lived in all eaſe and jollity, ſtretching themſelves on their rich beds, that were furniſhed with rich and coſtly coverlets, ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:42788:153"/>Ver. 21. <hi>For the Lord ſhall riſe up, as in mount Perazim,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.20. <hi>He ſhall be wroth, as in the valley of Gibeon;</hi> to wit, When <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſlew the <hi>Canaanites</hi> there, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.10. at which time it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. That God ſlew them with hail-ſtones from Heaven; in regard whereof, this ſtory ſuits the better with that ſtorm of hail threatned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. The drift of this threatning is to ſhew, That God would now proceed with the <hi>Jews</hi> that profeſſed themſelves his people, but were indeed his real enemies, no otherwiſe than he had formerly proceeded in their defence againſt the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> both his and their profeſſed enemies. And this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls <hi>his ſtrange work,</hi> and <hi>his ſtrange act; that he may do his work, his ſtrange work; and bring to paſs his act, his ſtrange act;</hi> either 1. as ſome ſay, becauſe the work of deſtroying men, is, as it were, ſtrange to God, who is rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew mercy, and to pardon, than to puniſh, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Or, 2ly. becauſe Gods proceeding in a way of deſtroying his people, was ſtrange and unuſual, that God ſhould fight againſt thoſe, in defence of whom he was wont to fight againſt their enemies, this was ſtrange and wonderful. As a Fathers whipping of his Child, whom he ſo dearly loves, is a ſtrange work; ſo for God to deſtroy his peculiar people, to whom he had been formerly ſo good and gracious, was very ſtrange. Or, 3ly. becauſe the Judgment he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended now to bring upon them, was extraordinary and unwonted, ſtrange, wonderful and dreadful, above what in his greateſt ſeverity he had formerly done to them. For though he had often brought ſore Judgments upon them in their own land, yet he had never cauſed their City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple therein, to be burnt, and the people to be generally carried away captives into ſtrange Countries, as he meant now to do.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Now therefore be ye not mockers,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Mock not at the threatnings of Gods Prophets, as you have done; ſee the Notes before, ver. 13. and 15. <hi>leſt your bands be made ſtrong;</hi> that is, leſt for this God ſhould make the judgments he brings upon you the ſorer, and of the longer continuance; from which otherwiſe, if you would have repented, you might have been looſed and freed. Puniſhments inflicted upon men for ſin, are called <hi>bands,</hi> becauſe they are painful to fleſh and blood, and do reſtrain and bind up men from living as they liſt themſelves. And as beaſts of prey, being taken in ſnares, are the faſter intangled and bound, the more they ſtruggle and ſtrive to get away; ſo the more wicked men do ſtrive againſt God, when he begins to contend with them, the heavier the judgments uſually are which he pours forth upon them: <hi>for I have heard from the Lord God of Hoſts a conſumption even determined upon the whole earth;</hi> that is, the whole land of <hi>Judea,</hi> to wit, except ye repent. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Give ye ear and hear my voice; hearken and hear my ſpeech.]</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, I will convince you by an unanſwerable argument, taken from that which you ſee commonly done amongſt men, that you have no cauſe to queſtion, but that God will at laſt certainly do what he hath threatned by his Prophets; and that you do fooliſhly flatter your ſelves with hopes that you ſhall always go unpuniſhed, becauſe he hath ſpared you ſo long; and therefore attend diligently to what I ſhall now ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42788:154"/>Ver. 24. <hi>Doth the plowman plow all day to ſow?</hi> &amp;c.] The drift of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to the end of the Chapter, is to ſhew, that if the Husbandman, by the wiſdom wherewith God hath endewed him, doth not ſpend all his time in plowing and harrowing his ground, never going any further (which would be meer loſt labour), but when he hath done that, then he ſoweth his ſeveral ſeeds in the grounds thus prepared by plowing and harrowing, and that with great wiſdom, not confuſedly throwing in all together, but ſowing them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in ſeveral grounds, allotting to each that ſeed which he knows the ſoil is fitteſt for, and which is moſt likely to thrive in it, and diſperſing it in ſuch quantities as may beſt promote the growth of it; and when he hath done that, then he proceeds orderly in the following works of his Husbandry, as weeding and reaping his Corn when it is harveſt, and ſuch like, till at laſt he comes to ſeparate his Corn from the Straw and Chaff, which he doth alſo with much prudence in different ways, according to the ſtrength or tenderneſs of the grain; much more may any rational man think, that God, the fountain of all wiſdom, and by whom therefore the Husbandman is enabled to carry on his work ſo wiſely, will order the diſpenſation of his providence towards his people (his ſpiritual Husbandry) with greater wiſdom; that he will not be always plowing and harrowing you by the Miniſtry of his Prophets, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you, and denouncing his judgments againſt you, thereby to break your hearts, and to fit you to receive the word and inſtruction of his ſervants, but that at laſt he will come to the executing of thoſe judgments upon you, of which he hath often forewarned you, beating you, and threſhing you by enemies, he will bring upon you, though differently, according to the different degrees of your ſins. This I conceive is in general the drift of this whole paſſage. And accordingly he begins, firſt with the Husbandman's plowing and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Doth the plowman plow all day to ſow?</hi> that is, will he be continually plowing it, that it may be fit to receive the ſeed? <hi>doth he open and break the clods of his ground,</hi> to wit, continually? will he be always breaking the clods with a Mallet, or with a Harrow, and never proceed any further? As if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſaid, Doubtleſs he will not do ſo.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>When he hath made plain the face thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When he hath laid the land even, by breaking the greater clods, he doth not ſtay there, but then <hi>doth he not caſt abroad the fitches, and ſcatter the cummin, and caſt in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rie</hi> (or <hi>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some indeed read the laſt words as they are in the margin, <hi>the wheat in the principal place, and the barley in the appointed place:</hi> But the difference betwixt theſe two Tranſlations is not great; they both imply the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>For his God doth inſtruct him,</hi> &amp;c.] Some read this as it is in the margin, <hi>And he bindeth it in ſuch ſort as his God doth teach him;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they underſtand it as another expreſſion, whereby the Husbandman's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſet forth in the ordering of Husbandry; to wit, that having thus prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſown his ſeveral ſeeds, afterward when Harveſt comes, having cut it down, he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42788:154"/>
binds it up in ſheaves and bundles, that he may carry it and houſe it, and in due time threſh it and winnow it out (And ſome alſo conceive, that this is ſpoken with reference to what was ſaid before, ver. 22. <hi>be ye not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong).</hi> But according to our Tranſlation, <hi>for his God doth inſtruct him to diſcretion, and doth teach him;</hi> the drift of the words is clearly to ſhew, that it is God that gives this wiſdom to the Husbandman, whereby he is enabled to order all his affairs ſo prudently, as is here both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and afterward related; and from hence to imply, that therefore it might well be concluded, that God, the fountain of all wiſdom, would not, nor could not fail, to order all the diſpenſations of his providence towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with infinite wiſdom. But however, obſervable it is, that in ſetting down this, the Prophet uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>his God doth inſtruct him.</hi> God is no leſs the Plowmans God, than the God of Nobles and Princes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>For the fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtrument; neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin,</hi> &amp;c.] As if it had been ſaid, As the Husbandman ſheweth much wiſdom in the ſowing his ſeed, as is before ſaid, ver. 25. ſo alſo in the beating out of his grain, when it is cut down; to wit, in that he doth not beat out the tenderer ſeeds, <hi>the fitches</hi> and <hi>the cummin,</hi> as he doth the harder corn, the wheat, and barley, and rie, which was uſually in thoſe Countries done by cart-wheels, or ſleds (the <hi>threſhing inſtrument</hi> haply here intended) that were drawn over them, or by the Hoofs of their Horſes or Oxen; ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. <hi>but the fitches are beaten out with a ſtaff, and the cummin with a rod.</hi> And this is added to imply, that God doth not puniſh all men in a like manner for their ſins, but differently, according to the different quality of the offender, or of their offences: Some he afflicts more gently, beating them as with a rod; upon ſome he brings more tearing judgments, as he finds their ſins greater, and their hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>Bread-corn is bruiſed,</hi> &amp;c.] I confeſs I cannot ſee how this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this firſt branch of the verſe can ſtand with the following words, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not ever be threſhing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruiſe it with his horſe-men.</hi> For what is this leſs than to make the laſt words contradict the firſt; Bread-corn is bruiſed by the Husbandman, becauſe he will not ever be bruiſing it? Some to avoid this, underſtand the firſt words, of bruiſing the bread-corn, wheat, and rie, and barley, by grinding it in the mill; and ſo they underſtand this verſe thus, that <hi>bread-corn is bruiſed,</hi> to wit, by grinding it in the mill, becauſe the Husbandman would not be ever threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or drawing cart-wheels or ſleds over it, or treading it out with the feet of Horſes or Oxen, ſeeing this would quite mar it, and make it good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But it ſeems not probable, that the Prophet is ſpeaking here, of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corn in the mill. I rather therefore think, that the negative expreſſed in the former verſe, is here again to be underſtood (as it is very well obſerved in the large Annotations of our Divines on this place), as if it had been expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus, <hi>As the fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n;</hi> ſo (by the ſame wiſe care of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman) neither is the bread-corn quite bruiſed and beaten, as it were to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42788:155"/>
duſt, though more violent ways are uſed to beat out that from the ſtraw and chaff; and that 1. becauſe the Husbandman will not be always threſhing it, nor will over-long ſuffer the cart-wheels to be drawn over it, nor the beaſts to be trampling upon it. And 2. becauſe he is careful, that neither by the cart-wheel or ſled drawn over it, or <hi>the horſe-men</hi> (to wit, the men that lead, or ride upon the Horſes that draw the carts or ſleds), it ſhall be quite battered and ſpoiled with the cruſhing and bruiſing of it. Thus I conceive this paſſage may moſt fitly be expounded: For clearly the drift of the Prophet is to ſhew, that as the Husbandman, even when he uſeth rougher means to beat out the hard grain, is however careful, not to do it ſo inceſſantly, or in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to mar and ſpoil his corn thereby; ſo neither will God, even when he puniſheth his people more ſeverely, contend with them for ever, or proceed to the utter deſtroying of them; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>This alſo cometh from the Lord of hosts,</hi> &amp;c.] Some of our beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors refer the word <hi>(This)</hi> here, to the deſtruction threatned above, ver. 22. and ſo would have this to be the concluſion and explanation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſimilitude; as if the Prophet had ſaid, As the Husbandmans diſcreet ordering his affairs from the beginning to the end, in plowing, ſowing, and beating out his grain, is from God, who giveth him this wiſdom; ſo is the ruin and deſtruction which I have told you ſhall come upon you from the Lord, who doth with infinite wiſdom all things that he doth in the world. But more probably, methinks, it ſeems to have reference to the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately foregoing, ver. 28. and ſo the meaning to be this, That as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's skill in ordering his ſeed (whereof mention was made before, ver. 24, 25.) ſo <hi>this alſo</hi> of his beating out his grain, as is before deſcribed, is from God. But however, that which is principally intended is, as is before noted, that if the Husbandman, by the wiſdom wherewith God hath endued him, doth thus wiſely and prudently beat out his ſeveral grain, much more will the only wiſe God himſelf with infinite wiſdom, order thoſe judgments which he brings upon his people. And thereupon are thoſe words added in the cloſe of this ſimilitude, <hi>which is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and that to imply, amongſt other things, the wonderful wiſdom of God, in that whilſt he deſtroyed the wicked amongſt them, yet he would at the ſame time be ſo careful to preſerve a holy remnant; and in that whilſt he ſeemed to proceed againſt his people with ſuch bitter hatred, yet all that he did to them, ſhould be done out of love, and with reſpect to their good and welfare.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO to Ariel,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſeems to be another Prophecy, diſtinct from that which went before, and directed particularly againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> though indeed, by conſequence, in the evils denounced againſt her, the whole land of <hi>Judah</hi> was deeply concerned. It may be read as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>Oh Ariel, Ariel,</hi> as ſpoken by way of lamentation, the word <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> being twice repeated to expreſs the more grief, as in the like mournful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of our Saviours over <hi>Jeruſalem, Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, thou that killeſt the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. But the moſt Interpreters render it as it is in our Bibles, <hi>Wo to Ariel, to Ariel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ariel</hi> is by interpretation, a mighty Lion, or, as it is in the margin, <hi>the lion of God;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.16. Many of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hold, that it is the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> againſt which this wo is particularly denounced; and that the Temple was called <hi>Ariel,</hi> the Lion of God, becauſe the figure of the Temple did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſemble that of a Lion, being broad before, and narrow behind. Others ſay, it is the Altar in the Temple, that is here called <hi>Ariel:</hi> And indeed we find in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15. that the Altar of burnt offerings, is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called <hi>Ariel;</hi> and that by the common conſent of moſt Expoſitors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Altar that was conſecrated to God, ſeemed as a Lion to devour the bodies of thoſe beaſts that were daily ſacrificed thereon. But I rather think with others, that it is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is here termed <hi>Ariel;</hi> and that the following words are added, to make known what the Prophet intended by <hi>Ariel; Wo to Ariel, to Ariel, the City where David dwelt.</hi> And though there are ſeveral Reaſons given by Expoſitors, why <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſo called, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had been fierce againſt God, and againſt his Prophets and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom ſhe had cruelly ſlain, according to that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Mine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is unto me as a lion in the foreſt, it crieth out againſt me;</hi> or becauſe it was a very ſtrong City, and by the valour of her inhabitants, had made great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock amongſt the Neighbour-Nations; yet I rather think, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is here ſo called, with reſpect to the Temple and Altar therein (and ſo the <hi>wo</hi> is denounced againſt all three together), and that purpoſely to imply, that though they looked upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a ſtrong and invincible City, <hi>the lion of God,</hi> that need not fear any people, and that becauſe of the preſence of God amongſt them, as his peculiar covenant-people (whereof the Altar was a ſign) yet this ſhould no way ſecure them from the judgment now denounced againſt them. To which purpoſe thoſe words are added, <hi>the city where David dwelt:</hi> For this alſo is to imply, that though they gloried much in the promiſes that God had made, concerning the perpetuity of <hi>David</hi>'s King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42788:156"/>
yet all this would do them no good; even that which was the Roya City of that glorious King, being quite degenerate from what ſhe had been, ſhould now be laid in the duſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Add ye year to year: let them kill ſacrifices.]</hi> Some hold, that the Prophets inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe words, was to make known, that within a few years, or more particularly within two years, there ſhould be an end of their ſacrificing. But the words ſeem to be clearly an Ironical taunt; as if the Prophet had ſaid, Go on year after year, to keep your ſolemn feaſts, and in each of them to kill and offer up your appointed ſacrifices, and feed your ſelves with vain hopes, that thus year after year ye ſhall ſtill continue to do: alas! all this will do no good; and that becauſe God abhors your ſacrifices, and will ſhortly put an end to them. And indeed, if this Prophecy were delivered, as ſome think it was, at ſome one of their feaſts, when they were very buſily intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſlaying and offering their ſacrifices, it muſt needs be the more ſeaſonable to diſcover the folly of the great confidence they had in that their hypocritical ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Yet I will diſtreſs Ariel,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though you go on in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal way of offering ſacrifices to me; and though for ſome years the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned may be deferred, yet at laſt (ſaith the Lord) I will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, by enemies I ſhall raiſe up againſt you, bring both your City and Temple into great ſtreights, <hi>and there ſhall be heavineſs and ſorrow;</hi> that is, inſtead of your preſent jollity, when you are offering up a multitude of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at your ſolemn feaſts, you ſhall then be ſorely over-preſſed with grief; <hi>and it ſhall be unto me as Ariel;</hi> ſee the foregoing Note. The meaning is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. That God would cauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be beſieged by enemies, even as Shepherds and Hunters are wont to gather together, and beſet ſome fierce raging Lion, that they may deſtroy him. Or 2. That ſhe ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with enemies, even as the Altar, called <hi>Ariel, Ezek.</hi> 43.15. uſed at their ſolemn feaſts to be compaſſed about on every ſide with beaſts, brought thither for ſacrifices, and with the people that brought them; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. Or 3. (which ſeems moſt probable) That the whole City ſhould be juſt like the Altar of burnt-offerings in the Temple, in that it ſhould be all on a light flame, and covered all over with gore blood; and in that the ſtreets thereof, and the Country round about ſhould lye full of ſlaughtered men and women (ſacrificed (as it were) to the ſatisfying of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice), even as the bodies of beaſts, ſlain for ſacrifices, uſed to lye ſcattered round about the Altar.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And I will camp againſt thee round about,</hi> &amp;c.] This I conceive, was meant of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> beſieging <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.1, 2, &amp;c. Yet I ſee not, but that it might alſo be ſpoken with reſpect to the ſame done afterward by the <hi>Romans:</hi> for our Saviour in foretelling that ſiege, may ſeem to allude to this place of the Prophet, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43. <hi>Thine enemies ſhall caſt a trench about thee, and compaſs thee round,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:42788:156"/>Ver. 4. <hi>And thou ſhalt be brought down,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou that doſt now ſo proudly exalt thy ſelf, ſhalt then be humbled and pulled down, <hi>and ſhalt ſpeak out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall be low out of the duſt;</hi> as Priſoners and Captives are wont to do, that lye proſtrate upon the ground before their enemies; or thoſe that are brought low to the very duſt, according to that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 47.1. <hi>Come down and ſit in the duſt, O Virgin daughter of Babylon, ſit on the ground:</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>and thy voice ſhall be as of one that hath a familiar ſpirit, out of the ground,</hi> &amp;c. for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.19. The meaning is, That the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had wont to talk ſo highly and proudly, and to roar like a Lion againſt God and his Servants, ſhould then ſpeak ſubmiſſively enough, as men over-whelmed with fear and grief are wont to do. Yea, ſome underſtand this, of their lying in duſt and aſhes, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy of God, when this Judgment, now denounced, was come upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Moreover, the multitude of thy ſtrangers ſhall be like ſmall duſt, and the multitude of the terrible ones ſhall be as chaff that paſſeth away,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the foreign Forces that ſhould invade <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo take it to be inſerted as a promiſe, for the comfort of the faithful amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> to wit, that when they ſhould be humbled (as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe), though their enemies ſhould be never ſo many, even like the ſmall duſt or chaff, yet like ſo much duſt or chaff, they ſhould ſoon be ſcattered and driven away. And ſome of theſe think this is meant of the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, that ſhould beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and others, of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> to wit, that when they had ruined <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even they ſhould within a while flee away, like ſo much duſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> chaff, before the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> But becauſe in the following Verſes the Prophet proceeds ſtill in a way of denouncing judgments againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I rather think with others, that this alſo is of the ſame tenor, and that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is here threatned, That her <hi>ſtrangers, and terrible ones,</hi> that is, her Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon-Souldiers, hired from other Nations, and thoſe Auxiliary Forces which ſhould from <hi>Egypt,</hi> or elſewhere, be ſent in to her aid, in whom ſhe gloried much, becauſe of their number and valour, ſhould be no defence at all to her, but ſhould be ſoon ſcattered and driven away, as the duſt and chaff is driven before the wind. And accordingly the laſt clauſe is to be underſtood likewiſe, <hi>yea, it ſhall be at an inſtant, ſuddenly;</hi> to wit, of the ſudden flight of thoſe foreign Forces, on whom they ſo much relied, rather than of the flight and diſperſion of their enemies, as they underſtand it, that take this to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as is before ſaid.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noiſe, with ſtorm and tempeſt, and the flame of devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire.]</hi> That is, God will execute his judgments upon thee, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with great terror and unreſiſtable violence, and that on a ſudden; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.13. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8, &amp;c. And this, I concieve, is meant of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> invading and ſtorming the City, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.14. and the expreſſion here uſed, ſeems to refer to what was ſaid in the foregoing
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42788:157"/>
verſe, that their Auxiliary Companies from foreign parts, ſhould be <hi>like ſmall duſt, and as chaff that paſſeth away;</hi> implying a reaſon why it muſt needs be ſo, to wit, becauſe God would break forth upon them, as with a terrible ſtorm, and devouring fire, before which they muſt needs be as ſo much <hi>duſt and chaff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the multitude of all the nations that fight againſt Ariel,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſee the Notes above, <hi>ver</hi> 1, 2. <hi>even all that fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her and her munition, and that diſtreſs her, ſhall be as a dream of a night-viſion.</hi> They that underſtand that which was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, inſerted for the comfort of the faithful amongſt Gods people, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpeedy ruin of the foreign enemies that ſhould come up and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> do accordingly alſo underſtand that which is ſaid here, either 1. of the diſappointment of their vain hopes, that they ſhould be <hi>as a dream of a night-viſion;</hi> that is, that it ſhould be with them, as it is with a man in a dream; they ſhould feed themſelves with vain hopes of taking the City, and of ſatisfying their rage in the deſtruction of the people, and their covetous deſires in their ſwallowing up all the wealth of the City; but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it ſhould be nothing ſo; they ſhould be fruſtrated of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is with a man that in a dream fancies he is eating, and filling his belly, but when he awakes, there is no ſuch matter. And this they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, was meant of the fruſtrating of the confident hopes of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and his <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> concerning their ſubduing the City <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Or 2. of the ſudden ſcattering and periſhing of all their Power and Forces, that they ſhould be <hi>as a dream of a night-viſion;</hi> to wit, in that, as a dream doth ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſh away out of the minds of men, ſo all their great Armies and Power, ſhould be ſuddenly waſted and conſumed, and brought to nothing, according to that of the Poet, <hi>par levibus ventis, voluerie<expan>

That the multitude of the Nations that fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould be <hi>as a dream of a night-viſion;</hi> to wit, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in that they ſhould be ſo ſecure and fearleſs, either of their invaſion, or of their prevailing over them when they invaded them, that it ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon them, and ſeem incredible to them, as if it were a dream, rather than really done: Or 2. rather, That the enemies that ſhould fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould be as men in a dream; to wit, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their inſatiable covetouſneſs and cruelty, as is explained in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>It ſhall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but he awaketh, and his ſoul is empty,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] That is, As a hungry man in his ſleep, when he dreams he is eating (as it is uſual with men in ſuch a condition to do), doth in an inſtant devour all which ſeems to be
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42788:157"/>
ſet before him; but when he is awakened, the man is as hungry as ever he was before; ſo ſhall it be with the enemies that fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> they ſhall greedily and ſpeedily devour <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but when they have ſo done, all they have done, ſhall be to them as if they had done nothing; they ſhall ſtill be as eager in their rage againſt you, as hungry and thirſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your blood and ruine, as they were at the firſt: When they have glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves (as one would think) with your blood, they ſhall be no more ſatisfied, than a dreamer is with what he eats or drinks in his dream. This Expoſition agrees beſt with that which went before. Yet ſome underſtand it of the diſappointment of the hopes of the enemies, concerning the ruin of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> for which ſee the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Stay your ſelves and wonder,</hi> &amp;c.] It is clear, that the Prophet doth here enter upon a very ſharp invective againſt the ſtrange ſecurity and ſtupidity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in their not minding the dreadful judgments which God had threatned to bring upon them. And becauſe the following words are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſome (as they are in the margin of our Bibles), <hi>take your pleaſure, and riot;</hi> therefore they hold, that the Prophet ſpeaks here to theſe ſecure wretches, <hi>Stay your ſelves, and wonder;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid (ſpeaking ironically), Perſiſt in your ſlighting what is ſpoken, hold off ſtill from hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my words, and only through Infidelity make a wonderment at what is threatned, as eſteeming them ſtrange, and altogether unlikely things; and thereupon <hi>take your pleaſure, and riot,</hi> as no way fearing that any ſuch evil will come upon you. Alas! all this proceeds from a ſenſleſs ſpirit; <hi>they are drunken,</hi> &amp;c. But I rather think, that this is ſpoken to the people in general, or to the faithful amongſt them; <hi>Stay your ſelves and wonder;</hi> that is, Stay long in your thoughts and meditations upon that which I have ſpoken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſore judgments that are coming upon you; or that which I ſay at preſent, concerning the ſecurity and ſtupidity of this people, and wonder and be aſtoniſhed at it; as if he ſhould have ſaid, The more you muſe of it, the more cauſe you will find to wonder at it; but that will be all you will be able to do; you will be able to do nothing for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your ſelves; <hi>cry ye out, and cry;</hi> to wit, for the ſad condition you are in, and the grievous miſeries that are coming upon you: <hi>they are drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but not with wine; they ſtagger, but not with ſtrong drink;</hi> that is, they are ſtupid, and ſenſleſs, and mad, and miſtake and miſcarry in all their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and courſes, like ſo many drunken men; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.14. and 24.20. and 28.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For the Lord hath poured upon you the ſpirit of deep ſleep, and hath cloſed your eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Lord, for your obſtinacy, hath ſmitten you with judicial blindneſs and ſtupidity; by reaſon whereof, ye mind things no more than thoſe do, that in a <hi>Lethargy</hi> are ſtricken with a deep ſleep; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10. and ſee alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. <hi>the prophets and your rulers, the ſeers hath he covered;</hi> to wit, with a miſt or veil of ſpiritual blindneſs; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.7.

Gods worſhip; and likewiſe their cloſe carrying on of their Plots, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of themſelves; whereby they hoped to evade the judgments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; as if they could hide their contrivements from God, as men are wont to turn a diſh or veſſel up-ſide down, that ſo they may hide that which is whelmed under it from being ſeen. And if we take it thus, then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that their <hi>turning of things up-ſide down,</hi> ſhould <hi>be eſteemed as the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters clay,</hi> in that, whilſt they ſought thus to hide their wickedneſs, their Plots or Projects from God, they lay as open to Gods eye, as the clay is to the Potter, when he is faſhioning of it upon the wheel; and that it was as groſs a piece of folly to think, that they could hide themſelves, their thoughts or deſigns from God, as it would be to think, that the clay ſhould be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the Potter.

And if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it thus, then by ſaying, <hi>Surely your turning of things up-ſide down, ſhall be eſteemed as the potters clay,</hi> the Prophet ſeems to intend, that in all theſe their contrivances, they ſhould be as the clay in the hand of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to wit, in that 1.

That whilſt they were wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning things up and down in their minds, ſometimes caſting them into one ſhape, and ſometimes into another, as the clay is molded now in one faſhion, and by and by in another: they were all this while under the power and government of Divine Providence; ſo that they could not do what they pleaſed themſelves, but only what God would have done; and it was in the power of God to deſtroy them, even whenever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And this ſuits well too with that which followeth, <hi>for ſhall the work ſay of him that made it, He made me not?</hi> &amp;c. the drift thereof being to ſhew, that for men to think they can do any thing without God, or againſt his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, who are in Gods hand as the clay is in the hand of the Potter, is all one in effect, as if they ſhould deny they were his creatures.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c.] Here, for the comfort of the faithful amongſt Gods people, the Prophet cloſeth this ſad Prophecy, as uſually he doth elſewhere, with many comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of much good that God would do for them, ſhortly after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the judgments before threatned; to wit, after the devaſtation

Or elſe myſtically, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the calling in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their ſtead, in the days of the Goſpel (which indeed very many learned Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do think is here intended); to wit, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that had been as <hi>Lebanon,</hi> a fruitleſs foreſt, ſhould by ſpiritual manuring become as <hi>Carmel,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of believers amongſt them, abounding in the fruits of holineſs and righteouſneſs; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> on the other ſide, that had been as <hi>Carmel,</hi> a fruitful field, ſhould become as a wild and fruitleſs fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, according to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof;</hi> which they ſay, is here foretold, as a change that ſhould ſhortly come to paſs, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years are with God but as <hi>a very little while.</hi> And again, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underſtand it, as ſpoken figuratively; to wit, that the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that were exalted like <hi>Lebanon,</hi> ſhould lye low like <hi>Carmel;</hi> namely, when their Army was deſtroyed by the Angel of the Lord, and the afflicted <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould lift up their heads like the lofty trees of the foreſt of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> But in regard the very ſame words, in a manner, are repeated again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.15. and are there clearly a promiſe, I cannot conceive, that they are here to be taken as a threatning. And for the latter of the two Expoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, that doth no way ſuit with our Tranſlation. And therefore that which is mentioned firſt, concerning the great fertility of the land, I conceive, was firſt and principally here intended by the Prophet. And if it be taken, as ſpoken in a myſtical ſenſe, it muſt then ſurely be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of the great abundance of Grace that ſhould be in the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>

becauſe they were rebellious againſt Gods command, whoſe children they profeſſed themſelves to be; and that particularly in this buſineſs, of their ſeeking to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, as appears by the following words; <hi>Wo to the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious children, ſaith the Lord, that take counſel, but not of me;</hi> which is ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe in their ſtreights they conſulted amongſt themſelves what to do, but never asked advice from God, by enquiring of Gods Prophets, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; or elſe, becauſe they were ſo far from that, that they therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the command of God by his Prophets. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>and that cover with a covering, but not of my ſpirit;</hi> that is, that ſeek to ſhelter themſelves againſt approaching ſtorms, and to poſſeſs the people with great hopes, that they ſhall be covered and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from them; but it is not by means which I approve of, and which I by my Spirit, in the mouth of my Prophets, have adviſed them to; it is not by turning to me by repentance, and by calling on me for counſel and help, but by ways of their own projecting; yea, contrary to what I have commanded; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5, 6. and 28.15, 20. <hi>that they may add ſin to ſin;</hi> that is, that to their ſin, in revolting from thoſe Heathen Kings, to whom they had yielded themſelves to be Tributaries (ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.7.) did now add the ſin of neglecting God, and fleeing to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help: Or that to their ſin, in calling in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to their help, formerly in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.7. did now add this ſin of running to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their help againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> Or rather, that to the wickedneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had provoked God to bring the Heathen upon them, they might add this new ſin, of ſeeking to ſhelter themſelves from this vengeance of God by unlawful ways.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>That walk to go down into Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] It was uſual with this people, when they were in danger of being invaded by any foreign enemies, to fly to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help. Thus <hi>Hoſhea</hi> ſent to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. And thus it ſeems in <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s time, they had procured the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to come and help them againſt the <hi>Chaldeans, Jer.</hi> 37.5, 7. and after the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had carried the <hi>Jews into Babylon,</hi> they that were left in the land of <hi>Judea</hi> fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſhelter themſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.5, 7. But yet I rather think, that here the Prophet ſpeaks of what was done in his own time, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> invaded <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſent his Captains to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For though in the ſtory, there be no expreſs mention of their ſending then to <hi>Egypt</hi> for aid, yet becauſe we find before that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had forewarned the <hi>Jews</hi> of their folly, in reſting at that time upon the aid of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.1, 6.

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For his Princes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, <hi>were at Zoan;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.11. <hi>and his ambaſſadours came to Hanes,</hi> elſewhere called <hi>Taha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panes, Jer.</hi> 2.16. and <hi>Tahpanhes, Jer.</hi> 43.7. This is ſpoken in a way of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſet forth how eager and buſie they were to ſeek for help from <hi>Egypt</hi> to no purpoſe at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>They were all aſhamed of a people that could not profit them,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>The burden of the beaſts of the South,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>the beaſts of the South</hi> here, are meant, either <hi>the young aſſes and camels,</hi> afterwards mentioned; on which the <hi>Jews</hi> carried the great Treaſures and Gifts wherewith they meant to hire the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to come and aid them againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thorough the Deſart, by which they were to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> both which lay <hi>South</hi>-ward from the land of <hi>Judea</hi> (as upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.19. the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> are called <hi>the Cities of the South</hi>): Or elſe the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, who are termed <hi>beaſts,</hi> either becauſe, like ſo many beaſts, they travelled along <hi>South</hi>-ward, with burdens on their backs, the great preſents they had provided for the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> or becauſe they were ſo brutiſhly fooliſh, as to diſobey and forſake God, that they might ſeek help from <hi>Egypt.</hi> And accordingly in theſe words, <hi>The burden of the beaſts of the South,</hi> the intent of the Prophet might be only to ſhew, that he would now declare, how in ſeeking to procure aid from <hi>Egypt,</hi> theſe beaſts of the <hi>South</hi> went with great burdens on their backs, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 46.1. he tells us, how the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Idols were <hi>a burden to the weary beaſt</hi> that carried them: Or elſe, which moſt Expoſitors hold, by <hi>the burden of the beaſts of the South,</hi> is meant, a heavy Prophecy denounced againſt the beaſts that went laden with great burdens of Treaſure <hi>South</hi>-ward, from <hi>Judea,</hi> into the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. And it may be taken, as ſpoken with reference to that which went before, or that which follows after; and that in a way of deſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the word <hi>burden;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, Since you will needs go with ſuch burdens of Treaſures into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to get Auxiliary Forces from thence, for your defence, lo I tell you of another kind of burden that God hath provided for you, <hi>The burden of the beaſts of the South;</hi> that is, a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome Prophecy, concerning the beaſts of the <hi>South.</hi> But however, if we underſtand this Prophecy, as denouncing evil againſt the beaſts, on which they carried their Preſents for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> we muſt know, that hereby his aim is to inveigh againſt the Princes themſelves that went along with them, deriding their folly and madneſs, in taking ſo much pains, and being at ſo much coſt to undo themſelves; and that he directs his Prophecy againſt <hi>the beaſts,</hi> to imply, that it was in vain to ſpeak to the men that were deaf to all that God could ſay to them, but that the beaſts ſhould feel the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42788:162"/>
of that which the men themſelves would not mind nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. And as for the following words, <hi>into the land of trouble and anguiſh, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying ſerpent: they will carry their riches upon the ſhoulders of young aſſes, and their treaſures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that ſhall not profit them;</hi> we muſt know, that by <hi>the land of trouble and anguiſh,</hi> may be meant, either 1. <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it had been to their forefathers a land of ſore oppreſſion and trouble, and ſo was like to be alſo unto them; which may ſeem the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe the word that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is uſed for <hi>Egypt,</hi> hath ſome affinity with that <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which is here rendered <hi>trouble.</hi> (And moſt that underſtand it thus, think that by <hi>the lion and viper, and fiery flying ſerpent</hi> coming from thence, is meant, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or their cruel and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Soldiers, as harmful to the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſuch cruel beaſts are). Or elſe rather 2. That vaſt wilderneſs on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> thorough which they were to paſs, as they went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein there was abundance of theſe harmful miſchievous creatures (ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15. and 32.10.) and particularly, <hi>fiery flying ſerpents;</hi> of which ſee the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.6. So that the drift of adding theſe words, ſeems to be, 1. to imply their fond eagerneſs in ſeeking to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, in that they were not afraid to hazard themſelves in ſuch a dangerous journey: And 2. to ſet forth their unhappineſs therein, in that this people, whoſe aid they did ſo ambitiouſly deſire, ſhould do them no good at all; ſee the Note above, ver. 3. which is farther alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For the Egyptians ſhall help in vain, and to no purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, In that though they ſhould attempt to do it, yet they ſhould not be able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. <hi>Therefore have I cryed concerning this;</hi> that is, I the Lord (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking now in the perſon of God), or I <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> by the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, have often, with much earneſtneſs, adviſed my people concerning this their running to <hi>Egypt</hi> for aid. Or, as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>therefore have I cried to her;</hi> that is, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the daughter of my people, as the Prophets uſed to ſpeak, <hi>Their ſtrength is to ſit ſtill;</hi> that is, that which will be moſt for their ſtrength and ſafety is, not to run out for help, either to <hi>Egypt</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but quietly to wait upon God, and to rely on his help. And it is well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a learned Expoſitor, that hereby it may be well inferred, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was not intended concerning <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s ſeeking to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, becauſe though they were told, that <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould not relieve them, yet they were not enjoyned to ſit ſtill, and wait upon God for help, but to go out, and yield up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Babylonian, Jer.</hi> 38.2, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Now go,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe are the words of God to the Prophet: <hi>Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Since I have ſo often warned them in vain; go now and <hi>write it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them;</hi> to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very ſame thing we find enjoyned the Prophet <hi>Habbakkuk, Chap.</hi> 2.2.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42788:163"/>
but ſee the Note before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1. <hi>that it may be for the time to come, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever;</hi> that is, that it may be a memorial and teſtimony to them and their poſterity in all ſucceeding Ages, both how carefully and faithfully I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and taught them what to do, and how obſtinately they refuſed to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>That this is a rebellious people, lying children,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, either 1. ſuch as are not the true children of God, but falſe and counterfeit children: Or 2. ſuch as are not what by covenant they had engaged themſelves, and what they outwardly profeſſed themſelves to be, according to that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. <hi>which ſay they are Jews, and are not, but do lie;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.13. <hi>children that will not hear the law of the Lord,</hi> that is, the word of God, and the teaching of his Prophets. Some think, that they are charged here, not only with not obeying, but alſo with not enduring to hear the inſtructions of Gods Prophets. Yea, and ſome conceive it is ſpoken with particular reſpect to that Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16. wherein they were forbidden to go down into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Which ſay to the ſeers, See not,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.27. <hi>and to the prophets, Prophecy not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, prophecy deceits.</hi> Some underſtand this, of their ſilencing Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and their enjoyning them not to preach to the People, unleſs they would give over that tartneſs and bitterneſs which they ordinarily uſed in their preaching. But the words are far more comprehenſive than ſo. Nor can it be probably thought, that the people were ſo fooliſh and impudent, as in expreſs terms to ſay theſe things with which they are here charged. But the Prophets meaning is, that theſe things were ſecretly in their hearts; ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. By their rage againſt Gods Prophets for their faithful reproofs and threatnings, it was evident, that they would have been glad their mouths might have been ſtopped, unleſs they would have flattered them. And what was this, but to deſire they might be deceived?</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Get you out of the way, turn aſide out of the path,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Give over this rough and bitter way of prophecying which we continually hear from you. And if you ſay, We ſpeak what God hath given us in charge; we preach in the way that God hath preſcribed us; then we anſwer, <hi>Get you</hi> then <hi>out of the way;</hi> for this is a way of prophecying which we cannot, nor will not endure: <hi>cauſe the Holy one of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us;</hi> that is, ſpeak no more to us of <hi>the Holy one of Iſrael;</hi> let us no more hear that ringing ſo often in our ears. Becauſe the Prophets (and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> it may be more eſpecially) in reproving this people for their ſins, and preſſing them to holineſs, did often ſuitably mention God under this name of <hi>the Holy one of Iſrael</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4.) therefore they are brought in here thus in a ſcoffing way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelves; as if this name of God were of all others moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to them, and that they deſired not to be wearied any longer with the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repeating of this name to them. But for this alſo ſee the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:42788:163"/>Ver. 12. <hi>Wherefore thus ſaith the Holy one of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, Though you flout at this holy name of the Lord God, and though it be never ſo odious to you, yet ſhall not I fear ſtill and ſtill to preach to you in his name: and take notice therefore, I ſay, what this <hi>holy one of Iſrael</hi> ſaith concerning you, <hi>Becauſe ye deſpiſe this word;</hi> to wit, that before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Egyptians ſhall help in vain,</hi> &amp;c. Or rather more generally, <hi>this word</hi> of Gods command, that you ſhould not ſeek unto <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, but rely wholly upon God (as indeed many will pretend a willingneſs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the word of God, who yet when it comes to it, will not obey <hi>the word</hi> which God ſpeaks to them), <hi>and truſt in oppreſſion</hi> (or <hi>fraud) and perverſeneſs, and ſtay thereon;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, and truſt in your riches, formerly gotten by oppreſſion and fraud, and other unjuſt courſes, as hoping herewith to hire the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to help you. But I rather conceive, that by the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and perverſeneſs wherein they are here ſaid to truſt, is meant, their furious and froward carrying on their deſigns of ſending to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, contrary to Gods command, not without a violent over-bearing of thoſe that oppoſed it; yea, even the Prophets themſelves, that by warrant from God did reprove and forbid it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Therefore this iniquity ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out in a high wall, whoſe breaking cometh ſuddenly at an inſtant.]</hi> That is, This your ſin in truſting in your wealth ſo unjuſtly gotten, and in the aid of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which you hope to procure thereby, ſhall be the cauſe of your utter and ſudden ruin; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.3. The bulking or ſwelling out of a wall, eſpecially of a <hi>high wall,</hi> whoſe weight muſt needs help forward its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is a ſure ſign of its approaching ruin: ſo the pride and arrogancy of the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for to them the Prophet chiefly ſpeaks), who are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a wall of defence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was a certain fore-runner of their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fall and deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. And as mens leaning on ſuch a bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying wall, is like to haſten its fall; ſo the peoples reſting on theſe men, and their politick deſigns, in ſeeking to <hi>Egypt,</hi> was like to haſten their ſpeedy ruin.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And he,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God, or the enemy, <hi>ſhall break it;</hi> that is, the deſign you have of calling in the <hi>Egyytians</hi> to your aid (the <hi>iniquity</hi> before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.) or the State of <hi>Judah,</hi> or the City <hi>Jeruſalem, as the breaking of the potters veſſel, that is broken in pieces;</hi> that is, utterly and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>he ſhall not ſpare,</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid, As the owner of an earthen pitcher, or other veſſel, doth with great violence daſh it againſt a wall, or throw it upon the pavement, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to break it into ſhivers, not caring what becomes of it; <hi>ſo that there ſhall not be found in the burſting of it, a ſheard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withall out of the pit,</hi> ſo will the Lord deal with you: he will utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you, without entertaining any thought to pity or ſpare you. Here therefore more is threatned than in the former verſe. A wall fallen down, may be built up again; but an earthen veſſel being once broken to pieces, cannot be ſet together again. And hereby therefore the State of <hi>Judah</hi> is threatned with irreparable ruin. Now though this befell them not in the days
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42788:164"/>
of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (the Lord having great reſpect to him, and other his righteous Servants in his time), yet becauſe afterwards, in the days of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> they offended again in the ſame kind, by fleeing to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, that which is here threatned was then fully accompliſhed, their State being then utterly ruined by the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God, the Holy one of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, This is that which he hath and doth adviſe you to do; ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>In returning and reſt ſhall ye be ſaved;</hi> that is, If you repent and turn from your evil ways, and particularly, from that of ſeeking to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, and reſt upon God for help, God will ſave you from your enemies: <hi>in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and in confidence ſhall be your ſtrength;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>and ye would not;</hi> that is, you would not herein hearken to God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>But ye ſaid, no; for we will flee upon horſes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, If the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> do prevail over us, we will flee away upon Horſes; or we will go to <hi>Egypt,</hi> that we may thence furniſh our ſelves with Horſes (ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.28.) which, in regard of their ſtrength and ſwiftneſs, will be of great uſe for us, both for the aſſailing and purſuing of our enemies, and for eſcaping away by flight, ſhould we be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them. But I rather think, that hereby is meant, that they would not only not wait upon God, but would with all the ſpeed they could, poſt away into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to procure aid from thence: And therefore in oppoſition to this which they ſaid, the Prophet adds, <hi>therefore ſhall ye flee:</hi> as if he had ſaid, The event of this your fleeing into <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, ſhall be only this, that <hi>ye ſhall flee</hi> before your enemies the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows; whereas they ſaid, <hi>and we will ride upon the ſwift;</hi> that is, ſwift beaſts, to wit, Horſes or Dromedaries, God hereto anſwers, <hi>therefore ſhall they that purſue you be ſwift;</hi> that is, they ſhall match you, if not exceed you in ſwiftneſs. Many, I know, underſtand this of the flight of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and his Men of War, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.4. and the flight of the remnant that was left after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.5, 7. But I ſee not why it might not be as well intended concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> fleeing before the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> made ſuch havock in the land before he beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid for the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>One thouſand ſhall flee at the rebuke of one,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, At the aſſault of one, or at the ſhouting of one, when he comes to make an aſſault upon you: <hi>at the rebuke of five ſhall ye flee;</hi> that is, a poor inconſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your enemies ſhall make you all flee; <hi>till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain</hi> (or as it is in the margin, <hi>a tree bereft of branches and boughs,</hi> or <hi>a maſt</hi>); that is, ſay ſome, like ſome high pole, reſembling the maſt of a Ship, ſet up on a hill, to be a Way-mark for Travellers or Seamen; or to give warning to the Country about of the approach of Enemies, or ſome other ſuch like publick ſervice; or <hi>as a maſt</hi> of a Ship is ſeen a far off, ſtanding up alone by it ſelf, when no part of the Ship beſides is ſeen: <hi>and as an enſign on an hill,</hi> to wit, ſet up there, as a Trophy of ſome Victory there obtained; or a ſign to ſhew Soldiers that are gathering together, whither they ſhould come. The meaning is, that being overcome by their Enemies, there ſhould
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42788:164"/>
be very few of them <hi>left</hi> alive; or at leaſt, <hi>left</hi> in a Company together; but that they ſhould be diſperſed and ſtraggle about, here one, and there another; or that they ſhould be ſo generally carried away Captives, that there ſhould be but a few of them <hi>left</hi> in the land; and that their deſtruction ſhould be nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſpicuous; ſo that they ſhould be a gazing-ſtock to all Nations, for the ſtrange judgments inflicted on them, as ſuch a <hi>beacon</hi> or <hi>maſt</hi> uſed to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at by thoſe that paſs by it. But now ſome underſtand this of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to wit, that any other Cities of <hi>Judea</hi> round about her being deſtroyed, ſhe ſhould be left alone on the hill whereon ſhe ſtood, <hi>as a beacon</hi> or <hi>a maſt</hi> of a Ship. And indeed if this were ſpoken with reſpect to that havock which <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſhould make in the land (for which ſee the Note), this Expoſition may ſeem the more probable.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet begins to comfort the faithful amongſt his people; <hi>And therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> But yet the meaning of the words is queſtionable. 1. Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Lords waiting by way of forbearing a while to bring that ruin upon them before threatned, to ſee if they would repent and turn unto him, that ſo he might be gracious to them, according to that which is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. that <hi>the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing.</hi> And thus they conceive that a Reaſon is here given, why the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here threatned were not preſently executed upon them: It was becauſe God was pleaſed to wait for their repentance; <hi>And therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Do not flatter your ſelves, that you ſhall never ſee this come to paſs, becauſe you ſee it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently done; therefore only will the Lord ſuſpend the judgment threatned for a time, that he may wait for your repentance, and ſo then may receive you again into his favour. But then 2. Some underſtand it (and I think upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds) of Gods deferring to come in to their help, when their enemies did ſo far prevail over them, and ſo ſorely diſtreſs them; to wit, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would ſuffer their enemies to proceed ſo far, and to bring them to ſo low an ebb, that he might <hi>wait</hi> for a fit opportunity, when he might moſt ſeaſonably appear for their deliverance; as namely, when they being broken with theſe evils, were humbled and brought to repent of their evil ways, and to turn unto the Lord; or when it might be done with moſt advantage of glory to himſelf, good and joy to them, and ſhame and confuſion to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And much to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth; <hi>and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you:</hi> For though ſome underſtand by Gods being <hi>exalted,</hi> his withdrawing himſelf, as it were, into the Heavens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, his hiding himſelf and ſtanding aloof from the help of his people, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely that he might take a fit time to ſhew mercy to his people: Yet I rather think, that hereby is meant, that God would be <hi>exalted,</hi> either 1. by the ſtrange and wonderful deſtruction wherewith he meant to deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> or 2. by his peoples humbling themſelves, and abandoning their ſinful ways, and turning to the Lord: Or 3. by thoſe judgments upon them, whereby he would bring them to be ſo reformed: his end in all theſe being chiefly this, that he might be gracious and merciful to them.</p>

                  <hi>For the Lord is a God of judgment,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When God puniſheth his people, he is not tranſported with rage and fury, as men are, but doth it with moderation and judgment, ſo as it may do them good; according to that, <hi>O Lord correct me, but with judgment, not in thine anger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him;</hi> to wit, as knowing, that God, as is before ſaid, is wont to wait to be gracious to his people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>For the people ſhall dwell in Zion at Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be added, as a proof of that which was ſaid in the cloſe of the foregoing verſe; <hi>bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi> And though ſome underſtand it, as a promiſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> dwelling again at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after their return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet I conceive it is primarily meant of that which was more ſhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, when thou art beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> or, as others, when thou art in captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And though the Lord give you the bread of adverſity and the water of affliction,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.27. <hi>yet ſhall not thy teachers be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a corner any more;</hi> which though ſome underſtand barely as a promiſe that they ſhould not be deſtitute of faithful Teachers to inſtruct them, though they might ſuffer great harſhip in regard of their bodily food, they ſhould be, however, well provided for ſpiritual food yet more ſeems to be intended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to wit, that thenceforth they ſhould not deſpiſe and perſecute their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and drive them into corners to hide themſelves, as they had formerly done (this thoſe words <hi>any more</hi> ſeems to imply); ſee the Notes before, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers;</hi> to wit, with great content and delight, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively fixing thine eyes upon them when they are inſtructing thee. Thou ſhalt eagerly look after them that before were but eye-ſores to thee. Now all this I conceive is mentioned, as an effect that ſhould follow upon the Reformation which the judgment inflicted on them ſhould through grace work in them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not limit it, as many do, to the great ſtreights they were in, either when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> or after their return out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.]</hi> That is, ſay ſome, in all thy ways, whitherſoever thou goeſt. Or rather, when ye are about to turn ſome way or other out of the right way. And by this <hi>word behind</hi> them, may be meant, both 1. the word of their Teachers, mentioned in the foregoing verſe, whereby God would be continually ready to direct them in the right way, and to keep them from going aſtray. (There ſeems to be in this expreſſion, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to School-Maſters, who following their Scholars, as they go along, the better to watch over them, are wont to call to them, and mind them of their way, when they do not regard it as they ſhould; or to Shepherds, that coming
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42788:165"/>
behind their ſheep, uſe to whiſtle them in, when he ſees them begin to ſtraggle). And likewiſe 2. the voice of Gods Spirit, whereby he doth ſecretly ſpeak to their Hearts, and perſwade them to follow the direction of their Teachers. Yea, and 3. that God would follow them with the admonitions and perſwaſions of his Word and Spirit, even then when they turned their backs upon him, not giving over until he had prevailed with them. For thoſe words, <hi>thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee,</hi> ſeem to imply, that as God would give them Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo he would alſo give them <hi>ears</hi> to hearken to, and obey their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy graven images of ſilver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning is, That after God had humbled them by the judgments before mentioned, and after the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance he had wrought for them, before promiſed, they ſhould take the Plates of Silver and Gold, wherewith their Images were covered, or the rich Garments and Ornaments wherewith they were attired; or rather their Images themſelves, covered and over-laid with Leaves or Plates of Silver and Gold, and ſhould break or tear them in pieces, as filthy things, and diſpoſe of them in ſome common, prophane and diſgraceful way; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.20. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it,</hi> that is, to each of the things before mentioned, <hi>Get thee hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Then ſhall he give the rain of thy ſeed that thou ſhalt ſow thy ground withall, and bread of the encreaſe of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] As with reference to that which was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. concerning Gods giving them <hi>the bread of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and the water of affliction,</hi> here the Prophet promiſeth, that upon their repentance God would cauſe their Land to yield them a rich encreaſe (and this ſhould abundantly make up all the damage they had received by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians); and it,</hi> thy Grain or Bread-corn, <hi>ſhall be fat and plenteous;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.14.

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>The oxen likewiſe, and the young aſſes that ear the ground, ſhall eat clean provender,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou ſhalt have ſuch abundance of Corn, that thou ſhalt give thy Cattel <hi>clean provender;</hi> to wit, provender of pure Corn, without any mixture of Chaff; <hi>which hath been winnowed with the ſhovel and with the fan;</hi> that is, with either of them, or with both, one after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And there ſhall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and ſtreams of waters,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, So great ſhall the ſhowers of Rain be, mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. that from the Mountains and Hills, ſtreams of water, like Rivers, ſhall run down into the Vallies, which ſhall make the whole land yield great encreaſe: yea, even thoſe Mountains and Hills that uſed to be dry and barren. <hi>In the day of the great ſlaughter, when the towers fall;</hi> that is, at the time when God ſhall make a mighty ſlaughter amongſt your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that had brought you into ſo great ſtreights, wherein, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, even their great Nobles and Princes ſhall fall, the over-topping <hi>Towers</hi> here meant; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.15. So that this is added, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſet forth, how exceeding great the mercy of God to them at that time
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42788:166"/>
ſhould be; and how exceeding great their joy thereupon would be (which he farther enlargeth in the following verſe), when at the ſame time he ſhould make ſuch havock amongſt their Enemies, and withall bleſs their Land with ſo great an encreaſe. Many, I know, underſtand this of the great ſlaughter of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and by the <hi>Towers</hi> that ſhould fall, many underſtand the Towers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the high Towers which the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had built for the beſieging of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But the former Expoſition doth far better ſuit with the ſequel of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Moreover,</hi> &amp;c.] This in this verſe is added, to ſet forth thoſe rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of joy wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be tranſported, when on a ſudden God ſhould ſo miraculouſly deſtroy their proud Enemies the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and thereby deliver them from from all thoſe fears and dangers they were in, and out of which it ſeemed impoſſible they ſhould ever eſcape. <hi>Moreover the light of the moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun.</hi> The Prophet (ſay ſome) begins with this, becauſe this ſlaughter of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> was made in the night: <hi>and the light of the ſun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the light of the ſeven days;</hi> that is, the Sun ſhall ſhine with as much brightneſs on that day, as if ſeven Suns were ſhining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound;</hi> that is, when the Lord ſhall heal the State of <hi>Judah</hi> of all the breaches and wounds made therein by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or rather by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> Light is uſually put for joy in the Scripture (ſee the Notes, <hi>Eſther</hi> 8.16. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4.) and darkneſs for ſorrow. And hence it is, that as the Heavenly Lights are ſaid to withdraw their light from men, when they are in extream darkneſs and ſorrow; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.10. ſo here on the contrary, to ſet forth what exceeding joy there ſhould be amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhould be vanquiſhed by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould ſet them free from their bondage; or rather (as is often noted before) when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be ſo ſuddenly and ſtrangely delivered from the invaſion and ſiege of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> it is ſaid, that the Moon ſhould ſhine as bright as the Sun, and that the light of the Sun ſhould be ſevenfold more than at other times it is. The meaning is, that the Heavenly Lights ſhould ſeem to congratulate them for their happineſs, in their being ſo miraculouſly delivered out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jaws of death; and that they ſhould think the light of that day, through the exceſs of their joy, ſevenfold brighter than any day they had ſeen before. Some, I know, underſtand this of the glorious condition of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Yea indeed, moſt Expoſitors underſtand it of the exceeding great joy and glory of the Church upon Earth, in the days of the Goſpel, when Gods people ſhould be healed of all the wounds and breaches which ſin had made in their Souls, by that great work of Chriſts Redemption, by the pardon of their Sins, and the Sanctifying of their Nature; to wit, that the glory and joy of the Church then, ſhould be ſevenfold greater than ever it had been in the days of the Old Teſtament; yea, ſevenfold greater than the brightneſs of the Heavenly Lights. And indeed, becauſe thoſe great deliverances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> before mentioned, were types and ſhadows of this our greater deliverance by Chriſt, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but that this which the Prophet ſaith here, may be juſtly applied thereto. But yet I ſay, primarily and properly it is meant, of that great deliverance
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42788:166"/>
of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Tyranny of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet begins more largely to ſet forth the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians; in the day of the great ſlaughter,</hi> mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Behold the name of the Lord cometh from far;</hi> that is, the Lord cometh from Heaven; even as we uſe to ſay, His Majeſty is coming, when we intend thereby the King himſelf. But why doth the Prophet uſe this expreſſion? I anſwer, that there are Reaſons given by Expoſitors for this, that are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; as 1. That he ſaith not, <hi>The Lord cometh,</hi> but <hi>The name of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> either 1. by way of ſlighting the contempt of the Heathen, who were wont to deride the <hi>Jews</hi> for worſhipping only the Name of a God, an imaginary God, whereas they had the Images of the Gods whom they worſhipped, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which one of them ſaid of that people, <hi>Qui puras nubes, &amp; coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Numen adorant:</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, even that inviſible God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hath revealed himſelf to us only by his <hi>Name,</hi> will come and be revenged on you for the wrong ye have done his people: Or 2. to imply, that he told them of that, the report whereof he had heard from a far: he had heard glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things ſpoken of the coming of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt them, whoſe Name was famous and great throughout the world: Or 3. to ſignifie, that the Angel, by whom the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, ſhould do it in Gods Name, and by Commiſſion from God. And 2. That he ſaith, <hi>Behold the name of the Lord cometh from far;</hi> to imply, that however God had ſeemed, both to his people and to their enemies, to ſtand a far off, yet now he would come in ſuddenly and unexpectedly to the deliverance of his people, and to the ruin of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. As for the following words, <hi>burning with his anger; and the burden thereof is heavy:</hi> or as it is the margin, <hi>and the grievouſneſs of flame;</hi> the meaning thereof is, that the Lord would come againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in the heat of great and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fury; and that this his anger would, in the vengeance he would pour upon them, prove a heavy and intollerable burden to them upon whom it ſhould light. And ſo in the laſt words; <hi>his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire,</hi> the Lord is ſet forth after the manner of a man full of wrath, whoſe lips ſeem to tremble and ſwell with anger, and whoſe words ſound nothing but terror and threatnings. And it is well obſerved by a learned Expoſitor, that the Prophet doth the rather expreſs Gods anger by the words of his mouth, to imply, that however they deſpiſed his word, yet his threatnings would have their effect, and the ſentence that proceeded out of his mouth, would be a fire to conſume his enemies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And his breath as an over-flowing ſtream, ſhall reach to the midſt of the neck,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, It ſhall bring the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> into a dangerous condition, as that man is in a ſtream of water up to the midſt of the neck. Before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.8. it was ſaid of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> that he ſhould overflow the whole Land and State of <hi>Judah,</hi> even to the neck: and here now, perhaps in relation thereto, it is ſaid, the torrent of Gods wrath ſhould overflow the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> even <hi>to the midſt of the neck; to ſift the nations,</hi> to wit, thoſe that ſerved in <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, <hi>with the ſive of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> that is, to diſtreſs and trouble them, till they were all ſcattered and caſt out, and utterly deſtroyed. By a <hi>ſive of vanity,</hi> the Prophet ſeems to intend, a ſive that lets all things run thorough it till there be nothing left; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42788:167"/>
that which is meant here is, that tho the Nations came with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver ſo great multitudes, yet God would turn them off, and ſcatter them like ſo much chaff, till they were brought to nothing. And to the ſame purpoſe is the next figurative expreſſion alſo; <hi>and there ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, cauſing them to err;</hi> that is, for the remainder of them that are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Angel of the Lord, God would carry them away, which ſhould be quite contrary to what they deſigned, even as the Rider turns the fierceſt Horſe with a bit and bridle; namely, in that inſtead of going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he would cauſe them to fly back to their own Country; or at leaſt, cauſe them to wander up and down in a ſcattered manner, now one way, and then another, till they periſhed. And this is juſt what the Lord by our Prophet ſaid to <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> concerning <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.28. <hi>I will put my hook in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>Te ſhall have a ſong as in the night, when a holy ſolemnity is kept,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, when God ſhall have thus deſtroyed your enemies, as is before ſaid, ye ſhall then ſing for joy in a holy manner, giving praiſe and glory to God, who hath done this for you, even as you are wont to do <hi>the night</hi> before your ſolemn feſtivals; to wit, thoſe three great feſtivals, when all their males went up to the Temple; ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. the ſolemnity whereof began always the evening before the feſtival day: <hi>and gladneſs of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountains of the Lord, to the mighty one of Iſrael:</hi> which is ſaid, becauſe they that went up to the Temple which ſtood on Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> from other parts of the land at theſe ſolemn feaſts, uſed, it ſeems, to go along ſinging and playing upon muſical Inſtruments, for joy that they were going to meet with their God in his holy Sanctuary; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And the Lord ſhall cauſe his glorious voice to be heard,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſeveral learned Expoſitors, The deſtruction of your enemies ſhall be ſuch, that it ſhall be as plainly perceived, that it is the judgment of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, inflicted by his command, as if an audible voice had been heard from Heaven, enjoyning it to be done; <hi>and ſhall ſhew the lighting down of his arm,</hi> to wit, from Heaven upon your enemies, <hi>with the indignation of his anger;</hi> that is, he ſhall make it apparent, that it is the Lord that ſmites them, and that in great wrath (which muſt needs terrifie them); and ſo they ſhall feel how heavy his hand is, when he ſtrikes in fury. And ſo, ſay they, the Prophet proceeds on in the following words, to ſet forth the breaking out of Gods wrath againſt them figuratively after the mannet of a tempeſt; <hi>and with the flame of a devouring fire, with ſcattering, and tempeſt, and hail-ſtones;</hi> ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8. and that to ſhew, that their deſtruction ſhould be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and violent. Yet becauſe thunder is often called <hi>the voice of the Lord</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.3.) and <hi>Job</hi> 37.4. <hi>the voice of his excellency;</hi> and the whole verſe here, ſeems to ſet forth a mighty ſtorm and tempeſt: I ſee not, why it may not be well thought, which ſome Expoſitors hold, that when the Angel of the Lord made a ſlaughter in <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. it was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by ſuch a hideous ſtorm raiſed by the Miniſtry of the Angels, and that of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42788:167"/>
this the Prophet here ſpeaks. And indeed the like is ſaid concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> army in the Red Sea, ſee the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>For through the voice of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note, <hi>ſhall the Aſſyrian be beaten down,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> (and indeed it cannot be denied, that the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> were alſo called Kings of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> becauſe <hi>Aſſyria</hi> alſo was under their dominion, ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11. And ſo likewiſe were the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6.22.) or rather <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> he and his army ſhall be deſtroyed: And then in the next words, <hi>which ſmote with a rod,</hi> there is an imitation of the juſt vengeance of God; He that had wont to ſmite others with a rod, (he alludes to what was ſaid before concerning the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſmiting <hi>Judea, Chap.</hi> 10.5, 24.) ſhall be now ſmitten himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>And in every place where the grounded ſtaff ſhall paſs, which the Lord ſhall lay upon him, it ſhall be with Tabrets and Harps,</hi> &amp;c.] By the <hi>grounded ſtaff</hi> here, ſome underſtand the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the rod or ſtaff of Gods anger, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foregoing verſe, wherewith the land of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be ſmitten: And that this ſtaff is called <hi>the grounded ſtaff,</hi> becauſe it was certainly appointed for their correction by the decree of God, who ſhould bring it upon them: And accordingly they take the meaning of that place to be this, that in every place of <hi>Judea,</hi> where this ſtaff the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> (it is an expreſſion juſt like that <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.18. <hi>The overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through</hi>) ſhould paſs, the inhabitants ſhould afterwards make merry and rejoice exceedingly, to wit, when God had routed and deſtroyed that proud inſulting army; for ſo they expound thoſe words, <hi>it ſhall be with Tabrets and Harps,</hi> that is, that place, where the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> formerly made ſuch havock amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall be full of piping and dancing, for joy at his deſtruction. But becauſe the Prophet is all along ſpeaking here of Gods deſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> I rather think that by <hi>the grounded ſtaff</hi> here, is meant that rod or ſtaff of Gods indignation, wherewith he had threatned in the foregoing verſe that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould be <hi>beaten down;</hi> that Judgment, whether the tempeſt before deſcribed, or what ever elſe it was, <hi>which,</hi> as it is ſaid here, <hi>the Lord ſhall lay upon him,</hi> or, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, cauſe to reſt upon him,</hi> and wherewith he was to be utterly ruined and deſtroyed; and that it is called a <hi>founded</hi> or <hi>grounded ſtaff,</hi> either, 1. Becauſe it was ſurely founded on Gods decree, and could not therefore be hindered. Or, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould be ſtable and permanent, and ſhould ſtay and reſt upon them: wherein there is a difference put betwixt the rod of correction, wherewith God chaſtiſeth his Children, which doth not reſt alwaies upon the lot of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. and the rod of Iron, which is for the puniſhment of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and deſtroyeth for ever. Or rather, 3. Becauſe the ſtroaks thereof ſhould not be light, giving their skins only a gentle gliding touch, but ſhould pierce deep, and ſtick by them, entring the very fleſh, and leaving ſore wounds and bruiſes behind them. Now if we underſtand <hi>the grounded ſtaff</hi> thus, the meaning of the place ſeems to be this; that in every place where this ſtaff of divine vengeance ſhould fall upon them, whether it were in the camp, far or near, as it lay ſpread abroad, or in any place whither they were fled, yea, though they were gotten home to their own
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42788:168"/>
Country (which was the caſe of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.36, 37.) it ſhould be with <hi>Tabrets and Harps,</hi> that is, with great triumphant joy for their ruin and deſtruction. Indeed thoſe words, <hi>it ſhall be with Tabrets and Harps,</hi> are many other ways expounded by thoſe that have undertaken to ſhew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this paſſage; as 1. That this Judgment ſhould come upon the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> when they were in great jollity, piping and dancing, not in the leaſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being ſo ſurpriſed and deſtroyed. 2. That it ſhould be brought upon them, rather by the Sacrifices that ſhould be offered by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which they ſay is intimated in thoſe words <hi>with Tabrets and Harps,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Sacrifices uſed to be accompanied with ſome kind of ſolemn muſick) than by fighting and weapons of War. And thus too they expound alſo that which is ſaid in the following clauſe, concerning <hi>Battels of ſhaking,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby their Shake-Offerings, or Wave Offerings: Or, 3. That in alluſion to the cuſtom of going forth to battel in thoſe times <hi>with Tabrets and Harps,</hi> (as we do now with Drum and Fife) thoſe words do import, that God would fight againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in another manner; to wit, with thunder and lightning, and hail-ſtones, thoſe ſhould <hi>be Tabrets and Harps.</hi> But the firſt expoſition is moſt genuine, as well as moſt common. As for the following clauſe, that is added farther to ſet forth the ſeverity of Gods proceedings with them; <hi>and in battels of ſhaking will he fight with it;</hi> that is, the rod, the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. or <hi>againſt them,</hi> as it is in the margin; that is, the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And the dreadful judgment wherewith God would contend with them, are called <hi>battels of ſhaking,</hi> either with reſpect to the terror wherewith they ſhould ſtrike them; or with particular reſpect to the dreadful convulſion of the tempeſt before deſcribed, wherewith, as with <hi>a ſive of vanity,</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. they ſhould be ſhaken to nothing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>For Tophet is ordained of old,</hi> &amp;c.] There was a place ſo called, in a Valley on the <hi>South</hi>-ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> concerning which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10. Now becauſe it ſeems not improbable, that when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> came to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he encamped with his Army, at leaſt, ſome part of it, in this place, therefore ſome think that it was in this place that the Angel of the Lord ſlew ſuch multitudes in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>-Camp; or at leaſt, that here the <hi>Jews</hi> buried or burnt the carcaſſes of thoſe that were ſo ſlain: For (ſay they) when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the beginning of his Reign, beat down the Idols, and removed the high places that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> it is moſt likely that he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this place (as <hi>Joſiah</hi> alſo afterwards did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10.) and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a common lay-ſtall, into which all the filth was caſt out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>). And with reſpect thereto, the Prophet doth here foretel what in this place ſhould be done to the <hi>Aſſyrians; for Tophet is ordained of old;</hi> that is, it was appointed of old by God for this purpoſe; or it was before time fitted for this ſervice, to wit, by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he defiled it, as is before ſaid; and ſo made it as fit for this uſe, as if it had been deſigned thereto: <hi>yea, for the king it is prepared;</hi> that is, for the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s Army, even the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders therein, called before, Kings; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.8. <hi>he hath made it deep and large;</hi> to wit, as being a Valley capacious enough every way for the multitudes that ſhall be ſlain there; <hi>the pile thereof is fire and much
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42788:168"/>
wood;</hi> that is, they ſhall be ſuddenly deſtroyed there, as if they were burnt up in a huge fire (and it may be this may be ſpoken too with relation to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fires that were made there for the burning of the hundred fourſcore and five thouſand of that Army that were ſlain there, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35.) <hi>the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it;</hi> that is, the Lord in great wrath and fury ſhall utterly conſume them. It is an expreſſion much like that before, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>And his breath, as an overflowing ſtream, ſhall reach to the midſt of the neck.</hi> And it may be the <hi>brimſtone</hi> mentioned, may alſo have reſpect to the thunder and lightning in that grievous tempeſt before deſcribed, which are known to have a ſulphureous ſavour. Thus, I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the concluſion of theſe words with that which went before, they muſt (I conceive) be firſt and literally underſtood of that very <hi>Tophet,</hi> in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the Son of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> where the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army was to be deſtroyed, or their carcaſſes burnt. But then ſecondly, and yet withal principally, By the general conſent almoſt of all Expoſitors, the <hi>Tophet</hi> wherewith the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are here threatned, is Hell, ſo called with reſpect to the lamentable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſhrieks and cries of the poor children that were there offered up in ſacrifice to <hi>Moloch;</hi> ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10. As Heaven, in alluſion to that pleaſant Garden where <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt placed, is called Paradice, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. ſo Hell, in alluſion to the filthy abominableneſs thereof, and the tormenting burnings that were therein, is called <hi>Tophet.</hi> And indeed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription here given of <hi>Tophet,</hi> doth well ſuit herewith. 1. It was <hi>ordained of old,</hi> decreed and appointed by God from all eternity, and made from the foundations of the earth in the firſt creation, for the puniſhment of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. 2. <hi>Yea, for the King it is prepared;</hi> that is, the greateſt on earth, ſuch as was blaſpheming <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> as well as the meaneſt. And obſervable it is, that the ſame expreſſion is uſed concerning Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. where it is ſaid to be <hi>prepared for the Devil and his angels.</hi> 3. <hi>He hath made it deep and large,</hi> capacious enough for the receiving of thoſe innumerable multitudes that are to be caſt into it, and out of which they can never get, being once thrown into it. 4. <hi>The pile thereof is fire and much wood;</hi> that is, the torments thereof ſhall be exceeding bitter, and withal endleſs; and therefore called everlaſting and unquenchable fire. And 5. <hi>The breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it;</hi> that is, by the decree and command of God, pronounced in great wrath and indignation againſt the wicked, it ſhall be ſtill kept burning for ever and ever: with reſpect whereto, Hell is often called in Scripture, <hi>the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO to them that go down to</hi> Egypt <hi>for help,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, Chap. 30.2. <hi>And ſtay on and truſt in Chariots, becauſe they are many; and in Horſe-men, becauſe they are very ſtrong:</hi> See the Note there alſo, Ver. 16. <hi>But they look not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See the Notes, Chap. 1.4. <hi>Neither ſeek the Lord,</hi> to wit, whom they had ſo often found a ſure defence to them, even againſt their ſtrongeſt enemies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Yet he alſo is wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, as in a way of deriſion, You applaud your ſelves in your Wiſdom and Policy, and think it is the only wiſe courſe you can take for the ſecuring of your ſelves from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to call in the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to your help; and that it were palpable folly in you to do what God by his Prophets hath enjoyned you to do, namely, to rely wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and not to ſend to your neighbours the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for aid. Well, as wiſe as you think your ſelves, do you judg your ſelves wiſer than God, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel you deſpiſe? Surely <hi>he alſo is wiſe,</hi> yea infinitely wiſer than your wiſe <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> can be, on whom you ſo much rely (See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.11.) And therefore knows many ways how to diſappoint all your politick deſigns, whereby you oppoſe his commands. <hi>Yet he alſo is wiſe, and will bring evil,</hi> that is, he will bring that evil upon you, which you think to keep off by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> help; <hi>and will not call back his words,</hi> to wit, which he hath ſpoken by me, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil which the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhall bring upon you: <hi>But will ariſe againſt the houſe of the evil doers,</hi> that is, againſt the wicked <hi>Jews, the rebellious People</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of Chap. 30.9. <hi>And againſt the help of them that work iniquity,</hi> that is, againſt the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> that ſhall come into the aid of this wicked People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Now the</hi> Egyptians <hi>are men, and not God,</hi> &amp;c.] And therefore able to do nothing without God, and much leſs againſt God Almighty, when he ſets himſelf to puniſh his People for their wickedneſs; <hi>And their Horſes, fleſh, and not Spirit;</hi> that is, not to be compared in regard of power to a ſpirit; <hi>When the Lord ſhall ſtretch out his Hand;</hi> as if it had been ſaid, if he doth only <hi>ſtretch out his Hand,</hi> that alone will be enough, <hi>both he that helpeth ſhall fall, and he that is holpen ſhall fall down, and they all ſhall fail together,</hi> See the foregoing Note. It is ſpoken in a way of deriding them for their hoping ſo much in the help of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And that which is here threatned came to paſs, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> for a while made ſuch havock in the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For thus hath the Lord ſpoken unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] Here a promiſe is inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that however the Lord would certainly, as he had ſaid, deſtroy both thoſe that would need ſeek to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> likewiſe that helped them; yet he would as certainly preſerve <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42788:169"/>
being ſurprized by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſo would ſave a remnant of his People from being deſtroyed. And the drift of this is to make it clear to them, how ſafely they might have reſted upon him alone, without ever looking after the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for help. <hi>Like as the Lion and young Lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of Shepherds is called forth againſt him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abaſe himſelf for the noiſe of them;</hi> to wit, by letting go his prey, or fleeing from them; <hi>So ſhall the Lord of hoſts come down,</hi> to wit, from Heaven <hi>to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof,</hi> that is, the hill <hi>Morias,</hi> where the Temple ſtood; which is particularly expreſſed, to imply Gods tender care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the place where he was worſhipped. The drift of the ſimilitude is to ſet forth, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould find the Lord as able, and as earneſtly intent to ſave her out of the hand of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> though their army were never ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as a Lion is to hold faſt, and not to part with the prey he hath gotten, though never ſuch a multitude of Shepherds be gathered together againſt him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>As birds flying, ſo will the Lord of hoſts defend Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, God will ſo defend <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſhe ſhall be as ſafe as birds are when they are flying. But rather the meaning is, either, 1. That God would come in to the help of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould come againſt her, with as much ſpeed as Birds are wont to flee to the defence of their young ones, when they ſee them in any danger: Or, 2. That God would with as much affection and tender care and earneſtneſs provide for the ſecuring of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as birds are wont to ſhew toward their young ones, when they flutter over them to ſhelter them; or flee up and down, to beat off thoſe, as well as they can, who they fear would annoy them. So that in this compariſon there may be an alluſion to that which <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.14. is ſaid of the <hi>Aſſyrian's</hi> boaſting of his victories, implying, that tho' he had bragged how he had ſurprized the ſeveral Nations of the Earth as a birds-neſt, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of their riches, none daring to peep or to wag the wing; yet when he came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he ſhould not find it ſo. As for that which follows, <hi>defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo he will deliver it, and paſſing over he will preſerve it;</hi> thoſe words <hi>paſſing over</hi> may be uſed as with reſpect to the ſimilitude he had uſed of <hi>Birds flying,</hi> to ſignifie that Gods Eye would be upon them to preſerve them, according to the care that Birds have of their young ones when they fly this way, and that, over them to ſecure them. Or it may import only the ſuddenneſs of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that God would but paſs over them, and they ſhould be preſently delivered. But moſt generally it is thought by Expoſitors, that in thoſe words there is an alluſion to the deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to wit, that as then an Angel <hi>paſſing over</hi> the Houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in one night ſlay all the firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> So it ſhould be now; an Angel <hi>paſſing over</hi> them ſhould in one night make a mighty Slaughter in the <hi>Aſſyrian's</hi> Camp, and ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be delivered.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Iſrael have deeply revolted.]</hi> That is, You that hope to have a ſhare in this promiſed deliverance, repent and turn unto the Lord, from whom the body of this people (who will yet needs glory in the name of <hi>the children of Iſrael</hi>) have deeply revolted, to wit, as by other heinous ſins, ſo more particularly by your incredulity and forſaking of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42788:170"/>
God, and ſeeking to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help. This expreſſion, that they had <hi>deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted,</hi> we have alſo <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.9. <hi>they have deeply corrupted themſelves:</hi> the meaning whereof is, that they had greatly or extreamly apoſtatiſed from God, as we uſe to ſay, that ſuch a man is <hi>deep</hi> in ſuch a Treaſon, or other Villany, when he hath had a great hand in it. But the drift of this expreſſion here, might be to hint unto them, that though they had thus dangerouſly revolted from God, yet if they would now have been as deep in their ſorrow, as they had formerly been in their ſin, God would remember his covenant made with their fathers, and ſhew them mercy, and own them for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For in that day every man ſhall caſt away his idols of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think, that is mentioned as an effect of their ſincere repentance, upon the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> invading of their Land; or upon the wonderful deſtruction which God would bring upon the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army. But the word <hi>(for)</hi> doth plainly ſhew, that this is added as a motive to preſs them to hearken to the foregoing exhortation to repentance: Repent, ſaith he, and turn to the Lord; <hi>for in that day,</hi> to wit, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall make ſuch havock in your land, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the vanity both of your Idol-worſhip, and of your reſting upon the aid of the <hi>Egyptians, every man ſhall caſt away his idols of ſilver, and his idols of gold</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.18.) <hi>which your own hands have made unto you</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>for a ſin;</hi> that is, that you might therewith ſin againſt God, and thereby draw down his vengeance upon you.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Then ſhall the Aſſyrian fall,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army ſhall be deſtroyed <hi>with the ſword, not of a mighty man; and the ſword, not of a mean man, ſhall devour him;</hi> that is, not by the ſword of any man, one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the ſword of Divine vengeance, laid on by the Miniſtry of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. <hi>but he ſhall flee from the ſword;</hi> that is, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall flee from the ſword from Heaven, wherewith he ſhall find his Army deſtroyed; or, as it is in the margin, <hi>for fear of the ſword,</hi> to wit, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how that havock came to be made in his Army: <hi>and his young men ſhall be diſcomfited;</hi> that is, thoſe of the youth and flower of his Army, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their youth uſe to be moſt hot and furious, and that ſhall eſcape the ſtroke of the Angel, ſhall be glad to flee for their lives. It is in the <hi>Hebrew, and his young men ſhall be for melting;</hi> the meaning thereof muſt needs be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that their <hi>multitude melted away,</hi> as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.16. or that their hearts, through fear, fainted and melted away; ſee the Notes, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.5. As for the Tranſlation in the margin, <hi>and his young men ſhall be tributaries,</hi> I know not what can be probably intended thereby, unleſs it be, that after this defeat the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould in proceſs of time become tributaries to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and ſo afterwards to other Nations. For we do not find, that upon this overthrow of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s great Army, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> became tributaries to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And he ſhall paſs over to his ſtrong hold for fear,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> thus, <hi>And his rock ſhall paſs away for fear:</hi> and therefore ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the place thus, that the remainder of his Army, or his Princes and Commanders (the chief rock and ſtrength whereon he relied), ſhould flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42788:170"/>
for fear. But according to our Tranſlation, the meaning is plain, that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſhould flee into his own Country, and betake himſelf to his ſtrong holds there; or rather to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> his beſt fortified City, not daring to ſtay any where till he came thither, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.36. <hi>and his princes ſhall be afraid of the enſign;</hi> that is, either 1. That they ſhould be afraid, as men are wont to be, when they ſee their enemies marching up againſt them with diſplayed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: Or 2. That they ſhall be ſo afrighted, that if they ſaw an Enſign, though it were when they were come into their own Country, or though it were only ſome Enſign ſet on the top of ſome Watch-tower by the way, they would be afraid, as if ſome Troops of their Enemies were purſuing them: Or 3. rather, that they ſhould be afraid of the Enſign or Standard which God had, as it were, by his Angel lifted up againſt them, when he fought againſt their Army, and made ſuch dreadful havock amongſt them. And then for the laſt words, <hi>his princes ſhall be afraid of the enſign, ſaith the Lord, whoſe fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jeruſalem;</hi> the meaning of that is, either 1. That in that City was the houſe wherein he dwelt continually to wit, the Temple, where he had his fire continually burning upon his Altar; and therefore he would not ſuffer himſelf to be turned out of doors by the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi> Or 2. That there his people were conſtantly waiting upon him in the duties of his worſhip; their ſacrifices and their incenſe were ſtill burning upon his Altar; and that therefore he was engaged in point of Honour to appear for their defence: Or 3. That God was there as a conſuming fire, to burn up the enemies that ſhould come upon them to deſtroy them. As in <hi>Zion</hi> he had his fire and furnace for the trying and purging of his people, ſo alſo for the utter deſtroying of his and their Enemies, againſt whom, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to wrong his people, his vengeance would be ſtill ready to break forth as a devouring fire; ſee the former Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17. and 30.30.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>BEhold, a king ſhall reign in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not certain, whether this be a new Prophecy, diſtinct from that which went before, or whether rather it be not added as a farther ſupplement to that. Many Expoſitors hold, that primarily and literally <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is the <hi>King</hi> here intended; and that as he was a type of Chriſt. But with one conſent, all Chriſtian Expoſitors hold, it is Chriſt that is here principally and myſtically meant under the type of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah.</hi> Taking it to be a diſtinct Prophecy by it ſelf, I ſee not why it might not be prophecied in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> purpoſely to comfort the people under his abominable tyranny, with a promiſe of a better King ſhortly to come;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42788:171"/>
and that therefore this particle of admiration, <hi>Behold,</hi> was prefixed, it being a thing very remarkable, that the Son of ſuch a wicked Father, ſhould prove ſuch a good, juſt and gracious King. But if we do take it as prophecied, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſate already in the Throne, there is no incongruity in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, <hi>Behold, a King ſhall reign in righteouſneſs, and his Princes in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to wit, with reſpect to that far greater care which he and his Princes ſhould take to govern the People with all poſſible righteouſneſs and judgment, after the Lord had wrought that wonderful deliverance for them by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army. But however, moſt exactly and clearly was this accompliſhed in the Lord Chriſt: <hi>Behold, a King ſhall reign in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that is, he ſhall govern his people with perfect righteouſneſs; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6, 7. and 72.1, 2. <hi>and his Princes ſhall rule in judgment;</hi> that is, they that ſhall miniſter unto Chriſt in the Government of his Church, ſhall do it moſt juſtly, according to the Rule of the Goſpel. But ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And a man ſhall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that man before ſpoken of; or more inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and each one of his Princes, ſhall be as a place where one may cover himſelf from the violence of ſome rough wind, or as a haven where ſhips may be ſhelter'd from all damage in great ſtorms and tempeſts. The meaning is, that by the righteous and wiſe government of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and his Princes, the People ſhould be defended from all violence and oppreſſion; and that their government ſhould be as welcome and acceptable to the Subjects, as ſuch a hiding place is wont tribe to men in ſuch tempeſtuous times. Yea, this might be ſpoken with particular reſpect to the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army. For ſuch <hi>a hiding place</hi> was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the poor <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe ſtormy days, when by his prayers he prevailed with God for the breaking of that army; and ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſecured, and the enemies were kept from making ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock all the land over, as they had done in ſome parts of it. And ſo likewiſe the following words ſet forth how chearing and comforting, yea, how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly comfortable this government ſhould be unto them, <hi>as Rivers of water in a dry place,</hi> which do not only moiſten the parched ground, and make it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and fruitful, but alſo yield great refreſhing to the thirſty traveller; that is, the wronged and oppreſſed, who are wont earneſtly to thirſt to have Juſtice done them, ſhall be exceedingly joyed by the relief the Magiſtrate ſhall afford them; <hi>as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. It ſhall be as great a refreſhment to them, as it is to one that travelleth in the ſcorching heat of the Sun thorough a deſert, where there are no houſes or trees to ſhelter him, to get within the hollow cave of ſome great rock, or to ſtand under the ſhadow of it. But now this is principally meant of <hi>the man</hi> Chriſt: He is <hi>a hiding place</hi> by his merits, from the wrath of God, Satan, Sin, Death and Hell. And ſo likewiſe he ſhelters and ſafeguards his people in the windy days of affliction and perſecution, of outward troubles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations, from all dangers and evils, and diſcouraging fears and terrors: He is <hi>as rivers of water in a dry place, as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land;</hi> to wit, in that by his grace he cools and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42788:171"/>
the diſtempered heats of all ſinful paſſions and corruptions in them and refreſh their ſcorched conſciences with the promiſes of the Goſpel, and the comforts of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the eyes of them that ſee, ſhall not be dim; and the ears of them that hear, ſhall hearken.]</hi> That is, they ſhall not be ſpiritually blind and deaf to the hearing of Gods word, as they were before; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.18. (for this is now oppoſed to the judgment before threatned, concerning the blinding their eyes, and deafning their ears, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.9, 10.) And this, I conceive, is principally meant of the enlightning of mind, and teachable frame of Spirit, which Chriſt would work in his people in the days of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>The heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledg,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, They that were heady and raſh (as all fooliſh and unregenerate perſons are, doing inconſiderately whatever their own carnal hearts, or others, as fooliſh as themſelves, ſhall ſuggeſt to them, without ever adviſing, whether it be good or evil, ſafe or perillous), ſhall become underſtanding, prudent and diſcreet perſons. Though none are more hard to be taught than ſuch giddy-headed and raſh perſons, yet even they ſhall learn to be ſerious and well adviſed in all their ways. So that here again, the knowing and underſtanding heart now promiſed, is oppoſed to the fat and ſtupid heart before threatned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10. Yea, and obſervable it is, that the knowledg here promiſed, is aſcribed to the heart: <hi>The heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledg.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and underſtanding of the natural man, is only in his mind and head; but that which is here promiſed, is ſuch as ſhall be accompanied with the fear and love of God, and other holy affections wrought in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the tongue of the ſtammerers ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly.]</hi> Or <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly,</hi> as it is in the margin: That is, They that before were able to ſpeak of the things of God, and the truths of his Word but weakly, and as it were, ſtammeringly and doubtingly, ſhall be then able to ſpeak of them plainly, and fully, and excellently, and withal ſincerely; as when they confeſs their ſins, they ſhall do it freely and fully; and when they make profeſſion of their faith, they ſhall do it clearly and plainly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The vile perſon ſhall be no more called liberal,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious worthleſs man, or the baſe ſordid miſer; which agreeth beſt with that which followeth: <hi>nor the churl ſaid to be bountiful.</hi> The meaning, as many think, is, that in the better part of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign (to wit, when God had delivered <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from that dangerous invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a very dangerous ſickneſs), there ſhould be ſuch a reformation in the land, that ſuch wicked wretches, and covetous churls, ſhould neither 1. be ſoothed up by falſe Prophets in their vile ways, as they had been: Nor 2. be admired, applauded and extolled by the people, as very good men, and <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, bountiful</hi> men, when it was done meerly out of fear or flattrery, becauſe they were rich or great in the world: Or 3. much leſs be advanced to, or continued in places of Honour and Magiſtracy, as it had been in the days of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> of whom it may be ſome had continued too in their places, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42788:172"/>
the former and more unſetled time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign. And the ground of this laſt is, that amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> Princes and men in high places, had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually theſe Titles of Honour given them, <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>bountiful,</hi> and <hi>benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> as we find it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe authority upon them, are called benefactors:</hi> whence it is, that the word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> here tranſlated <hi>liberal,</hi> is often in the Old Teſtament uſed for <hi>Princes,</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.7. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8. But now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, as we muſt, myſtically, of the days of the Goſpel, then the meaning ſeems to be, either as before, that in thoſe days men ſhall be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they are: Vice ſhall not be counted Vertue, nor vicious men be admired and advanced: Or rather, that Chriſt by the Goſpel ſhould ſo clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what is good and what is evil; and ſo powerfully convince the conſciences of men, that the fair ſhews and pretences of wicked men ſhould not ſerve their turn; and that the godly being in eſteem, ſhould have the more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power to reſtrain the petulancy of ungodly men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>For the vile perſon ſhall ſpeak villany,</hi> &amp;c.] In this and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, a Reaſon is given of that in the foregoing verſe, to wit, why vile wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, or baſe covetous churls, ſhould not be admired or extolled as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral bountiful men by the people; or ſhould not be in places of Dignity, and Power, and Authority (eſpecially (ſay ſome) when the Goſpel-light ſhould come to make a clear diſcovery of men); namely, becauſe ſuch perſons would, both by word and deed, make it apparent what they were; no way fit to be ſo admired, or ſo advanced. <hi>For the vile perſon will ſpeak villany;</hi> that is, his tongue will vent the wickedneſs and villany that is in his heart: <hi>and his heart will work iniquity;</hi> that is, in his heart he will be ſtill plotting and contriving wickedneſs and miſchief; <hi>to practice hypocriſie;</hi> that is, even to cover over his wicked practices with fair pretences of Religion and Juſtice, which makes his wickedneſs the more abominable: <hi>and to utter error againſt the Lord;</hi> that is, to pronounce unjuſt ſentences in judgment, or to ſay any thing to cauſe them to be pronounced contrary to the law and command of God. (This, I conceive, is the meaning of this expreſſion. For though thereby might be meant alſo, all his blaſphemous and Atheiſtical ſpeeches againſt God and his Providence, his flouting at Gods Word, and Worſhip, and Prophets, all Religion and Piety, and all prophane ſpeeches, as are with ſuch men; yet I rather think that particular before mentioned is here, at leaſt, principally intended, becauſe this ſuits beſt with that which went before, and that which follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter): <hi>to make empty the ſoul of the hungry; and he will cauſe the drink of the thirſty to fail;</hi> that is, to oppreſs the pooreſt amongſt the people, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave them of thoſe things wherewith their lives ſhould be ſuſtained. Some, I know, do underſtand thoſe words, <hi>and to utter error againſt the Lord,</hi> of the wicked mans ſpreading falſe Doctrines amongſt the people, whereby they are led into error: and accordingly they alſo expound the following words; <hi>to make empty the ſoul of the hungry,</hi> &amp;c. of his with-holding the Doctrine of Life and Salvation from the people, that ſpiritual nouriſhment wherewith their hungry and thirſty ſouls ſhould have been refreſhed. But this is not the uſual ſin of the vile perſon, and the churl, of whom the Prophet is here ſpeaking,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42788:172"/>Ver. 7. <hi>The inſtruments alſo of the Churl are evil,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, All thoſe he imploys as his inſtruments for the effecting of his wicked practiſes, his Servants and Miniſters, are as baſe and vile likewiſe as he is: he makes uſe of no other but ſuch as himſelf is; Or rather, all the tricks and artificial devices and means he uſeth to effect his deſigns, are ſtark naught; for ſo this ſeems to be explained in the following words, <hi>he deviſeth wicked devices to deſtroy the poor with lying words;</hi> that is, By falſe Informations and Witneſſes, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Cenſures, proceedings wherein Juſtice is pretended, when nothing but injuſtice and oppreſſion is intended; <hi>even when the needy ſpeaketh right,</hi> that is, When his cauſe is juſt, and he deſireth and pleadeth nothing in his defence but what is moſt equal and juſt. Indeed this laſt clauſe may be read as it is in the Margin, <hi>when he ſpeaketh againſt the poor in judgment;</hi> and then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That the Churl will not ſtick <hi>to deſtroy the poor with lying words,</hi> even when the poor man ſtands before Judgment ſeat, which ſhould be a Sanctuary for innocent perſons.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>But the liberal deviſeth liberal things,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The charitable man is continually ſtudying and contriving how to do good bountifully; for this is added in oppoſition of what was ſaid before of the covetous Churl, See the Notes before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. Indeed ſome would have it underſtood of ſuch a Prince as really deſerveth the title of bountiful and <hi>liberal.</hi> But it is clear, that our Tranſlators did intend it of all liberal perſons in general; <hi>and by liberal things ſhall he ſtand,</hi> or, <hi>be eſtabliſhed,</hi> that is, The more liberal he is, the ſurer he ſhall ſtand, the more firmly he ſhall be ſetled in a proſperous condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Riſe up, ye Women that are at eaſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing part of the Chapter promiſed a time of mercy and deliverance to the faithful, here the Prophet returns again to threaten the <hi>Jews</hi> with thoſe grievous Calamities that ſhould come upon them, before thoſe comfortable times ſhould come, of which he had now ſpoken, <hi>Riſe up, ye Women that are at eaſe, hear my voice ye careleſs Daughters,</hi> &amp;c. Some by the <hi>Women</hi> here ſpoken to, underſtand the Cities of <hi>Judea;</hi> and by the <hi>Daughters,</hi> the Villages belonging to thoſe Cities. But I ſee not why it ſhould not be underſtood literally of the Women amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thoſe eſpecially that living in great plenty, idleneſs and luxury, were moſt void of all care and fear; for to theſe the Prophet might purpoſely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs his ſpeech; 1. Becauſe ſuch are apt to live moſt at eaſe, and to be moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. 2ly. Becauſe Women are moſt likely to be affrighted with the prediction of approaching Calamities, and would be moſt unable to bear what in ſuch times they were like to endure. And 3ly. eſpecially to imply, the greatneſs of the vengeance that was coming upon them, wherein the very Women ſhould not be ſpared; no, the greateſt or richeſt of them, though beſt provided to make an eſcape, ſhould be able to get out of the enemies hands, but ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the common ſort. As for that expreſſion, <hi>Riſe up ye Women that are at eaſe,</hi> it is uſed to imply, either 1. with what great attention and reverence it was fit they ſhould hearken to what he would ſay to them, as being of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great concernment, and given him in charge by the Lord their God, See the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.18. Or, 2ly. the folly of their ſecurity in a time of ſo great danger. It was no time for them to ſit ſtill; as fearleſs and careleſs as they were, it would not belong ere God would rouze them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:42788:173"/>Ver. 10. <hi>Many days and years ſhall ye be troubled, ye careleſs Women,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ye that are now ſo careleſs and fearleſs, ſhall then be piteouſly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And becauſe it is ſaid of the Judgment here threatned, that it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time <hi>(many days and years)</hi> therefore many Expoſitors hold, That a long ſucceſſion of ſeveral calamities is here intended; and ſo that it muſt not be reſtrained only to <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> invading of <hi>Judea,</hi> and blocking up <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but muſt be extended to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the ſeventy years of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, yea, to the utter deſolation that was afterwards brought upon this land and people by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And indeed ſome of the following paſſages muſt neceſſarily be underſtood in this large extent, <hi>for the vintage ſhall fail, the gathering ſhall not come;</hi> to wit, Either becauſe of the havock the enemy ſhould make in their Country, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould afterward lye deſolate and untilled, and without inhabitants; See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.34.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Tremble ye women that are at eaſe, be troubled ye careleſs ones,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, As fearleſs as ye are now, ye ſhall be troubled and tremble; <hi>Strip ye, and make ye bare, and gird ſackcloth upon your loyns;</hi> that is, put off your ordinary attire, and clothe your ſelves with ſackcloth, as mourners uſe to do: yet this laſt clauſe may be intended as by way of foretelling how they ſhould be uſed by their enemies, when they prevailed over them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>They ſhall lament for the teats,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Becauſe the Womens breaſts (and ſome would extend it alſo to kine and ſheep) were dried up for want of food, and ſo they wanted milk for their little ones. And ſo indeed it was, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> Lam. 4.3, 4. <hi>Even the Sea-monſters draw out the breaſt, they give ſuck to their young ones; the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my people is become cruel, like the Oſtriches in the wilderneſs. The tongue of the ſucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. But yet very many Expoſitors by <hi>the teats</hi> here, do underſtand their fields and vineyards, the two breaſts which did continually yield plenty of nouriſhment to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and thus, ſay they, the Prophet explains himſelf in the following words, <hi>for the pleaſant fields, for the fruitful vine.</hi> But this may be added, as a further cauſe of their ſorrow, to wit, That they ſhould mourn, as for the drineſs of their breaſts, ſo alſo for the want of the fruit of their Fields and Vineyards.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Upon the land of my people ſhall come up thorns and briars,</hi> &amp;c.] The Expreſſion here uſed, ſeems to intend, That the land of <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould be wholly overgrown with briars and thorns, See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.23, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that, notwithſtanding it was the land which God had appointed to be the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his peculiar people; ſo that there was no cauſe upon that account to flatter themſelves that it ſhould not be ſo; <hi>yea upon all the houſes of joy in the joyous City;</hi> that is, even in thoſe places where thoſe gallant houſes ſtand in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.2.) where there is nothing now, but pleaſure, and mirth, and great jolity, ſhall briars and thorns grow up, the houſes themſelves being burnt down by the enemy. And indeed ſome read this laſt clauſe ſo, <hi>burning upon all the houſes of joy in the joyous City;</hi> which how it was accompliſhed when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of their Kings, Princes, and other great men; <hi>the multitude of the City ſhall be left,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, They ſhall be left without a King or other Princes to defend them. But there is rather here an inverſion of words, <hi>the multitude of the City ſhall be left,</hi> for <hi>the City ſhall be left of its multitude,</hi> according to that ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.1. <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary that was full of people!</hi> See the Notes alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.11, 12. <hi>The forts and towers,</hi> (or <hi>the clifts and watch-towers</hi>) of which ſee the Note 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.3. <hi>ſhall be for dens for ever,</hi> that is, For a long time, as indeed during the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity it was ſo for ſeventy years; <hi>a joy of wild aſſes,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.21. <hi>a paſture of flocks,</hi> ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Until the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.] By affixing this period to the deſolation before threatned, the Prophet returns again to the comforting of his faithful Servants. This deſolation ſhall be in the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high,</hi> that is, Until God from heaven do by his quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, abundantly poured forth upon us, reſtore his people to a comfortable and flouriſhing eſtate and condition. And this ſeems to import, 1. That whereas they were in as hopeleſs a condition, as ſo many dead men (as it is ſaid of them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.6. <hi>He hath ſet me in dark places, as they that be dead of old</hi>) God would breathe a ſpirit of life into them, and quicken them again; which is that <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> foretold in his Prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. concerning the Reſurrection of the dead and dry bones. 2ly. That whereas they were like trees or plants that ſeem in winter to be quite dead, God would make them alive again, and cauſe all things to be with them in a flouriſhing condition again, as it is with the Creatures, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 104.30. <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou reneweſt the face of the earth;</hi> concerning which, ſee the Note there. And 3ly. That whereas they were ſpiritually dead in ſin, God would by his ſpirit of Grace revive and quicken them, and make them a holy people: So that as the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before threatned may be underſtood to have been accompliſhed gradually at ſeveral times; (See the Note before) ſo this period ſet for the reviving of them again by the pouring forth of the ſpirit upon them from on high, may be underſtood likewiſe of ſeveral times; as 1. partly of the reviving and the reformation of the ſtate of <hi>Judea</hi> in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> days, after God had ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deſtroyed <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army. Or, 2ly. more fully and clearly of that ſtrange quickning and reviving of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, when that people were ſet free out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and coming home again to their own Country, <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was rebuilt and reinhabited with multitudes of people as in former times: Or, 3ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and principally, of the glorious change that was wrought in the Church in the days of the Goſpel, when God did ſo abundantly pour forth of his Spirit, firſt upon the Apoſtles, and afterwards upon the whole body of his people that embraced the faith of Chriſt according to that promiſe, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs afterward, that I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Church did ſpring up and flouriſh again after an unuſual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted manner. As for that which is mentioned in the following words, as the effect of this pouring forth of Gods Spirit upon them; <hi>and the wilderneſs be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a foreſt,</hi> See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.17. underſtanding it of Goſpel-times, the meaning ſeems to be,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42788:174"/>
That after that plentiful effuſion of Gods Spirit upon his people, thoſe that were before as a barren wilderneſs, ſhall become fruitful; and they that before had ſome beginnings of Grace wrought in them, ſhould bring forth fruits in ſuch abundance, that their former life ſhould ſeem but as a wilderneſs, where no fruits were.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Then judgment ſhall dwell in the wilderneſs, and righteouſneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the fruitful field.]</hi> That is, Juſtice ſhall be duly executed, and men ſhall carry themſelves juſtly towards thoſe with whom they converſe (which alſo implies the true fear of God) all the land over; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.17. But if we will take it as ſpoken myſtically concerning the days of the Goſpel, then the meaning ſeems to be, that both amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were as a barren wilderneſs, and among the <hi>Jews</hi> that had been for many years his peculiar fruitful field, where he was only known and worſhipped, when they were gathered into the Church of Chriſt, both the righteouſneſs of faith and the righteouſneſs of works ſhould be continually found.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace; and the effect of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.]</hi> That is, The fruit of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs amongſt Gods people, ſhall be all manner of peace (inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with God and with men, as far as is good for them), and ſo withal a quiet recumbency upon God, in the aſſurance of his love and provident care over them; and that not for ſome little while only, as it is with the peace of the wicked, but conſtantly and <hi>for ever;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.2, 3. and 119.165.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places.]</hi> That is, By reaſon of Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they ſhall dwell ſafely and without fear wherever they are: ſee the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.33.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>When it ſhall hail, coming down on the foreſt,</hi> &amp;c.] This, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Tranſlation, muſt be referred to that which was ſaid in the two foregoing verſes, to wit, thus, that Gods people ſhould enjoy that peace and ſafety there promiſed, even <hi>when it ſhall hail, coming down on the foreſt;</hi> that is, when the judgments of God ſhall be poured forth upon the Heathens, or the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the world round about them, that were as a wild and fruitleſs foreſt. But yet, they that underſtand the foregoing promiſes of the peace and quietneſs of ſpirit which Chriſtians ſhould enjoy in the days of the Goſpel, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly alſo underſtand this, <hi>when it ſhall hail, coming down on the foreſt,</hi> either of a ſtorm of divine wrath, that ſhould then fall upon the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had been Gods fruitful field, but were then become a foreſt: Or elſe myſtically, that whilſt true Believers enjoyed ſuch wonderful peace, the Goſpel ſhould pour forth a ſtorm of dreadful terrors and vengeance upon the conſciences of thoſe to whom it ſhould prove a ſavour of death unto death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. As for the next clauſe, If we read it, as it is in the margin, <hi>and the city ſhall be utterly abaſed,</hi> then the intendment of it muſt be the ſame with that which went before; to wit, either that Gods people ſhould be ſafe and fearleſs, when the Cities of Gods and his peoples
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42788:174"/>
enemies, or <hi>Babylon</hi> in particular, ſhould be utterly ruined; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.5. or that the Church of Chriſt ſhould enjoy the peace promiſed them, when other places ſhould be like Cities levelled with the ground. But if we read it, as it is in our Bibles, <hi>and the city ſhall be low in a low place,</hi> the words ſeem to be added as a farther illuſtration of the ſafety and peace of Gods people; namely, that they ſhould not need to build their Cities on high and ſteep places, as men uſe to do, that they may be made the more defenſible, becauſe even in thoſe Cities that were in Plains and Valleys, and ſeemed to lye moſt open to invaſion, they ſhould be, through Gods protection, ſafe and without all fear of danger.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that ſow beſide all waters,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, 1. literally, as ſpoken by way of admiring the great plenty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Prophet foreſaw God would bleſs the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> after thoſe times of peace, of which he had now prophecied: <hi>Bleſſed are ye that ſow beſide all waters:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Happy ſhall they be that ſhall live to ſee that day, when your land, that was waſted by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or that lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grown with briars and thorns, during the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, ſhall be ſo fruitful, that it ſhall yield as rich Crops to thoſe that ſow their ſeed therein, as thoſe grounds uſually do, that lye by great Rivers, or are any way beſt watered; <hi>that ſend forth thither the feet of the ox and the aſs,</hi> to wit, to till, and plow, and harrow the Grounds; and ſo to fit them for the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeed in them, or to tread out their Corn, after it is reaped, with <hi>the feet</hi> of thoſe Cattel: Or the meaning may be, that their land ſhould yield them ſuch plenty of Corn, that they ſhould not need to ſpare it to grow up for Harveſt; but ſhould turn out their Cattel to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed in their Corn-fields, as in their Paſture-grounds; or at leaſt, that they ſhould put in their Cattel to crop it for a time, becauſe it ſhould grow up ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rank. But 2. It may be underſtood myſtically, as ſpoken with reſpect to Goſpel-times: <hi>Bleſſed are ye that ſow beſide all waters, that ſend forth thither the feet of the ox and the aſs:</hi> that is, Bleſſed ſhall they be, that ſhall in thoſe days be ſent forth to ſow the ſeed of the Goſpel; and that becauſe they ſhall, to their great joy, find the hearts of the people, where their ſeed is ſown, to be as fat and well watered ground, that ſhall bring forth fruit abundantly. Some indeed, by ſowing <hi>beſide all waters,</hi> do underſtand, ſowing the ſeed of the Goſpel among all Nations. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is only the fruitfulneſs of the ſoil that is implied by that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WO to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled: and dealeſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> and the rather, becauſe the ſame words, in a manner, are before ſpoken of the <hi>Babylonians:</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.2. But it is rather the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and it may be <hi>Sennacherib</hi> particularly, over whom the Prophet doth here inſult, denouncing a War againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had waſted and deſtroyed ſo many Countries, and of late the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being no way provoked thereto by any injury which thoſe Nations had offered to them; and becauſe they had dealt perfidiouſly with thoſe that had no way dealt ſo with them. And this laſt ſome would have to be purpoſely added, with reſpect to <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s proceeding on to waſte the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> after he had taken a great ſum of money of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> to withdraw his Army. But for that ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.7, 14, 17. The wo denounced is ſet forth in the following words: <hi>when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled; and when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treacherouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee:</hi> that is, when God ſhall put an end to thy rapine and treachery, the ſame ſhall be done to thee which thou haſt formerly done to others. And that which is ſaid of others dealing treacherouſly with him, may be looked upon as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was ſlain by his own Sons, as he was worſhipping in the houſe of <hi>Nizroch</hi> his God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 29.37.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>O Lord, be gracious unto us,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet having foretold the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or other the enemies of Gods people, doth here ſuddenly, as not able any longer to contain himſelf, break forth into a prayer, either as in his own name, or the name of the Church in general, deſiring the ſpeedy performance of that deſtruction upon the enemy which he had now foretold. And this he doth, as foreſeeing the great miſery and danger his people would be in, until this deliverance came; and withal, as acknowledging the juſt hand of God therein upon them; and ſhewing, that it was by praying unto God for mercy, that the deliverance promiſed muſt be obtained: <hi>O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee:</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.17. <hi>be thou their arm;</hi> that is, their mighty defence and ſtrength for the ſubduing of their enemies; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.21. <hi>every morning;</hi> that is, conſtantly, and without delay; ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 7.17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.14. <hi>our ſalvation alſo in the time of trouble;</hi> to wit, ſay ſome, as thou haſt been to thy people in former times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:42788:175"/>Ver. 3. <hi>At the noiſe of the tumult the people fled,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again to ſpeak of the deſtruction threatned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. ſpeaking of that which was to be, as if it were done already. Some underſtand it of the tumult raiſed amongſt the <hi>Babylonians</hi> by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> when they ruined that great Monarchy. But the moſt of Expoſitors by far, underſtand it of the ruine of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.36. <hi>At the noiſe of the tumult the people fled,</hi> that is, At the noiſe of the tumult raiſed in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp, when the Angel came upon them in ſuch a dreadful manner (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.30.) and ſtruck them with a pannick fear, and made ſuch a ſlaughter amongſt them; they that were not yet ſlain, fled away; <hi>at the lifting up of thy ſelf,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, When thou didſt aſcend thy Tribunal to pronounce ſentence of Judgment againſt them, or when thou didſt appear in thy mighty power to execute vengeance upon them, having before ſeemed to ſit ſtill, and not to mind them; <hi>the Nations were ſcattered,</hi> to wit, the ſeveral Nations that ſerved in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army. But ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And your ſpoil,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The ſpoil which you, O <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> have plundered and taken away from other Nations, like ſo many Caterpillers, devouring all things where you come, and whereof you alſo are now like to be ſpoiled; Or, the ſpoil which you the people of God ſhall find in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp, <hi>ſhall be gathered like the gathering of the Caterpillers;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, As eaſily as the Caterpillers do gather and eat up all green things where they come. But rather the meaning is, That the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould gather up the ſpoil in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp, with as much eaſe, and in as great abundance, as Country-people, even Children amongſt others, are wont to gather Caterpillers in a time when they abound, and to throw them in great heaps into pits, which they have digged for the burying of them; <hi>as the running to and fro of locuſts, ſhall he run upon them;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, As the locuſts run to and fro in the fields, eating up, and deſtroying all as they go, ſo ſhall the Angel of the Lord break through the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, making dreadful havock amongſt them wherever he comes. But rather this alſo is ſpoken of the ſpoils before mentioned; and ſo the words are to be underſtood thus, <hi>as the running to and fro of locuſts, ſhall he run upon them;</hi> that is, As when God ſends a Plague of Locuſts upon any place, the inhabitants are wont with much eagerneſs to get out from every houſe, old and young, and to run up and down in their Gardens, Fields, and Vineyards, and gather up and deſtroy innumerable multitudes of theſe harmful Creatures; ſo ſhall every one of the <hi>Jews</hi> run up and down in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to gather up the ſpoils they ſhall find there; Or rather, (for that ſuits beſt with the Expreſſion here uſed, <hi>as the running to and fro of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts</hi>) As the Locuſts run to and fro in the field, ſo ſhall each man that goeth out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> run up and down to gather what ſpoils he can find in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The Lord is exalted,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He will be exalted, to wit, by the dreadful Judgment which he will execute upon the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11. <hi>for he dwelleth on high,</hi> and ſo hath all things both in heaven and earth under his command, and can therefore deſtroy the great ones of the World when ever he pleaſeth; ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>He hath filled Zion
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42788:176"/>
with Judgment and righteouſneſs,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will there abundantly diſcover, That he is a juſt and a righteous God, by delivering his people according to his promiſe, and executing Judgment upon his and their enemies; and they ſhall every where extol God for theſe things. Or, by theſe things he will cauſe <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was formerly full of all injuſtice and unrighteouſneſs, to abound with judgment and righteouſneſs; to wit, in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when this ſhall be done, See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.16. yet this may be extended alſo to the days of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy times, and ſtrength of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thy times, <hi>O Hezekiah!</hi> for here the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet directs his ſpeech as if he had been ſpeaking to him, in whoſe days the great things now foretold were to be done. And the meaning is, That the true Wiſdom and ſaving Knowledg of God that ſhould abound in his times, and more eſpecially his own particular Wiſdom and Knowledge, and the exerciſe thereof in that pious and prudent managing the affairs of the Realm, ſhould be the means to eſtabliſh the peace and proſperous condition of their ſtate, and a ſtrong ſafeguard to them in every regard, during his reign; which agreeth with that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 2 King. 20.19. <hi>Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?</hi> And indeed in his Son <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s days all fell into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion again; <hi>the fear of the Lord is his treaſure,</hi> that is, His piety and care for the worſhip of God ſhall be dearer to him, than any Treaſure; Or, he ſhall be in this regard, richer than any Treaſures could make him; yea it ſhall be the means too of advancing his Wealth exceedingly; See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Behold, their valiant ones,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet doth here ſet forth the ſad condition wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be, before God deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army; thereby the more to magnifie the greatneſs and the ſeaſonableneſs of the following deliverance; and withal to fore-arm the faithful againſt their being overmuch diſheartned, when they ſhould ſee the land brought into ſuch diſtreſs; <hi>Their valiant ones ſhall cry without,</hi> that is, Their valiant Gariſon-ſoulders ſhall with a loud voice, and that openly in the very ſtreets, bewail their extream danger. Or, (if we read it, as it is in the Margin) <hi>their meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall cry without,</hi> that is, Either the Meſſengers which the King and State of <hi>Judah</hi> did at firſt ſend to <hi>Sennacherib</hi> to deſire terms of peace from him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.14. or thoſe they ſent afterward to <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> to parley with him, and to ſee if they could any way appeaſe him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. ſhall without the City, as they return back, or in publick in the ſtreets, cry out for very anguiſh of ſpirit, becauſe of the ſucceſleſneſs of all their endeavours, and the deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their dangers. And thus this firſt clauſe is the ſame with that which follows, <hi>the Ambaſsadors of peace,</hi> that is, That were ſent to ſee if they could make peace; (and ſome add too, That they were men that were all for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace with the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and that they did at firſt bring back word, that there was great hope of peace, to wit, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> agreed to ſtay his hand upon condition of their paying him a certain ſum of money, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.14.) <hi>ſhall weep bitterly,</hi> to wit, when they ſhall ſee all their endeavours come to nothing: which how it was accompliſhed, we may ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.37.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42788:176"/>
where it is ſaid, that theſe Meſſengers returned to <hi>Hezekiah with their clothes rent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The high-ways lye waſte,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be taken as the ſad report, which the Meſſengers before mentioned, ſent to <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> made of the miſerable condition wherein the land lay, or as a further relation hereof by the Prophet, <hi>The high-ways lye waſte, the way-faring man ceaſeth,</hi> to wit, no man daring to travel in the common roads, becauſe they were ſo peſtered with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſouldiers; See the Note, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.6. <hi>he hath broken the Covenant,</hi> that is, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> hath broken the Covenant he made with us. And this I conceive he is charged with, not ſo much becauſe the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and particularly <hi>Ahaz</hi> the Father of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> had made a Covenant with the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> that he ſhould help the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt their enemies, as becauſe he had agreed with them at this very time, that upon the payment of ſuch a ſum of money by way of Compoſition, which himſelf aſſigned, he would withdraw his Army; and yet when he had gotten the money from them, he proceeded in the ſame hoſtile manner againſt them, as he did before; for which ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.14, 17. I know ſome would have this underſtood of the people of <hi>Judah's</hi> breaking Covenant with God; and others would have it to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the people concerning Gods breaking Covenant with them. But it is clear the Prophet ſpeaks this of the <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> and ſo likewiſe that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>he hath deſpiſed the Cities,</hi> to wit, in that in a boaſting way he ſlighted their ſtrength, and rejected their Meſſengers when they ſued to him for peace, and made nothing of deſtroying them utterly, and levelling them with the ground, not caring to preſerve them for himſelf or his people; <hi>he regardeth no man,</hi> that is, He neither fears any man, nor pitieth any man, but as a man void of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity makes havock of all where he comes. And it may be, as ſome think, that in this laſt clauſe the Prophet had particular reſpect to <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> ſpeaking ſo reproachfully of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and to the ſcorn he put upon his Nobles, when having received that great ſum of money of them, which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had ſent him for the purchaſe of his peace, he ſent them away in a diſgraceful manner, without doing that which he had promiſed; See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.14, 17, 22. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>The earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The whole land of <hi>Judea, mourneth and languiſheth,</hi> to wit, as being laid waſte by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Lebanon is aſhamed and hewn down,</hi> that is, It is aſhamed becauſe all her lofty trees are hewn down; <hi>Sharon</hi> (See the Note, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>is like a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> to wit, as being in a manner wholly left deſolate without man or beaſt; <hi>and Baſhan and Carmel ſhake off their fruits,</hi> that is, They are as a tree that is left bare, and hath loſt her fruit by reaſon of the great waſte the enemy hath made there. The end of the Prophet in naming theſe particular places, was certainly to imply, That all the moſt goodly and fruitful places in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould be thus deſtroyed. And if that could be made good which ſome ſay, That <hi>Lebanon</hi> was in the utmoſt North parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Carmel</hi> in the South, <hi>Baſan</hi> in the Eaſt, and <hi>Sharon</hi> in the Weſt; we might well think, that theſe places were purpoſely ſingled out to ſhew that the whole land ſhould be left deſolate and waſte. Some indeed ſay, That the two laſt here named, were not in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> but in that of the ten Tribes; and therefore
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42788:177"/>
hold, that by <hi>Baſhan</hi> and <hi>Carmel</hi> here, are figuratively meant, the exceeding fruitful and pleaſant places in <hi>Judea,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Baſhan</hi> and <hi>Carmel</hi> were. But it is clear, that there was a <hi>Baſhan</hi> in <hi>Judah</hi>'s portion; See the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.2. And then beſides, conſidering that the whole Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been already deſtroyed in a great meaſure by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the Prophets aim being to ſhew, that the whole land God had given to be the portion of his people, ſhould be thus over-run, it is no wonder, though ſome places are named that were in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Now will I riſe, ſaith the Lord; now will I be exalted, now will I lift up my ſelf.]</hi> That is, <hi>Now,</hi> that my people are brought into ſuch ſeeming deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate extremities, and <hi>now</hi> their enemies are grown ſo exceeding inſolent, <hi>now</hi> will I ariſe and glorifie my ſelf in the deſtruction of their enemies; ſee the foregoing Notes, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Ye ſhall conceive chaff, ye ſhall bring forth ſtubble,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken to the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And the words may be underſtood two ſeveral ways, either, 1. that the Plots which they had conceived againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods people, were fooliſh, and the event ſhould be accordingly vain and to no purpoſe, like <hi>chaff</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> nothing worth, as if they had ſown <hi>chaff,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> had grown up inſtead of Corn. Or elſe 2. that their deſigns againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould prove the occaſion of their own utter ruine. <hi>Chaff</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> are very combuſtible matter: and therefore by ſaying they ſhould <hi>conceive chaff,</hi> and <hi>bring forth ſtubble,</hi> is meant, that they ſhould plot and bring forth that which ſhould be the means of conſuming them. And hereto agrees that which follows; <hi>your breath, as fire, ſhall devour you:</hi> that is, as a man by blowing, kindles a fire; ſo you by the rage which you breathe forth againſt God and againſt his people, ſhall by provoking Gods wrath againſt you, bring deſtruction upon you; and ſo the fire which you thought to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for the burning of others, ſhall conſume your ſelves; ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 15.35.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the people ſhall be as the burnings of lime,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As hard Chalk-ſtones are burnt in Kilnes till they become Lime, ſo ſhall the Lord conſume the ſtouteſt of the Soldiers that ſerve in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army: <hi>as thorns cut up ſhall they be burnt in the fire;</hi> that is, they ſhall be eaſily and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly deſtroyed, even <hi>as thorns,</hi> not growing and green, but <hi>cut up</hi> and ſeare, will ſoon take fire, and are ſpeedily burnt and conſumed; which is meant of the ſudden deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.4, 11. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Hear ye that are far off, what I have done,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be meant of thoſe Nations that dwelt in Countries far remote from <hi>Judea,</hi> to whom the report ſhould be brought of this great work of God, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and delivering <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And then in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe, <hi>and ye that are near, acknowledg my might;</hi> by thoſe <hi>that are near,</hi> is meant, thoſe neighbouring Nations that being nearer to them, might have fuller and clearer information and aſſurance of what God had done. Or elſe by thoſe <hi>that are far off,</hi> may be meant all foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and by them <hi>that are near,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> that were eye-witneſſes of this
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42788:177"/>
work of wonder. The drift of theſe words is to imply, that the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which God would execute upon the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſhould be talked of with admiration, far and near, all the world over; ſee the like expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrites,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thoſe wicked wretches in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that profeſſing themſelves Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had yet formally ſlighted and derided Gods Prophets when they foretold the Judgments that were coming upon them. When the evil threatned did come upon them, then theſe ſecure men were overwhelmed with terrors; <hi>who among us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> And ſome think they are ſuppoſed to ſpeak this upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that dreadful ſlaughter which the Angel of the Lord did in one night make in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. which many hold was done by thunder and lightning from Heaven; to wit, that being terrified herewith, as being conſcious to themſelves of their own diſobedience and rebellions againſt that great God that had done this, they began to think how dangrous it was for them that muſt enjoy conſtant communion with a God that was ſo zealous of his glory, ſo ſevere againſt ſinners, and ſo continually ready to break forth in his wrath as a conſuming fire to devour them here; yea, and to puniſh them with <hi>everlaſting burnings</hi> in hell heareafter: <hi>who among us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſhall dwell with that devouring fire?</hi> &amp;c. But I rather think, that this is intended concerning the terrors wherewith theſe <hi>ſinners in Zion</hi> ſhould be ſurpriſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the marching of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet withall, this muſt be added, that <hi>the fire</hi> wherewith theſe wicked wretches profeſs themſelves to be ſo exceedingly frighted, was not ſimply the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, as conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they would come and burn the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and lay all waſte before them, as they had done wherever they came: but the wrath of God (who upon this ground is indeed called <hi>a conſuming fire;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24.) breaking forth, and clearly diſcovering it ſelf in this invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and their carrying all before them with unreſiſtable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which as it had before conſumed the Ten Tribes, and at this time a great part of the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſo their guilty conſciences made them apprehend it would now likewiſe devour them in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and would never leave burning, till all was conſumed by it: <hi>who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> And indeed it is evident, that by <hi>everlaſting burnings</hi> here, the fire of Hell cannot be meant, becauſe in the following verſe it is ſaid, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man ſhall without fear dwell with this fire; <hi>He that walketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,</hi> &amp;c. It was, I ſay, the wrath and vengeance of God in the fury of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which theſe ſinners feared would be a conſuming fire to them: And obſervable it is, that in this their complaint, they charge all their danger upon Gods extream ſeverity, and not upon themſelves.</p>

or injury to be offered to the life or livelyhood of his brethren; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. <hi>and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil:</hi> that is, from the ſight of any thing that ſhould entice him to evil; or that is ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil himſelf, that he cannot endure to ſee others do it. This is the anſwer that is returned to that doleful exclamation of the wicked diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hypocrites amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in the foregoing verſe: <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire?</hi> &amp;c. Why, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly,</hi> &amp;c. He that will live a holy righteous life, may ſafely dwell with God, though he be <hi>a conſuming fire</hi> to wicked ungodly wretches. And thus he gives them to underſtand, that if the wrath of God were ſo terrible to them, they muſt charge it upon their own wickedneſs, not upon Gods ſeverity. A good and a righteous man needs not fear it.</p>
               <p>Ver 16. <hi>He ſhall dwell on high: his place of defence ſhall be the muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of rocks,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Such a man ſhall be as ſafe and as fearleſs, as if he dwelt in ſome impregnable Fort, built upon inacceſſible Rocks: the Church of God ſhall be as munitions of Rocks to him: <hi>bread ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, his waters ſhall be ſure;</hi> that is, he ſhall not want meat and drink, nor any thing neceſſary for the ſupport of his life, no not in the time when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] This is a farther promiſe made to the righteous man, of whom the Prophet had ſpoken in the two foregoing verſes. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty;</hi> that is, <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Though he may be for a time in a very ſad and forlorn condition (as he was indeed when the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had waſted the greateſt part of his Kingdom, and he was glad to crouch to an inſolent Tyrant, and beg Conditions of Peace of him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.14. and yet could not prevail, but was only abuſed and ſcorned by him, and at laſt beſieged by his Forces in the City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and when upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he went up to the Temple to implore Gods help, having rent his clothes, and covered himſelf with ſackcloth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.1.) yet ſhall he afterwards Reign in greater Majeſty and Glory than ever he did formerly; to wit, after God had ſo miraculouſly deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, after which it is ſaid, that <hi>many brought preſents to Hezekiah, ſo that he was magnified in the ſight of all nations from thenceforth,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.23. <hi>they,</hi> that is, thine eyes, <hi>ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the land that is very far off.</hi> The meaning is, that the time ſhould come when they ſhould no longer be cooped up in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe the beſiegers being all deſtroyed, they might ſafely and ſecurely go abroad whither they would, and travel peaceably into the remoteſt parts of the land; yea, if their occaſions did ſo require, into foreign Countries. Many learned Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do otherwiſe, I know, underſtand this laſt clauſe; as 1. that they ſhould ſee Embaſſadors come to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from a far Country, to wit, the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> for which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.12. Or 2. that they ſhould ſee <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Kingdom enlarged, by the bringing of foreign Countries under his Dominion. Or 3. that the Fame of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould be carried into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries a far off. But the words of the Text will very hardly bear either of theſe Expoſitions. And ſo likewiſe that which others ſay, that in this whole
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42788:178"/>
verſe the Prophet ſpeaks to <hi>Shebna</hi> (of whom mention was made before, <hi>Chap</hi> 22.15.) telling him, that he ſhould ſee <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whom he ſlighted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, Reigning in great Majeſty and Glory; and that himſelf ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, or carried away Captive into a land a far off, it no way ſuits with the tenor of that which the Prophet is ſpeaking of in this place. That which others ſay is far more probable, to wit, that under the type of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the ſeeing of Chriſt in his Glory is here promiſed to the faithful. Though for a time he ſhould live in a low and deſpiſed condition, and ſhould at laſt be hanged up between two Thieves upon the Croſs (when that was fully ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.2. <hi>he hath no form nor comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him</hi>), yet afterwards the eyes of his Servants ſhould ſee this their King in his Beauty and Glory, to wit, when as the only begotten Son of God, he roſe triumphantly out of the Grave, and aſcended into Heaven: but eſpecially when he ſhall come again at the laſt day in exceeding great Glory, ſitting on his Throne to judg the world. As for that of their ſeeing <hi>the land that is very far off,</hi> ſome underſtand it of the enlarging of Chriſts Kingdom, even to the remoteſt parts of the world; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their ſeeing the land of reſt, which in the higheſt Heavens God hath provided for the inheritance of his people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Thine heart ſhall meditate terror,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt, This may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the terrors wherewith they ſhould be perplexed, whilſt the City <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhould be blocked up by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (the Prophet putting them in mind hereof, purpoſely to render them the more thankful for the following deliverance); to wit, that in that time of danger their minds ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually running upon thoſe things, the thought whereof muſt needs be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; as namely, either that they ſhould be ſtill thinking of the heavy preſſures and Taxes that would be put upon them, when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the City, and brought them into bondage. And ſo the words following may be added, to repreſent the fear they ſhould be ſtill in of theſe exactors coming upon them, to peel them of what they had: <hi>Where is the Scribe?</hi> to wit, the Officer that kept the Roul of the Captives, and of the Tribute and Taxes they were to pay: <hi>where is the receiver?</hi> that is, he that gathered the Tribute or Taxes: <hi>where is he that counted the towers?</hi> that is, the Officer that was to take a ſurvey of the houſes, that ſo taking notice of the faireſt and ſtatelieſt houſes, he might ſet the greater Taxes upon them: Or elſe, that they ſhould be continually muſing with themſelves, how little hope there was that they ſhould be able to defend the City againſt ſo mighty an Army, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Soldiers to muſter, nor Money to pay them, nor Forts fitted to keep off the Enemy: <hi>where is the Scribe?</hi> or, as we ſay, the Muſter-maſter: <hi>where is the receiver?</hi> that is, the Treaſurer or Pay-maſter, that is to pay the Soldiers: <hi>where is he that counted the towers?</hi> that is, the Officer that is to take a view of the Towers, and other parts of the City, that by pulling down ſome, and fortifying others, the City might be made the more defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.10. But 2. It may be likewiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (and I think more probably) of their calling to mind, after God had deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the terrors wherewith they had been formerly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42788:179"/>
                  <hi>Thine heart ſhall meditate terrors,</hi> that is, When God hath cut off thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that were ſuch a terror to thee, then thou ſhalt often with ſome content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſit meditating on thoſe terrors, which in thoſe times of thy diſtreſs were ſo dreadful to thee. And accordingly the words following, <hi>Where is the Scribe?</hi> &amp;c. may either be taken as a repreſentation of the deſpairing Speeches they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered when they were ſo diſtracted with fear, according to the Expoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given of them; Or elſe, as an inſultation over thoſe enemies that had a while ſince been ſuch a terror to them; <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is the Receiver?</hi> that is, Where are your Muſter-maſters, and your Pay-maſters? <hi>where is he that counted the towers?</hi> that is, the Engineer, whoſe office it was to view the towers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſo order might be given againſt which part of the City their batteries might be made; or what Towers or Galleries were to be raiſed in the Camp, for the battering and aſſaulting them; as if it had been ſaid, What is now become of all the great Officers in <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army? they are all now gone, and ſhall be no more a terror to us, as it follows in the next verſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it improbable, that the Apoſtle doth at leaſt allude to this place in that Expreſſion of his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee a fierce people,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, This fierce people the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> God will deſtroy and ſcatter, ſo that thou ſhalt be quite rid of them, neither ſhall they return any more to be a trouble and a terror to thee; <hi>a people of a deeper ſpeech than thou canſt perceive, of a ſtammering tongue, that thou canſt not underſtand;</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.11. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Look upon Zion,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing verſe aſſured the faithful <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſhould never more ſee thoſe enemies that were ſuch a terror to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> here he triumphs in the preſervation of that City, <hi>Look upon Zion the City of our ſolemnities,</hi> that is, The City where God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his people to meet together to worſhip him in a ſolemn manner; <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation,</hi> that is, Free from the diſturbances that were formerly therein, the inhabitans living ſafely, and without fear; <hi>a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle that ſhall not be taken down,</hi> to wit, as other tents and tabernacles uſed to be, and then to be removed to other places. And therefore we muſt know, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is called <hi>a Tabernacle,</hi> with reſpect to Gods dwelling there in the Temple, in the ſame manner as formerly he did in the Tabernacle made by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and withal to imply, that though it were in it ſelf a weak place, that might as eaſily be deſtroyed, as a Tabernacle may be taken down; yet through Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſhould be preſerved, as being choſen of God to be his ſetled dwelling place unto the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> See the Notes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.68, 69. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.3. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>not one of the ſtakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken.</hi> But now under this type of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the perpetual peace and ſafety of the Church of Chriſt is intended, that therein Gods people ſhall enjoy a peaceable and quiet habitation, See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. That God would ſo preſerve it here in this World, that the gates of Hell ſhould never be able to prevail againſt it; and that at laſt ſhe ſhould be triumphantly ſetled in an unchangable eſtate of happineſs in Heaven. The Tabernacle of the earthly <hi>Zion</hi> was removed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He hath violently taken away his Tabernacle, as if it were of a Garden;</hi>

it is in Heaven only that God hath promiſed his people a continuing City.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and ſtreams,</hi> &amp;c.] As if the Prophet had ſaid, Though <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be not compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with any great River, as <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and many other Cities are, but hath only a ſmall brook or two for the watering of it, yet that ſhall be no hinderance to our preſervation, becauſe the Lord is with us, and he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>For the Lord is our Judge,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he hath taken us to be his peculiar Covenant people, and therefore as our ſupreme Lord he will ſurely protect us. And obſervable it is, that looking upon this as a ſure ground of comfort, he repeats it in a triumphant manner three ſeveral times, <hi>the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King;</hi> and then concludes, <hi>he will ſave us;</hi> that is, As our Soveraign he will ſafe guard us, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Loyal to him, and live in obedience to his Laws.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Thy tacklings are looſed,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſaid ver. 21. That God would be as a broad river about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> through which no ſhip or galley ſhould be able to paſs, to do them any miſchief; here now, keeping to the former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, he addreſſeth his ſpeech to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or in particular to <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi> as to one that was coming in ſome great gallioun, or with ſome huge navy of ſhips againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> aſſuring them that they ſhould be all certainly ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked and deſtroyed; <hi>Thy tacklings are looſed,</hi> that is, Unfaſtened, or broken, Or, (reading it as it is in the Margin) <hi>They have forſaken thy tacklings,</hi> that is, The mariners mind not thy tacklings; <hi>they could not well ſtrengthen their maſt, they could not ſpread the ſail;</hi> that is, The tacklings being looſe and broken, could neither keep up the maſt ſteady and upright, nor ſpread or turn the ſail, as occaſion required. The drift of all theſe Expreſſions is to make known to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that their condition ſhould be juſt like that of a ſhip, when the Mariners, deſparing of ſafety, do give over all care of ordering their tacklings; or where tacklings, and maſt, and ſails are uſeleſs and broken, and ſo the ſhip muſt needs be driven up and down by the wind and waves, till at laſt it be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of the Sea; that is, They ſhould be all certainly broken in pieces and deſtroyed: <hi>then is the prey of a great ſpoil divided,</hi> that is, Then ſhall the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> go forth and ſeize upon the ſpoil of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp, even as when ſome great ſhip is caſt away, that was laden with rich Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; the people that dwell on the coaſts where this is done, are wont to make a prey of all that by the Sea is driven on ſhore. And it is called a great ſpoil, partly becauſe of the multitude of them that were ſlain by the Angel in the Camp, <hi>an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand,</hi> 2 King. 19.35. and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had before that waſted and plundered in a manner the whole land of <hi>Judea; the lame take the prey;</hi> the moſt impotent among them ſhall be able to take the ſpoil; there ſhall be no difficulty in it, the enemy being all fled or lying dead before them; See the Note, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And the inhabitants ſhall not ſay, I am ſick,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, None of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall have the leaſt cauſe to complain of any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or weakneſs, which the ſiege or the invaſion of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> hath brought upon them; or more generally, The inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (and under this type all the members of Gods Church are intended) ſhall through Gods favour, live in a proſperous and comfortable condition, free from all things hurtful to them. Yet I know many underſtand it, as ſpoken with reſpect to that which was ſaid in the foregoing verſe, That the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould run out with all alacrity to ſeize upon the prey in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp; no man ſhould withdraw himſelf from going forth under a pretence of being ſick or weak: <hi>the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity;</hi> and ſo God being reconciled to them, all ſhall be well with them; God will proceed no more in a way of wrath and vengeance againſt them.</p>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For it is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the year of recompence for the controverſie of Zion.]</hi> That is, It is the ſet time which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for taking vengeance on thoſe his enemies, and for recompencing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly into their boſoms, all the wrongs they had done to his people. For by <hi>the controverſie of Zion</hi> here, is meant, the controverſie which the <hi>Jews</hi> had with the <hi>Edomites</hi> for the miſchief they had often done them; or the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie which God would have with them on his peoples behalf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the ſtreams thereof ſhall be turned into pitch, and the duſt thereof into brimſtone, and the land thereof ſhall become burning pitch.]</hi> That is, the ſtreams, or the land of <hi>Bozrah</hi> or <hi>Idumea.</hi> In this Rhetorical deſcription of the devaſtation of this Country, there is certainly an alluſion, as often elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.19. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.23. And the meaning ſeems to be, either 1. that their Cities being ſet on fire, ſhould burn like pitch and brimſtone: Or 2. that the land ſhould be left deſolate, the inhabitants, and all therein, being as it were burnt up; that is, utterly conſumed and deſtroyed: ſee <hi>Obad.</hi> 1.8. Or 3. that their whole Country, even the moſt fruitful and beſt watered places thereof, ſhould be dry and parched, as if it were all pitch and brimſtone, or burnt up with ſhowers of fire and brimſtone, as <hi>Sodom and Gomorrha</hi> were: ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 18.15, 16.</p>

The meaning is, either 1 that God would order it ſo, that it ſhould never be built again: they that ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, ſhould find the iſſue of their labour to be nothing but confuſion and emptineſs, according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereas Edom ſaith, We are impoveriſhed; but we will return and build the deſolate places: thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, They ſhall build, but I will throw down.</hi> Or 2. that God would lay their whole land utterly waſte and deſolate. The expreſſion here uſed, of doing this by line and level, is taken from workmen, either that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pull down ſome part of a building, are wont by line and level to mark out how far it muſt be pulled down; or elſe, that having quite pulled down a building, do uſe thoſe inſtruments to ſee the ground be layed level.

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THe wilderneſs and the ſolitary place ſhall be glad for them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, For the deſtruction of the enemies of Gods people, related in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and conſeqently for the deliverance of his people thereby. And the ſame is intended in the following clauſe; <hi>and the deſart ſhall rejoyce and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as the roſe.</hi> But now whereas ſome would have the meaning to be, that the very deſarts in <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould rejoyce at this ſo great a mercy; as if the Prophet had ſaid, that the very ſenſleſs Creatures ſhould triumph; for this ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.12. I rather think, that by <hi>the wilderneſs, the ſolitary place and the deſart,</hi> is meant, the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> which was by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> laid waſte like a deſart (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.9.) and much more afterwards, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried captive into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the promiſe here made, that this wilderneſs and deſart ſhould be glad and rejoyce, muſt be underſtood of the flouriſhing and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42788:182"/>
condition whereinto this land ſhould be brought, when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> firſt, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> afterward ſhould be deſtroyed. Only we muſt know, that under this type a greater mercy is promiſed, to wit, That the Church both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> under Chriſt, that were in their natural eſtate, as a dry and barren Wilderneſs, void of all goodneſs and grace, ſhould be brought into a bleſſed, flouriſhing and joyful Condition ſpiritually and initially in this life, but perfectly hereafter in Heaven; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.15, 16. And thus even the <hi>Edomites,</hi> that were threatned in the foregoing Chapter, to be turned into a wilderneſs, are a part of that deſert that ſhould thus triumph in Chriſts van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of their ſpiritual Enemies. To be ſure many Expoſitors hold, That in this myſtical ſenſe, the Gentiles are principally, if not ſolely intended. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ever even in this promiſe may be included alſo, That when Chriſt ſhall deſtroy the enemies of his Church, ſhe that was under thoſe perſecutions laid waſte as a deſert, ſhall then be brought into a flouriſhing and triumphant Condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>It ſhall bloſſom abundantly, and rejoyce even with joy and ſinging,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Wilderneſs before mentioned: See the foregoing Note: <hi>the glory of Lebanon ſhall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon.</hi> They that underſtand this of the very deſerts of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſay, that hereby is ſhown how they ſhould rejoyce and ſing, to wit, by becoming as gloriouſly fruitful, as the moſt fruitful places of the Land, which then muſt needs be taken hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, But now underſtanding it of the Church under Chriſt, this Expreſſion might be intended to ſet forth both her exceeding great Glory in general, and more particularly that all the Glory and glorious priviledges which the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly enjoyed, ſhould be transferred upon her; as namely thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God,</hi> that is, The Wilderneſs and Deſert before mentioned, or the faithful people of God, that were before as a Deſert and Wilderneſs. Some underſtand this alſo, as that before, as ſpoken in a hyperbolical way of the Deſerts themſelves. But it is rather meant of Gods people, to wit, that in Gods deſtroying their enemies, and delivering them, when they were in ſuch a forlon Condition, they ſhould through faith experimentally ſee and own the glorious power and other excellencies of God as clearly diſcovered to them; See the foregoing Note. And obſervable it is, with what joy the Prophet expreſſeth this, as with reſpect to their peculiar intereſt in God; <hi>and the excellency of our God.</hi> But now, if we underſtand this of the Church under Chriſt, then by theſe words, <hi>they ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. may be meant, That they, even the blind Gentiles alſo, with the reſt, ſhould ſee and acknowledg both the Glory of Chriſts perſon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>And we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father</hi>) and likewiſe of that great work of Redemption, which he came to perform.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.]</hi> See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 4.3. Having told them how God would deſtroy his peoples enemies and deliver them; this is added to encourage them hereupon againſt all baſe incredulous fears. And it may be taken, as ſpoken either to the Prophets in thoſe times, that they ſhould chear up the people, whoſe hearts were ready to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42788:183"/>
ſink for fear of their enemies, and to the Teachers in the Church in Goſpel-times, that they ſhould comfort afflicted, trembling Conſciences; or elſe to the faithful people themſelves, that they ſhould hearten one another, or chear up their own fearful hearts. And indeed in this laſt ſenſe the Apoſtle ſeems to apply theſe words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be ye ſtrong, fear not,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as ſome would have it, Say ſo to your own fainting hearts. But for this, ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>Behold, your God will come with vengeance,</hi> as if he had ſaid, However your enemies deride you for your confidence in your God, yet <hi>your God</hi> will ſurely come to take vengeance on your enemies, to wit, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or <hi>Babylonians; even God with a recompence,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.8. <hi>he will come and ſave you,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, He will not ſave you from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> by the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> as you expect, but by his own immediate hand from Heaven. But now referring this to the days of the Goſpel, there is more implied in theſe words: for, <hi>behold your God will come with vengeance,</hi> &amp;c. may be underſtood not only of Chriſts taking vengeance on thoſe that perſecute and oppreſs his Church and people, but alſo of his firſt coming into the World for the Redemption of his people, that he might vanquiſh, and be avenged on their ſpiritual enemies, Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, that ſo his people being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of the hands of theſe their enemies, might ſerve him without fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. See the Note, <hi>Chap</hi> 9.4. and ſee alſo 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. And as this hath reſpect to the Gentiles, there is a ſpecial <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Behold your God will come with vengeance,</hi> as if he had ſaid, He that will be now <hi>your God</hi> as well as ours, <hi>he will come and ſave you,</hi> that is, Even he himſelf in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped.]</hi> How this is to be underſtood of the holy change that ſhould be wrought in the <hi>Jews,</hi> after the vengeance executed upon the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and the deliverances of Gods people that followed thereupon; See the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.18. and 32.3. But queſtionleſs under this type, there is a Prophecy couched of the miraculous cures that Chriſt ſhould work (and therefore we find, that the accompliſhment of this is alledged by our Saviour, as a clear proof that he was the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Matth. 11.4, 5. <hi>Go and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee. The blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk,</hi> &amp;c. And likewiſe of that greater wonder he ſhould work in curing thoſe that were ſpiritually blind and deaf, by the preaching of the Goſpel. And indeed Chriſts miraculous Cures upon the bodies of men, were but pledges of the ſpiritual Cures which Chriſt was come to work upon the ſouls of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, for Joy. This may be underſtood as hyperbolically ſpoken of the joy that would be amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon the ſlaughter made in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, or upon their return out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But withal under this type is foretold the miraculous Cures of Chriſt, the punctual accompliſhment whereof we find in the Cripple's leaping, when he was cured of his lameneſs,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42788:183"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 3.8. and with all the ſpiritual Cures that ſhould be wrought upon men by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; to wit, That they that were before cripled and lame for doing any thing that was truly good, ſhould with all chearfulneſs run in the ways of Gods Commandments; and that thoſe that were before dumb for ſpeaking of ſpiritual and heavenly things, ſhould diſcourſe freely of ſuch things, and gladly ſing forth the praiſes of God: <hi>for</hi> (this is added to ſhew the reaſon of ſuch exceeding great joy) <hi>in the wilderneſs ſhall water break out, and ſtreams in the deſert;</hi> that is, <hi>Judea</hi> that was as a wilderneſs, ſhall become as a fruitful and well watered land; and that which is implied is, that there ſhall be a bleſſed and joyful change in their ſtate, and no want of any thing they could deſire. And then alſo under this type is ſignified how exceeding fruitful and happy the ſtate of the Church ſhould be at the coming of Chriſt, and that by the abundant pouring forth of the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit upon them, which we find often compared to ſtreams of water in the Scripture; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. &amp;c. and 7.38. and may be here compared to waters breaking forth in a wilderneſs, as in alluſion to the waters that guſhed out of the Rock, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtruck in the wilderneſs. But for this, ſee the Notes, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the parched ground ſhall become a pool, and the thirſty land ſprings of water,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note; <hi>in the habitation of Dragons,</hi> who delight in deſert and dry places where ſuch lay, <hi>ſhall be graſs with Reeds and Ruſhes,</hi> which always grow in moiſt and watery places, <hi>Job</hi> 8.11. So that the meaning is, That the moſt deſolate and waſte places ſhould flouriſh again. But now if we take this as a prediction of the bleſſed change that ſhould be wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men in the days of the Goſpel; the meaning ſeems to be, that the moſt ſavage and brutiſh people, men given up to all kind of vices, no better indeed than dens of Devils, ſhould be made Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, richly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Graces of Gods Spirit, and abundant in good works.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And a high-way ſhall be there, and a way,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, In this land, of a wilderneſs become a fruitful well watered land, there ſhall be <hi>a high-way,</hi> that is, a fair common-road-way for thoſe that travel with beaſts and carriages; <hi>and a way,</hi> that is, a ſmaller path-way for foot-Paſſengers; Or, <hi>a high-way,</hi> that is, a Cawſey or Caſtway (as there uſeth to be in watery Countrys, ſuch as he had ſpoken of in the foregoing verſe) <hi>and a way,</hi> that is, another ordinary way. But that which the Prophet intended hereby, is either that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have a free and ſafe paſſage without encumbrance or moleſtation in their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or elſe rather, That their Country that had lain waſte and deſolate like a wilderneſs, ſhould then be quietly and peaceably inhabited again. Whereas in Wilderneſſes and Deſerts, there is uſually no path to be ſeen, it ſhall not be ſo with the people of God, when God ſhall have wrought this happy change for them, their ways ſhall be kept fair and fit for all ſorts of Travellers, and ſhall not lye deſolate, as before (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.8.) but be continually frequented with multitudes that paſs up and down in them: they ſhall freely travel from all parts of the land to the Temple and back again, and ſo likewiſe to other places; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33 17. <hi>and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs,</hi> to wit, becauſe the people that went
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42788:184"/>
up and down in it ſhould be a holy people, a people that ſhould be much in frequenting the Temple, Gods holy place, and ſuch as ſhould live as becomes thoſe that are a holy people to the Lord (all which may be ſaid too, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the way of the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſhall not paſs over it,</hi> that is, The land ſhall not be in the poſſeſſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Infidels of foreign Nations, as formerly; nor ſhall the people of God that are there, be a ſinful, wicked people, as formerly they have been (he alludes in this Expreſſion to that law that forbad the coming of any perſons that were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally unclean, into the Temple) <hi>but it ſhall be for thoſe,</hi> thoſe holy ones, with reſpect to whom it was before called <hi>the way of holineſs;</hi> thoſe regenerate ones upon whom thoſe ſpiritual Cures ſhould be wrought, mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. I know theſe laſt words may be read as in the margin, <hi>for he ſhall be with them;</hi> and then the meaning is clear, to wit, That God would be with them, as once he went along with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their travelling through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Canaan,</hi> Exod. 13.21. to protect, conduct and proſper them, by which means they ſhould be preſerved in purity and holineſs. And thereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>the wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein;</hi> that is, it ſhall be ſo plain, ſo direct and eaſie a way, that the ſimpleſt that are (ſuch as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>that know not how to go to the City,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.15. See the Note there) ſhall not miſs of it. But now if we underſtand all this of the days of the Goſpel, whereof the other was a type, then the way here promiſed is Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. Or, the way preſcribed in the Goſpel for poor ſinners to attain that life and ſalvation which is tendered in Chriſt, the way of faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; of which therefore it is ſaid, That <hi>it ſhall be called the way of holineſs,</hi> becauſe it is the way that leads to the Holy of Holies in Heaven; and becauſe none go in that way, but thoſe that are <hi>ſanctified and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. This way to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal is <hi>for thoſe</hi> and no other; for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. And then of this way it is ſaid alſo, That <hi>the wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein,</hi> becauſe it is ſo clearly diſcovered in the Goſpel, that the ſimpleſt that are, need not miſs the way, unleſs they will wilfully do it; and becauſe men are naturally very fools before by the Goſpel they are brought in to Chriſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. But when they are once brought to believe in Chriſt, they are ſure by the guidance of his Spirit, not ſo to err in their way, though they be never ſo ſimple, as to miſs of life eternal.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>No Lyon ſhall be there, nor any ravenous beaſt ſhall go up thereon: it ſhall not be found there,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning is, That in their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in their paſſing up and down in their own land, they ſhould not be annoyed with any ravenous wild Beaſts, to wit, ſuch as he had threatned ſhould poſſeſs their land, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.13, 14. when it lay waſte as a Deſert. But here again under this type is meant, That Chriſt would ſecure and protect his in their way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; neither Satan, nor any other of their ſpiritual enemies ſhould make a prey of their ſouls; neither ſhould their wicked enemies, the Inſtruments of Satan, be able to hurt them; he would carry them on ſafely in their way, till he had lodged them in Heaven; <hi>but the Redeemed ſhall walk there,</hi> to wit, the faithful <hi>Jews,</hi> whom God ſhall deliver out of the hands of their enemies; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42788:184"/>
thoſe whom Chriſt ſhall redeem from the Eſtate of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And the ranſomed of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, His redeemed ones; See the foregoing Note, <hi>ſhall return and come to Zion,</hi> that is, from thoſe places whither they had fled to hide and ſhelter themſelves, either within the Land, or in foreign parts; when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> firſt invaded the land, hearing of the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, they ſhall come back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the Temple in <hi>Zion,</hi> there to praiſe God for their deliverance (or it may be meant as well of their return from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity; and ſo the main intent of the words might be to ſignifie, that God having brought them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> would not leave them, till he had brought them ſafe to <hi>Jeruſalem) with Songs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads,</hi> that is, Joy of long continuance, ſuch as haply was a refreſhing to thoſe that were joyed with it ſo long as they lived; or joy that ſhould be for ever remembred in their anniverſary Feſtivals. But withal, obſervable is this expreſſion, <hi>and everlaſting joy upon their heads;</hi> for though by <hi>their heads</hi> may be meant only the ſeveral perſons of Gods redeemed ones (as uſually elſewhere, ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 29.3. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.22) yet I rather think, that here this Expreſſion is uſed to imply, that their joy ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the chearfulneſs of their countenances, their going up and down with their heads lifted up, and perhaps with Crowns and Garlands ever green upon their heads; <hi>they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away;</hi> that is, Their former grief and mourning ſhall vaniſh quite away, as if they had never been. But now moſt fitly may all this be applyed to that great work of our Redemption by Chriſt, whereof thoſe deliverances of the <hi>Jews</hi> were types and ſhadows; as namely, That all Chriſts redeemed ones, turning from their ſins, ſhall firſt come in and joyn themſelves to his Church with exceeding great joy, yea, with everlaſting joy, joy that ſhall overcome and ſwallow up all their ſorrows, and which no man ſhall ever be able to take from them; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22. And then again, that Chriſt having thus called them to himſelf, would never leave them, till he had lodged them in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where indeed their joy ſhall be everlaſting, and without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſorrow, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>NOw it came to paſs,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet inſerts an Hiſtorical relation of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> invading the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the wonderful delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by Gods miraculous deſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrian Army;</hi> and that purpoſely to ſhew how exactly all came to paſs herein, according to what he had long before foretold concerning theſe things as they are ſet down in the foregoing Chapters of this his Prophecy; that ſo this might be a ſeal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Prophetical Office to the people, and might let them ſee with what
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42788:185"/>
aſſurance they might expect that all other things which he had foretold, or ſhall foretel hereafter, even thoſe things which concern Chriſt, and the days of the Goſpel, ſhould certainly alſo be accompliſhed in their ſeaſon. We have the very ſame relation, almoſt word for word, in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.13. &amp;c. (which makes it very probable, that this part of that Hiſtory was compoſed by <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) and the chief thing requiſite to be known, for the underſtanding thereof, may be found in the Notes there; or in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.1, &amp;c. Only in that which is ſaid here concerning the time of <hi>Sennacherebs</hi> invading <hi>Judea,</hi> that it was <hi>in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah;</hi> this is further obſervable, that it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore within a while after this good King had made ſuch a Reformation in the Land, as never any King before him had made, that this grievous ſtorm fell upon him and his Kingdom, which muſt needs be both a great tryal, and a great ſtumbling-block to many. But ſee, I ſay, the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the King of Aſſyria ſent Rabſhakeh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſtood by the Conduit of the upper pool, in the high way of the Fullers field.]</hi> For this place ſee the Note before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiahs ſon, which was over the houſe; and Shebna, the ſcribe,</hi> &amp;c.] What is noted before concerning theſe two, <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi> and <hi>Shebna,</hi> we may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.15. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.18. Queſtionleſs this <hi>Eliakim</hi> was the ſame of whom the Prophet had before prophecied, that he ſhould be ſurely ſetled in that place of high preferment in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Court, which now it ſeems he was in, <hi>Shebna</hi> that was formerly in it being removed, See <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.20, 21. &amp;c. And we may well think what a ſhaking it was to the faith of this good man concerning this promiſe, when he was now to go out to beg terms of peace of the proud Tyrant <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> ready in a manner to yield to any Conditions almoſt, which he would be pleaſed to put upon them. As for <hi>Shebna</hi> here mentioned, I conceive as before, that it was not <hi>Shebna,</hi> into whoſe place <hi>Eliakim</hi> was put, becauſe it ſeems not very probable, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> would imploy ſuch a wicked wretch, ſo likely to be diſcontented, and ſo juſtly therefore to be ſuſpected, in ſuch a weighty ſervice as this was.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And Rabſhakeh ſaid unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus ſaith the great King, the King of Aſſyria, What confidence is this wherein thou truſteſt?]</hi> That is, What confidence is it that hath emboldned thee, firſt to rebel againſt me, and now to ſtand out againſt me when I am come with ſuch a mighty Army to reduce thee under my power?</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>I ſay (ſayeſt thou) (but they are but vain words) I have counſel and ſtrength for war.]</hi> In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.20. this paſſage is expreſſed thus, <hi>Thou ſayeſt (but they are but vain words) I have counſel and ſtrength for the war;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there it is clear, that <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> chargeth <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with boaſting to the people, that they ſhould be well enough able to defend the City againſt <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheribs</hi> forces, as being ſufficiently furniſhed both with <hi>Counſel and Strength for War;</hi> and withal tells him, that theſe were but <hi>vain words;</hi> that is, ſuch as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> himſelf knew were but meer boaſting words, that had no ground of truth in them, and therefore would be of no avail for the ſaving of the City. And ſo likewiſe if we read that paſſage in the Hiſtory of the Kings, as it is
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42788:185"/>
there rendred in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>Thou talkeſt (but they are vain words) counſel and ſtrength are for the War;</hi> according to that Tranſlation of the words it is alſo clear, that <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> told <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he talked at a high rate, and uttered many big words, thereby to hearten and encourage the people, as namely, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would come in to their help; or that however the Lord Jehovah would ſurely deliver them, if the people would earneſtly call upon him for help; and that withal he added, That all this was to no purpoſe, ſuch <hi>vain words</hi> would not defend the City, there was more requiſite for the guarding of the City than ſo; <hi>counſel and ſtrength are for the war.</hi> Well, but why is this paſſage rendred here, not as there, <hi>Thou ſayeſt,</hi> but <hi>I ſay,</hi> &amp;c? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That though it be <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> that ſaith here, <hi>I ſay,</hi> yet he ſpeaks this in the perſon of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I know well enough what thou talkeſt and prateſt; to wit, <hi>I ſay, I have counſel and ſtrength for war;</hi> but theſe are but <hi>vain words.</hi> And therefore indeed thoſe words <hi>(ſayeſt thou)</hi> are for the clearing of this, well inſerted by our Tranſlators, <hi>I ſay, ſayeſt thou,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>now on whom doſt thou truſt, that thou rebelleſt againſt me?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, If it be not a vain confidence of thine own ſufficient ſtrength whereon thou relieſt, on whoſe help is it then that thou truſteſt, in the hope whereof thou haſt emboldned thy ſelf to rebel againſt me?</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Lo, thou truſteſt in the ſtaff of this broken reed, on Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] He terms <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the King of <hi>Egypt a ſtaff of reed,</hi> by way of alluſion to thoſe Reeds, and Canes of Reeds, which grew abundantly on the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and were famouſly known in foreign Countrys whither they were carried. But withal obſervable it is, That the people that would not mind Gods Prophet, when he from God did ſo often threaten them for their confidence in <hi>Egypt</hi> (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.2. and 31.1.) are now to their greater vexation, brought to hear themſelves upbraided with this by an inſulting Adverſary.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>But if thou ſay to me, We truſt in the Lord our God: is it not he whoſe high places, and whoſe altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and ſaid to Judah and to Jeruſalem, Ye ſhall worſhip before this altar?]</hi> Though it was in obedience to Gods Command, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had pulled down theſe high places and altars, yet there was much cunning couched in this objection of <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi>'s; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of the people, whoſe hearts were not yet wholly taken off from their former Idolatry, would be ready to cloſe with this, and to conclude, That God in his wrath againſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for this, had brought theſe enemies upon their Land; as alſo becauſe there was ſome colourable pretence of reaſon in this, which carnal men might ſoon approve, that it was a wrong and diſhonour to God thus to limit his worſhip to one place; and that it was ſome vain glorious or covetous deſign in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to order it ſo, that all the Sacrifices which the people would offer to their God, ſhould be offered where he kept his Court, and had his conſtant reſidence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my maſter the King of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, That thou wilt perform the Conditions I ſhall propound to him; namely, That if he gave him, as in the next words he promiſeth, <hi>two thouſand horſes,</hi> he would then come out to fight with him; (he gives him to underſtand, that he ſhould not need to ſend to <hi>Egypt</hi> for Horſes, he ſhould have
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42788:186"/>
them of him) or elſe rather, that if he were not able to find men fit to ride and manage them, that then he ſhould reſtore the Horſes again; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that they ſhould ſubmit to his Maſter upon ſuch Conditions as he ſhould be pleaſed to impoſe upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one Captain of the leaſt of my Maſters ſervants?</hi> &amp;c.] And thus he hints to them, that there was no reaſon why they ſhould ſtand out, becauſe <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was not yet come thither with his whole army; he alone, though the leaſt of his Maſters Servants, being able enough to ſubdue them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>But Rabſhakeh ſaid, Hath my Maſter ſent me to thy Maſter and to thee to ſpeak theſe words? Hath he not ſent me to the men that ſit upon the wall?</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, The people that in their turns are appointed to be on the walls for the guarding of them, and for the defence of the City, <hi>that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piſs with you;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, And who indeed are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be there, that the City by a long ſiege might be brought to ſuch ſtreights, that through famine both they and the people might be brought to <hi>eat their own dung, and drink their own piſs.</hi> And thus he would make a ſhew of pitying the people; and withal ſeeks to ſtir them to diſcontent againſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> and his Princes, that cared not to what they expoſed the poor people, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uphold themſelves in their greatneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Then Rabſhakeh ſtood and cried with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He lifted up himſelf as high as he could (for he ſtood before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) and that perhaps in ſome more eminent place, which he had choſen for that purpoſe; and then lifting up his voice together therewith, he ſpake aloud, that the people on the wall might the better hear him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Thus ſaith the King, Let not Hezekiah deceive you,</hi> &amp;c.] He ſaith not, Let not your King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deceive you, as not being willing to put them in mind of that Allegiance which, as Subjects, they did owe to their King.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own,</hi> &amp;c.] Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable it is, how cunningly here <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> avoids that harſher expreſſion of carrying them away Captives, and ſpeaks only of it, as if they were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be tranſplanted from one Country to another; and that (to imply his reſpect to their good) though he durſt not call the land whither they were to go, a better land than that of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet he tells them, that it was a land like to their own, <hi>a land of Corn and Wine, a land of Bread and Vineyards;</hi> and, which is added 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.32. <hi>a land of oyle-Olive and of honey.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſiderable it is alſo, how little this was like to move thoſe that did not ſo much prize the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the outward plenty and fruitfulneſs of it, as for the ſpiritual priviledges that appertained thereto, as it was the inheritance of Gods peculiar people, the Temple and the Communion which they then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God in his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Where are the Gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the Gods of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharvaim,</hi> &amp;c?] As if he ſhould have ſaid, ſay ſome, Where were they when they ſhould have ſaved thoſe that worſhipped them, and the Cities they dwelt in? But rather he ſpeaks of their gods, as deſtroyed together with the Nations
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42788:186"/>
that ſerved them; See the Note before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.9. <hi>and have they delivered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria out of my hands?</hi> that is, The gods of <hi>Samaria;</hi> for that muſt neceſſarily be underſtood from the foregoing words. It was indeed his Father <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> that took <hi>Samaria,</hi> but he might be preſent with his Father in that Expedition. However it is no whit ſtrange, that ſpeaking of the Conqueſts atchieved by the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he ſhould aſcribe to himſelf that which his Father had done before him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Who are they amongſt all the gods of theſe lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the Lord ſhould deliver Jeruſalem out of my hand?]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, If the gods of other Nations were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, their Countries and Cities out of my hands, why ſhould you think the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> your God, able to deliver <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of my hand? And ſo this paſſage is expreſſed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>But they held their peace,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, The men that were ſent forth to treat with <hi>Rabſhakeh.</hi> But I rather think it is meant of the people on the wall, to whom at laſt he addreſſed his ſpeech. And ſo it is expreſly ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.36. <hi>But the people held their peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Then came Eliakim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with their clothes rent,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.29. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.37.</p>

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And he ſent Eliakim,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe they had been ear-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Blaſphemies of <hi>Rabſhakeh, and the Elders of the Prieſts, covered with ſackcloth,</hi> who were joyned with the other, the better to repreſent the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the buſineſs they were come about, and the ſad condition of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God that were in the City; <hi>unto Iſaiah the Prophet the Son of Amos,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. namely, both to engage him to joyn with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the people in praying to God for help; and likewiſe that he might from him be informed of what God would be pleaſed to reveal to them concerning the great ſtreights they were in; and therefore there is expreſs mention made
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42788:187"/>
here of his prophetical Office, <hi>he ſent unto Iſaiah the Prophet;</hi> for though this Prophet had formerly given them ſeveral promiſes from God, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be delivered (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.17.) yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being conſcious to himſelf of the weakneſs of his faith, and the overbearing power of his fears, was deſirous further to be confirmed herein.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And they ſaid unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, delivering the meſſage which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had given them in charge; <hi>Thus ſaith Hezekiah</hi> (where ſome obſerve that they do not ſay, Thus ſaith King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as being deſirous, without minding any thing of State, to expreſs themſelves in the humbleſt manner, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſad condition whereinto they were fallen) <hi>This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blaſphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth:</hi> that is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, into ſo ſad a plight the whole land is, that Women with child fall into travel for fear before their time and dye; becauſe when the child comes to the birth, they have not ſtrength to bring forth.

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabſhakeh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard,</hi> &amp;c.] Thoſe words, <hi>the Lord thy God,</hi> which are twice here repeated, were doubtleſs uſed, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that ſpecial intereſt which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had in God, as he was a Prophet, and that ſpecial reſpect which upon that account the Lord had to him, and to his prayers; <hi>wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left:</hi> that is, Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud unto God for them; whereto agrees that which is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.20. <hi>for this cauſe Hezekiah the King, and the Prophet Iſaiah the Son of Amos, prayed and cried to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>So the Servants of King Hezekiah came to Iſaiah.]</hi> That is, Thus, as is before related, they went and delivered their meſſage to <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> And this is again here inſerted to make way to the following anſwer which the Prophet returned to their Meſſage.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And Iſaiah ſaid unto them, Thus ſhall you ſay unto your Maſter,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, Thus ſhall you ſay to our King, who ſent you his ſervants with this meſſage to me, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou haſt heard, wherewith the ſervants of the King of Aſſyria have blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Alas! they are but words: he ſhall not be able to do what he threatens to do.

               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Behold, I will ſend a blaſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He ſhall be ſtruck with a pannick fear; yet I ſee not why it might not be meant of the terrible tempeſt which ſome think God brought upon the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army when it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.30.

Or if it lay nearer to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> than <hi>Lachiſh,</hi> it is then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that his deſign was only to draw up the reſidue of his Army ſtill nearer to <hi>Jeruſalem; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachiſh,</hi> from whence <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> was at firſt ſent againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And he heard ſay concerning Tirhakah King of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee: and when he heard it, he ſent meſſengers to Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.9. It is not expreſſed whether this was a true or a falſe report; yet it is moſt probable that it was ſo, becauſe we find that God foretold by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhould vanquiſh the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi> with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſo deprive the <hi>Jews</hi> of that aid which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them: See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.1, 3, 4.5. And this in likelihood he did not long after he had again ſent Meſſengers with a ſecond ſummons for the delivering up of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And Hezekiah received the Letter from the hand of the meſſengers, and read it,</hi> &amp;c.] For though God had promiſed to deſtroy <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would not therefore carry himſelf the more inſolently, nor neglect to accept of any fair treaty with his enemy; <hi>and Hezekiah went up into the houſe of the Lord, and ſpread it before the Lord;</hi> that is, In the Temple. But ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord.]</hi> Here again obſervable it is, that though God had already aſſured him, that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> delivered, yet he would not give over uſing the means of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for mercy, and that eſpecially that he might withal ſhew himſelf ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the horrible reproaches which the proud enemy had caſt upon his great name.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. <hi>God of Iſrael, that dwelleſt between the Cherubims;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Manifeſt, O Lord, that thou art preſent amongſt us as thine own peculiar people, ready to help us, and to hear our Prayers, of which thine Ark covered with Cherubims is a viſible ſign to us, by delivering us out of the hands of this blaſpheming Tyrant; and let him ſee what a bold attempt it is in him, to endeavour to diſpoſſeſs thee of thy dwelling place.</p>

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42788:188"/>
the Nations inhabiting thoſe lands, as we find it explained 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.13, 17.</p>

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>This is the word which the Lord hath ſpoken concerning him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, concerning <hi>Sennacherib, The Virgin, the Daughter of Zion hath deſpiſed thee, and laughed thee to ſcorn;</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.8. and 23.12. but eſpecially 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.21. <hi>the Daughter of Jeruſalem hath ſhaken her head at thee,</hi> See the Notes <hi>Job</hi> 16.4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7. as he had before ſhaken his hand at her, See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.32.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Whom haſt thou reproached and blaſphemed? and againſt whom haſt thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as every way diſcovering his pride and inſolence; See the Note, Chap. 10.12. It is all one in effect as if he had ſaid, Little doſt thou think or conſider againſt whom it is that thou haſt thus arrogantly advanced thy ſelf; <hi>even againſt the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> that is, The holy God of Heaven and Earth, that hath choſen <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be a holy people to himſelf; See the Note, Chap. 1.4. It is he whom thou haſt blaſphemed, yea, in the reproaches thou haſt caſt upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his anointed, and upon his people, thou haſt indeed reproached the Lord their God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>By thy Servants haſt thou reproached the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.23. it is, <hi>By thy meſſengers;</hi> and then it follows, <hi>and haſt ſaid, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the Mountains, to the ſides of Lebanon:</hi> that is, I have got over all the hills and mountains that lay in my way, even the loftieſt of them, ſuch as Mount <hi>Lebanon</hi> was, and that not with my foot-forces only, but alſo with my Chariots, which muſt needs be a work of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and only to be maſtered by a mighty Army; as namely, by cutting out and levelling their way where the ground was ſteep and rocky, and full of trees, that obſtructed their paſſage. And this may be meant both of the hills and mountains they climbed, that they might take the Towns and Forts that ſtood thereon, and of thoſe alſo which they were neceſſarily to paſs over, that they might get into the Countrys that lay beyond them. And it might be that he might herein have ſpecial reſpect alſo to thoſe Mountains that were about <hi>Jeruſalem, Pſal.</hi> 125.2. <hi>and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof;</hi> that is, Having thus far ſubdued the land before me, I ſhall eaſily do ſo ſtill; their Cedars and Fir-trees he would cut down at his pleaſure, either to clear his way for his Army to paſs, or for other uſes; See the Note, Chap. 14.8. That which he intends is this, That nothing ſhould hinder him in his approaches to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But withal obſervable it is, that whilſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi> here threatens to hew down the lofty trees of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> God had before threatned and foretold, that his <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that is, his mighty Army ſhould be hewn down; See the Notes, Chap. 10.33, 34. <hi>and I will enter into the height of his border</hi> (in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.23. it is, <hi>into the lodgings of his borders) and the foreſt of his Carmel,</hi> or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and his fruitful field.</hi> Now by <hi>the height of his border,</hi> or <hi>the lodgings of his borders,</hi> ſome underſtand <hi>the tower of Lebanon,</hi> Cant. 7.4. which according to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42788:188"/>
our Tranſlation, <hi>I will enter into the height of his border,</hi> ſeems not ſo probable, becauſe it is before ſaid, That the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had already marched over that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And others again underſtand thereby <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Metropolis and chief place of the Kingdom, which being taken, there would nothing elſe in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be done; and by <hi>the foreſt of his Carmel,</hi> they underſtand the Country thereabout, becauſe for the pleaſantneſs and fruitfulneſs of it, it was like another <hi>Carmel,</hi> and with the abundance of Fruit-trees and Vines growing therein, it ſhewed like a foreſt. Indeed, having compared this place with that in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.23. this ſeems to be the moſt probable Expoſition, that by <hi>the height of his border,</hi> is meant the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> together with the forts and holds on the frontiers thereabouts; and by <hi>the foreſt of his Carmel,</hi> the goodly and pleaſant Country in that part of <hi>Judea.</hi> But ſee the Notes in that, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>I have digged and drunk water,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.24. it is, <hi>I have digged and drunk ſtrange waters;</hi> and it follows as here, <hi>and with the ſole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the beſieged places;</hi> for which ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.24. The Expreſſion here uſed of drying up great Rivers with the ſole of his feet, is doubtleſs an hyperbolical vaunt; as if he ſhould have ſaid, That his Army was ſo numerous, that with their feet alone they were able to dry up all the waters where they came; or rather, That though the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were never ſo great, his ſouldiers and their beaſts were able to drink them all dry. However, that which is intended hereby, was, That the waters could no where keep him off from any place which he meant to aſſault; either by diverting their waters ſome other way, or by ſome ſuch like policy, he could take a courſe that their waters ſhould be no hinderance to him. Now thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the words, there may be therein a threatning covertly couched, to wit, that he could ſoon deprive <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of her waters, which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had been ſo careful to ſecure for them, whereby they muſt needs be forced to yield, or elſe muſt periſh with thirſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Hast thou not heard,</hi> &amp;c?] <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Behold, thou hast heard what the Kings of Aſſyria have done to all lands by deſtroying them utterly;</hi> and to this now God replys, <hi>Haſt thou not heard long ago, how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it?</hi> that is, That all that thou and thy Anceſtors have done, was indeed done by me, by my decree, and all-ruling providence (which accordingly therefore I did long ago make known by my Prophets, as Chap. 10.5. <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger,</hi> &amp;c.) and that you therefore were but the inſtruments in mine hand to do what I would have done; <hi>and ſhall the ax boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith?</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 10.15. <hi>Now have I brought it to paſs, that thou ſhouldeſt be to lay waſte defenced Cities into ruinous heaps.</hi> But for this whole verſe, ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.25.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Therefore their inhabitants were of ſmall power, they were diſmaied and confounded,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes for this and the following verſe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.26, 27. <hi>they were as the graſs of the field, and as the green herb;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4. <hi>as the graſs on the houſe tops,</hi> which the higher it ſtands, the ſooner it is burnt up and withered; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.6.</p>

                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:42788:189"/>Ver. 29. <hi>Becauſe thy rage againſt me, and thy tumult is come up into mine ears: therefore will I put my hook in thy noſe,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words there ſeems to be an Alluſion either to fiſh-hooks wherewith when they have ſtruck ſome great fiſh through the noſe, they uſe to draw it along this way and that, to the end that having thus wearied it, they may the better take it up (for the proof whereof that paſſage is uſually alledged, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3, 4. <hi>I am againſt thee, Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great Dragon that lieth in the midſt of his rivers—But I will put my hooks in thy chaws;</hi> or elſe to thoſe rings which men are wont to put into the noſes of Bears and Bufales, that they may the better over-maſter them, and carry them up and down which way they liſt. It is all one in effect, as if God had ſaid, Becauſe thou rageſt againſt me like ſome furious wild beaſt, therefore I will uſe thee like a beaſt; <hi>therefore will I put my hook in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way which thou cameſt.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, becauſe men mad with rage, are wont to diſcover their fury by the puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of their noſtrils, and the foming of their mouths, it may well be that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference hereto, the Lord doth the rather uſe this Expreſſion, <hi>therefore will I put my hook in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And this ſhall be a ſign unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, To thee, O <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah: ye ſhall eat this year ſuch as groweth of it ſelf, and the ſecond year that which ſpringeth of the ſame; and in the third year ſow ye and reap,</hi> &amp;c. Now though it cannot well be queſtioned, that this was given as a ſign for the ſtrengthning of his and the peoples faith concerning the foregoing promiſe of the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet withal it is clear, that this tended alſo to the comforting of them both againſt the fear of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again with a freſh Army, becauſe they are hereby aſſured, that after his departure they ſhould live peaceably and quietly in the land; and likewiſe eſpecially againſt that great diſtreſs they muſt needs be in, thinking how they ſhould be provided for food, if they were rid of their enemies, when they had ſo far ſpent their old ſtore, and the enemy had ſpoiled that which was growing in the field, and had, it may be, hindred them that year from ſowing their ſeed, which might have yielded them a Crop at harveſt-time. But for this ſign, and how it muſt be underſtood, ſee in the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.30. and ſee alſo the Note before, Chap. 7.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And the remnant that is eſcaped of the houſe of Judah, ſhall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.]</hi> That is, They ſhall multiply exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and being ſetled in the land, ſhall proſper and flouriſh, both in their outward eſtate, and ſpiritually too, which was indeed accompliſhed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> reign. But ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.30.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>For out of Jeruſalem ſhall go forth a remnant, and they that eſcape out of mount Zion,</hi> &amp;c.] As if it had been ſaid, As for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in particular (of which the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had ſaid, that God himſelf ſhould not defend it) they that were ſhut up in her, ſhall go out freely and fearleſly wherever they pleaſe; they that were fled thither, ſhall return to their own habitations; and the reſt, whitherſoever their occaſions ſhall call them; yet it may alſo have reſpect to their going forth to gather the ſpoils of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> See the Notes, Chap. 33.23, 24. and to thoſe that ſhould be ſent forth from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to repair the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42788:189"/>
great ruines that had been made in many Cities in the land. And how this may be alſo myſtically applied to that ſmall remnant that ſhould go out of <hi>Zion</hi> in the days of the Goſpel, to encreaſe the number of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> amongſt the Gentiles, we may ſee in the Note, Chap. 1.9. <hi>the zeal of the Lord of hoſts ſhall do this;</hi> that is, the zeal of God Almighty, who can do what he pleaſeth, will do this. But ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.31.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord concerning the King of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, becauſe the Lord is thus reſolved to preſerve his people, <hi>He ſhall not come into this City, nor ſhoot an arrow there, nor come before it with ſhields, nor caſt a bank againſt it;</hi> the meaning is, that he ſhould never come to make any aſſault upon it, nor ſo much as to lay ſiege to it. By coming <hi>before it with ſhields,</hi> is meant, drawing up men that were to ſcale the walls, and to enter the City, who uſed to be armed <hi>with ſhields,</hi> therewith to cover and ſhelter themſelves from any thing that might be caſt upon them, or any ſtrokes that might be made at them by thoſe on the wall. And by banks caſt up, may be meant, thoſe banks which the ſouldiers caſt up under the Covert, whereof they were to make their approaches to the City; or Mounts caſt up, out of which they were to ſhoot into the City. But ſee the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.32.</p>

               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>For I will defend this City, to ſave it, for mine own ſake,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, For mine own Glory; becauſe I have taken them of mine own free grace to be mine own Covenant-people, and determined that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be the ſetled place of my Worſhip; and that I may vindicate mine own glory from the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Aſperſions of the <hi>Aſſyrian; and for my Servant Davids ſake;</hi> that is, For the love I bear to his ſeed for his ſake; and that I may make good the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I made to him, and not becauſe the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> have deſerved any ſuch favour at mine hands.

               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. it is, <hi>And it came to paſs that night</hi> (which makes it more than probable, that this was done the very night after the foregoing promiſe made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> concerning the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army, and the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem) that the Angel of the Lord went out,</hi> to wit, from Heaven, or from the Lord (as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.21. That <hi>the Lord ſent an Angel) and ſmote in the camp of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand;</hi> See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. Why this was done in the night, we may eaſily conceive; namely, that this Judgment might come upon them the more ſuddenly, and with greater terror; and ſo likewiſe why it was done by <hi>an Angel,</hi> to wit, that they might clearly ſee, that it was by the immediate Sword of God, for the horrible contempt they had caſt upon him; for which ſee the Note, Chap. 31.8 A more difficult queſtion is, Where <hi>the camp of the Aſſyrians</hi> was, when the Angel made this ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them? Now though concerning this, we may upon clear grounds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42788:190"/>
1. That it was in the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> according to that, Chap. 14.25. <hi>I will break the Aſſyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot;</hi> for which ſee the Note there. And 2ly. That <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for above, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. it is expreſly ſaid, That he ſhould never do that; yet in what particular place he lay encamped with his Army, I find no where expreſſed. Some think it was at <hi>Libnah,</hi> where <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> found him, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. when he went back to him from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And again others hold, that it was at <hi>Nob,</hi> a Town not far from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which I judge the more probable, becauſe Chap. 10.32. where our Prophet ſeems to deſcribe the manner of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi> marching from one place to another, when he went up againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Nob</hi> is mentioned as the laſt place where he pitched his Camp; and from thence it is ſaid, That he ſhaked his hand againſt Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> as by way of threatning, that he would now preſently be with her; See the Note in that place. So that I ſay, it is moſt probable, that whilſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi> made a ſtand there, that he might put all things in a readineſs for the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there it was that his Army was miraculouſly deſtroyed by an Angel. Only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al it is moſt likely too, which others ſay, That this ſlaughter was made, not only in <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Camp wherever it was, but alſo amongſt thoſe forces which <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> had from the firſt left to block up <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And accordingly of both places, that muſt be underſtood which followeth, <hi>and when they aroſe early in the morning,</hi> that is, The Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that looked every moment for the coming of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> or rather thoſe few of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that God would have eſcape the ſword of the Angel; <hi>and behold, they were all,</hi> that is, Their whole Army, in a manner, <hi>dead corpſes;</hi> that is, Not ſick and dying, but ſtark dead. By what manner of death they were deſtroyed, it is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: only ſome places elſewhere in this Prophecy ſeem to import, That a mighty and terrible tempeſt fell upon the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> at that time when this Havock was made amongſt them; for which, ſee the Note, Chap. 30.30.</p>
               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>So Sennacherib King of Aſſyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Niniveh.]</hi> That is, He with thoſe few that were not ſlain by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, fled away home into their own Country. And thus God was pleaſed to order it by his providence, that he ſhould eſcape, and not fall by the Sword of the Angel; 1. That he might to his greater confuſion ſee the dreadful power of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he had deſpiſed and blaſphemed, clearly diſcovered in that ſtrange and horrid Judgment which he found executed upon his Army. 2ly. That he might to his exceeding vexation flee back in ſo diſgraceful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the very way that he came; See the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. And 3ly. that he might be reſerved to a death far ſadder in many reſpects, than that of his being ſlain by the Angel, as is related in the following verſe. As for <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that was at preſent the chief City of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11. that <hi>ſtrong hold,</hi> whereunto the Prophet had before foretold he ſhould flee, See the Notes, Chap. 31.8, 9.</p>

That this was that which by theſe words of his he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beg of God, is evident; becauſe in that promiſe that is afterward made to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of lengthning out his days, God is ſaid to grant him that which he had prayed for: And therefore we may well think that the reaſon why he did not go on and expreſs this in his Prayer, was, becauſe he was not able to ſpeak any longer for weeping, as it is immediately added in the Text, <hi>and Hezekiah wept ſore:</hi> And ſo what he could not, or perhaps was afraid to ask in words, becauſe it was contrary to what God had ſaid ſhould be, his tears ſpake, and God heard them.

                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:42788:191"/>Ver. 5. <hi>Go and ſay to Hezekiah, Thus ſaith the Lord God of David thy Father,</hi> &amp;c.] By theſe words he makes known to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he was mindful of the Covenant he had made with <hi>David,</hi> concerning his continuing of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah</hi> to his Poſterity; <hi>I have heard thy Prayers, I have ſeen thy tears, behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years;</hi> that is, To the days thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lived. In 2 <hi>King.</hi> there is another particular inſerted in the promiſe here made, to wit, That on the third day he ſhould go up to the Houſe of the Lord. But for this and the following verſe, ſee the Notes, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And this ſhall be a ſign unto thee from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.8. It is ſaid, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſired a ſign of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to aſſure him, that this which he had promiſed him ſhould certainly be (which the Prophet hath likewiſe noted in the cloſe of this Chapter) and that hereupon God by the Prophet made him this promiſe of a ſign; for which ſee the Note there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Behold, I will bring again the ſhadow of the Degrees which is gone down in the Sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward,</hi> &amp;c.] In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.9, 10. it is ſaid, that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſired a ſign of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for the ſtrengthning of his faith, the Prophet tendered to him two different ſigns, leaving him to his choice which of them he would take; namely, That the ſhadow on the Sun-dial ſhould either <hi>go forward ten degrees, or go backward ten degrees;</hi> and that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> anſwered, That it was <hi>a light thing for the ſhadow to go down ten degrees;</hi> and deſired rather that the ſhadow might <hi>return backward ten degrees</hi> (for all which ſee the Notes in that place) hereupon this promiſe was made him of bringing back the ſhadow ten degrees; the accompliſhment whereof is related in the next words, <hi>ſo the Sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down,</hi> to wit, after the Prophet had prayed that it might be ſo; for this is expreſly inſerted, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.11. <hi>And Iſaiah the Prophet cried unto the Lord, and he brought the ſhadow ten degrees backward,</hi> &amp;c. for all which ſee the Notes there. Yet withal this alſo is here obſervable, that thoſe words, <hi>ſo the ſame returned ten degrees,</hi> may well induce us to think, that the miracle now wrought, was not, as ſome would have it, in the going back of the ſhadow in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> whilſt the Sun kept on its courſe, but in the retrograde motion of the Sun it ſelf. And indeed how elſe could they in <hi>Babylon</hi> take notice of this Wonder? See the Note 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.12. And beſide, the Analogy between the ſign and the thing ſignified, depends much upon this. Princes are in their Kingdoms as the Sun in the World. The bringing back therefore of the Sun, when it was haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its ſetting, and the lengthning of the day thereby beyond its natural time, was moſt fit to ſignifie, that after the ſame manner, how impoſſible it might ſeem, conſidering the deſperateneſs of his diſeaſe, and the Sentence of Death by God himſelf pronounced againſt him, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould be brought back from the Grave, whither he was poſting, and his life be lengthned out beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>The writing of Hezekiah King of Judah, when he had been ſick, and was recovered of his ſickneſs.]</hi> That is, The Song of Thankſgiving which he compoſed and committed to writing, even as his Father <hi>David</hi> uſed to do, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to leave it to poſterity, as a Monument of his own fainting heart in the time of Gods mercy in recovering him out of his ſickneſs, and his hearty thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:42788:191"/>Ver. 10. <hi>I ſaid in the cutting off of my days,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, When I perceived partly by the violence of my ſickneſs, but eſpecially by the ſentence of death which the Prophet had pronounced againſt me, that God was now hewing me down in great diſpleaſure; I began to think within my ſelf, or I concluded fully within my ſelf as I lay upon my ſick bed, <hi>I ſhall go to the gates of the grave,</hi> that is, I am now a dead man. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I am deprived of the reſidue of my years,</hi> that is, the years I might have lived by the ordinary courſe of nature. Thus in the firſt place he acknowledgeth his own weakneſs, and the terrors wherewith he was ſurprized, when he ſaw himſelf likely to be cut off by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death in the flower of his age (the reaſons whereof ſee before in the Note 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.3.) the more hereby to magnifie the mercy of God to him in his recovery.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>I ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note, <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord,</hi> to wit, in his Temple; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. and 42.2. <hi>even the Lord;</hi> it is twice repeated to ſet forth how vehemently he was afflicted herewith, <hi>in the land of the living;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. And indeed his particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of this, when he deſired a ſign of his recovery, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>What is the ſign that I ſhall go up to the houſe of the Lord?</hi> doth plainly ſhow, that this was one main thing that troubled him, when he lay under the terrors of Death, <hi>I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the World;</hi> that is, I ſhall no longer live amongſt the Children of men here in this World: Or, as I ſhall no more behold God in his Ordinances, ſo I ſhall alſo be cut off from the Communion of the Church of the living; and ſo I ſhall not do that good to the people of God, that were under my charge, that I deſired to do.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Mine age is departed,</hi> &amp;c.] The time of my life and abode here in this World is at an end and gone; <hi>and is removed from me as a Shepherds tent,</hi> who uſe not to ſtay long in a place, but to remove their tents from one place to another; See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 27.18. <hi>I have cut off like a Weaver my life;</hi> that is, I reſolved with my ſelf that my life was cut off; or by my ſins I have provoked the Lord to cut off my life, even as a Weaver cuts off his web from the Loom when he hath finiſhed it, and ſometimes too (which ſome think is here intended) before he hath made an end of it; <hi>he will cut me off with pining ſickneſs;</hi> or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>from the Thrum</hi> (which is the looſe threads of the Woof faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Weavers beam) that is, God will utterly cut me off; <hi>from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me:</hi> that is, All the day long from morning even to night thou wilt be hewing me down, ſo that there is not a moment wherein I am not in fear of death: Or, thou wilt ſpeedily and preſently diſpatch me, this very day before night there will be an end of me; See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 4.20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>I reckoned till morning, that as a lion ſo will he break all my bones,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, All the night long, from evening even to the morning, I lay thinking with my ſelf, and made full account with my ſelf, that partly by the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing pain and ſickneſs I endured in my body, and partly by the inward terrors wherewith my mind was perplexed, God would as a lion tear and devour me both fleſh and bones, and ſo make an end of me. This I conceive is the plain meaning of theſe words; yet ſome, I know, think further, and that not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, that this is ſpoken with relation to what he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42788:192"/>
and ſo that the meaning is, that though he lived out the foregoing day, which he thought he ſhould not have done, yet when the Evening came, all the Night long he was ſo torn and broken with the extremity he was in, that he reckoned for certain that he ſhould dye before morning, or that he could not hold out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. And therefore, ſay they, he repeats here that again, which he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe, <hi>from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me;</hi> and that by reaſon of the extream anguiſh and fear he was in; as if he ſhould have ſaid, I ſhall dye, I ſhall dye, I cannnot long ſubſiſt in this woful plight wherein I now lye.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Like a Crane or a Swallow, ſo did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove,</hi> &amp;c.] Some take the meaning of this to be, that he was ſo weakned and perplexed in mind, that he could hardly ſpeak, and did therefore pour out his complaints and prayers before God with a low, muttering hoarſe and interrupted voice; much to the ſame purpoſe with that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 77.4. <hi>I am ſo troubled, that I cannot ſpeak.</hi> But the meaning rather ſeems to be, that the violence of the pain and ſickneſs he endured in his body, and the terrors he endured in his ſpirit through the fear of preſent death, made him lye groaning, and ſighing, and ſobbing, the confuſed noiſe whereof was much like that of the fowls here mentioned, eſpecially when the young ones do want their meat, or when the Dams have their young ones taken from them: <hi>mine eyes fail with looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to wit, with looking up to God for help; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.82. and <hi>Job</hi> 11.20. <hi>O Lord, I am oppreſſed,</hi> that is, ſo heavily overpreſſed, that I am not able to endure it any longer: <hi>undertake for me,</hi> to wit, as a ſurety; as if he ſhould have ſaid, This ſickneſs hath arreſted me to carry me to deaths Priſon-houſe; reſcue me out of its power, as ſureties do thoſe they engage for; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? he hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it,</hi> &amp;c.] Many learned Expoſitors hold, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> doth ſtill here proceed in bewailing himſelf, and ſetting forth the hopeleſneſs of his Condition; <hi>What ſhall I ſay?</hi> that is, What ſhall I ſay further? What need I ſay any more? <hi>he hath both ſpoken unto me, and he alſo hath done it;</hi> that is, It was God that ſaid to me by his Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt die and not live;</hi> and what he hath ſaid, he hath done; it is he that hath brought me to this extremity, that I am now no better than a dead man; and therefore it is in vain for me thus to complain, to mutter againſt, and ſtrive with my Judge; yea, to what purpoſe is it to call upon God to undertake for me, to eaſe and help me? if he have reſolved that I muſt dye, there's no ſeeking to have it otherwiſe, I muſt ſtoop and yield; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. And indeed ſuch Expreſſions of impatience and deſpair, That it is in vain to pray to God, and to hope for any favour from him, may ſometimes flip from the beſt of Gods ſervants in deſperate dangers, and great diſcompoſures of ſpirit. Thus, I ſay, many do underſtand theſe words. But indeed I ſee not how this can ſuit with the following clauſe, <hi>I ſhall go ſoftly all my years in the bitterneſs of my ſoul,</hi> if we take it as they do, as a complaint that he ſhould go drooping (<hi>ſoftly,</hi> that is, Mournfully; See the Note 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27.) all his years; for how could he ſpeak of living <hi>years</hi> in that condition wherein he concluded that he ſhould not live a day to an end? Rather therefore we may think that <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> having in the foregoing verſes ſet forth the low and hopeleſs Condition wherein
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42788:192"/>
he lay for a while, doth at theſe words begin to relate the wonderful mercy of God to him in his recovery. <hi>What ſhall I ſay?</hi> as if he had ſaid, But alas! how ſhall I be able to expreſs the wonder of Gods love to me, in reſcuing me out of this danger? Sure I ſhall never know how to ſhew my ſelf thankful enough for ſuch a mercy: <hi>he hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it;</hi> that is, He was pleaſed by the ſame Prophet, by whom he pronounced the ſentence of Death againſt me, to ſend me a promiſe that I ſhould recover out of this ſickneſs; and what he hath promiſed, he hath accordingly done: <hi>I ſhall go ſoftly all my years;</hi> that is, Deliberately and conſiderately, ſay ſome, or gently and eaſily, ſay others; <hi>in the bitterneſs of my ſoul;</hi> that is, In the conſtant remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that bitterneſs of ſoul, which I have undergone in this time of my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So that the meaning may be, either 1. That he would be all the remainder of his life often and ſeriouſly calling to mind the bitterneſs of this his late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he might be the more thankful to God for his deliverance: Or, 2ly. That being comforted with the experience of Gods favour to him, he would go on quietly, fearleſly and chearfully all his life long, though he ſhould be aſſailed ſometimes with the fear of death, or any other bitter affliction, as not queſtioning but that God would out of his wonted love be a ſure refuge to him. Or, 3ly. That by the remembrance of that bitterneſs he had been in, and Gods great goodneſs to him in raiſing him upon his Prayers to him ſo ſpeedily out of ſo ſad a Condition, he would be careful to walk all his days as became a true Penitent, <hi>ſoftly,</hi> that is, Penſively and mournfully as to his bewailing the ſins wherewith he had diſpleaſed God; or <hi>ſoftly,</hi> that is, Warily and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly as to his care for the avoiding of every thing whereby he might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and diſpleaſe him for the time to come. Neither indeed can I ſee how this laſt clauſe, as it is in our Tranſlation, can be any other way probably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>O Lord, by theſe things men live,</hi> &amp;c.] This verſe is ſeveral ways tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Interpreters. But according to our Tranſlation the meaning is clearly this, O Lord, by thy favour, and promiſes, by the word of thy command, and by thy providence accompliſhing what thou haſt ſpoken, is the life of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to them, or prolonged as thou pleaſeſt, yea, even to thoſe that were at the brink of the Grave, or that haply had before the ſentence of Death pronounced againſt them (for this is ſpoken with reference to that in the foregoing verſe, <hi>he hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it</hi>) See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>and in all theſe things is the life of my ſpirit;</hi> that is, And by theſe things doth my ſoul ſtill continue within me, chearfully and comfortably enlivening my body; <hi>ſo wilt thou recover me, and make me to live;</hi> that is, And ſo by thy will it is that I am recovered and do live; or ſo thou wilt perfect the work of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery which thou haſt begun, and make me to live that remainder of years thou haſt appointed for me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] Or, <hi>on my peace came great bitterneſs;</hi> that is, When I was healthful and well, and had not the leaſt fear of any diſtemper of ſickneſs that was coming upon me; yea, when by Gods miraculous deſtroying the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, both my ſelf and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeemed to be in a way of ſetled peace; and thereupon I began to promiſe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42788:193"/>
my ſelf, that I ſhould now live the remainder of my days in proſperity and peace, on a ſudden I was ſurprized with this bitter affliction; <hi>but thou haſt in love to my ſoul, delivered it from the pit of corruption;</hi> that is, Out of <hi>thy fatherly love to me</hi> (See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.2.) thou wert pleaſed to recover me, even from the very grave; <hi>for thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back,</hi> to wit, as things loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, which yet thou wert pleaſed to forget and forgive, ſo as never to charge them upon me. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that had before alledged, that he had walked before God in truth, and with a perfect heart, and done that which was good in his ſight, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. doth yet withal acknowledg here, That his ſins had been many, and the cauſe why God had viſited him with his late dangerous ſickneſs; and doth not ſo much rejoyce in his recovery, as in Gods love and pardoning mercy, which was better than a thouſand lives to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>For the grave cannot praiſe thee, death cannot celebrate thee,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.5. and 30.9. and 115.17. Hereby <hi>Hezekiah</hi> intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that he knew that Gods end in reſtoring him to his former health, was, That here in this World he might ſet forth his praiſe; and that this therefore he would certainly do, yea, that upon this account he chiefly rejoyced in his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day,</hi> &amp;c.] The repetition of this word, <hi>the living, the living,</hi> is very Emphatical, and amongſt other things doth clearly diſcover how full of joy his heart was upon the thought of this, that by his recovery he ſhould have ſo fair a ſeaſon afforded him to ſpeak good of Gods name; <hi>the fathers to the children ſhall make known thy truth,</hi> that is, Thy faithfulneſs in performing thy promiſes, as thou haſt now done unto me; they ſhall teach their Children what great things thou haſt done, and how they ought upon ſuch occaſions to extol thy name; and ſo thy Praiſes ſhall be continued from Generation to Generation: yea, theſe words may ſeem probably to imply, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had it now in his thoughts, that by Gods gracious length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of his days, he might come to have a Son to ſucceed him in his Throne, whom he might inſtruct to live to Gods praiſe and glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>The Lord was ready to ſave me, therefore we will ſing my ſongs to the ſtringed inſtruments,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will do it with and in the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of thy people (as indeed <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> recovery was a great bleſſing and a juſt cauſe of thankfulneſs to all the people) and he ſaith, <hi>we will ſing my ſongs,</hi> either as intending the Pſalms which he meant to compoſe, or elſe thoſe Pſalms of Thankſgiving which he and the people uſed to ſing upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>For Iſaiah had ſaid, Let them take a lump of figs,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Hezekiah alſo had ſaid, What is the ſign that I ſhall go up to the houſe of the Lord?]</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.8. it is, <hi>What ſhall be the ſign that the Lord will heal me, and that I ſhall go up into the houſe of the Lord the third day?</hi> But the laſt clauſe is here only mentioned, becauſe this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies how earneſt his deſires were, that he might go up to the Temple to praiſe God for his recovery.</p>

But ſee the Notes for this whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.12. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And Hezekiah was glad of them,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as being vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly joyed with thinking how renowned he was become, even in remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and withal haply as chuckering himſelf with a conceit that by the friendſhip of this King of <hi>Babylon</hi> he ſhould be the ſafer for the future from any further Invaſion of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and if this were ſo, it muſt needs argue that he was not ſo confident in Gods protection, as the remembrance of Gods late mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Deliverance of him from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> might well have made him. But for this and that which follows, <hi>and ſhewed the houſe of his precious things,</hi> See the Note 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>What ſaid theſe men? and from whence came they unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This the Prophet demanded of the King, not becauſe he knew not who they were, and whence they came, but that by the Kings anſwer he might take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deliver the Meſſage which God had given him in charge. As for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>They are come from a far Country,</hi> &amp;c. See the Note, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Then ſaid he, What have they ſeen in thine houſe?</hi> &amp;c.] See the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note; <hi>and Hezekiah anſwered, All that is in mine houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might well have thought, that Gods Prophet uſed not to come unto him, but about very ſerious and weighty matters, and he enquired not of theſe meerly out of curioſity, that he might know what the buſineſs was he was come about; yet by his plain and direct relating what he had done, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he apprehended not that he had ſinned herein, but rather expected to be commended for his wiſe and prudent managing of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine houſe, and that which thy Fathers have laid up in ſtore until this day, ſhall be carried to Babylon,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, All theſe things wherein thou haſt ſo prided thy ſelf, and whereof thou haſt ſo exceedingly gloried, ſhall be plundred and carried away, even by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> whom now by ſo great reſpects thou haſt ſought to engage to thee. A ſad Meſſage this was! But by making known, that this fact of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſhould help forward that dreadful deſolation which indeed was chiefly brought upon the whole Land for the wickedneſs and obſtinacy of the people in general, 1. God diſcovered how hateful and deteſtable the ſin of Pride and Vain glory is in his ſight: And 2ly. he brought <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to humble themſelves for what had been done; as it is expreſly

And by foretelling this, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was further informed how vainly he and his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had chuckered themſelves in the great treaſures they had horded up for their Poſterity, ſeeing both their Treaſures and Poſterity too, were not long after to be carried away into <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Then ſaid Hezekiah to Iſaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus the good King doth quietly ſubmit to the Sentence of God, and to the denunciation of it by the Prophet; <hi>Good,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the word of the Lord;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, It is moſt juſt that God ſhould thus puniſh both my ſin, and the wickedneſs of this people; and I know that what he doth therein, he will do out of fatherly love to thoſe that fear him: <hi>he ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, for there ſhall be peace and truth in my days;</hi> which in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.19. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thus, <hi>Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?</hi> for which ſee the Note there. By <hi>peace and truth,</hi> is meant aſſured peace, or peace with the faithful accompliſhment of what God had promiſed; particularly it may be, that of the lengthning out his days for fifteen years. So that that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> intended hereby, was, That he had cauſe to own it as an effect of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Favour to them, that this Judgment ſhould be ſuſpended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſo long, that during his life, peace ſhould be continued amongſt them; which alſo might hint ſome hope to them, that when the evil threatned was brought upon the Land, God would remember mercy in the midſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>COmfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith your God.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, The Lord God, who doth ſtill own you for his Covenant-people, though he hath ſo ſeverely chaſtiſed you for your ſins, and will ſtill approve himſelf to be <hi>your God,</hi> upon the mention made in the foregoing Chapter of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. (whereby we may ſee how fitly the Stories there related were inſerted in that place) the Prophet addreſſeth himſelf to comfort the people of God with many promiſes of their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and being ſetled again in their own Country; and under this alſo, of our Redemption by Chriſt from that more dreadful Bondage under Sin and Satan, whereof that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42788:194"/>
deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, was a type, or ſhadow; ſo that indeed moſt of the following Prophecies, if not all, even to the end of the Book, are mainly concerning this ſubject, the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and that great work of our Salvation by Chriſt. And it may well be thought, that when the time of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity began to approach, the Prophet wrote this Prophecy purpoſely that during that long and ſad time of their exile, they might have this as a Cordial amongſt them for the chearing of their hearts. In the beginning of this Prophecy, God by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> enjoyns his Prophets, to wit, ſuch as God ſhould raiſe up in the time of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; as namely, <hi>Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, Zachariah</hi> and others, that they ſhould comfort the ſad hearts of his people with the tidings of their approaching deliverance; and eſpecially likewiſe thoſe, that about the time of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, were indued with a Spirit of Prophecy, and ſpake to the people concerning that great myſtery, ſuch as were <hi>Zachary,</hi> old <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> together with the Apoſtles and other Preachers of the Goſpel, that they ſhould comfort poor dejected ſinners with the glad tidings of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Salvation by Chriſt. And herein obſervable alſo it is, 1. That to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what plenty of theſe God would raiſe up after that long time of ſilence, when they had not, in a manner, a Prophet amongſt them (See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9.) this Command is expreſſed in the plural Number, <hi>Comfort ye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye my people.</hi> And 2ly. that it is twice repeated, 1. To ſet forth Gods pity and compaſſion toward his afflicted people. 2ly. To imply how faithfully and ſtrenuouſly God required this work ſhould be done by his Meſſengers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And 3ly. to hint what full, abundant and continual ground of Conſolation was contained in the glad tidings they were to impart to Gods people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Speak ye comfortably to Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Or, the people of God, and Church of Chriſt in general. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>Speak to the heart of Jeruſalem;</hi> whereby is meant, either that they ſhould ſpeak that which might be as pleaſing and delightful to them, as their own hearts could deſire; or rather, that they ſhould ſpeak thoſe things that might affect, comfort and revive their very hearts within them: <hi>and cry unto her,</hi> that is, proclaim to her with much aſſurance and earneſtneſs, <hi>that her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>her appointed time is accompliſhed,</hi> that is, (as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi>) That her Captivity there is at an end; or that the ſet time appointed by God for her deliverance from thence is fully accompliſhed: Or, (as it reſpects the coming of Chriſt to perform that great work of mans Redemption) that his peoples ſervitude under the Law, Satan, Sin and Death, was fully expired; and that the fulneſs of time appointed by God for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt, was come; which is fully the ſame in effect with that of our Saviour, <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> Mark 1.15. <hi>that her iniquity is pardoned,</hi> that is, That God is now reſolved to receive her into his favour, and will proceed no further in a way of puniſhing her, as he hath done; Or, that God will now accept of ſatisfaction from Chriſt, and ſo pardon the ſins of his people: <hi>for ſhe hath received of the Lords hand double for all her ſins;</hi> that is, ſhe hath been abundantly puniſhed for her ſins; for ſo this word <hi>double</hi> is frequently uſed in the Scripture, as afterwards in this Prophecy,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42788:195"/>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 61.7. <hi>for your ſhame ye ſhall have double;</hi> and again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.18. <hi>I will recompence their iniquity and their ſin double:</hi> and ſo likewiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.18. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.12. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6. ſee alſo the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.21. The meaning is not, That the Juſtice of God was fully ſatisfied by her ſufferings; or that ſhe had ſuffered more than her ſins had deſerved (for quite contrary is that Confeſſion of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s, Chap. 9.13. <hi>Our God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve</hi>) but that God would not lay any further or greater Puniſhment upon her, though indeed her ſins had deſerved for more. God ſeems to ſpeak of his people, as pitying them for the great miſeries they had undergone. Alas! my people have endured enough and enough, and more than enough! It is high time they ſhould now be delivered.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.4. where we have a like Expreſſion. It is, as if he had ſaid, Let there be, Or, there ſhall be the voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs. Or we may conceive the Prophet ſpeaking here, as in a prophetical rapture, Methinks I hear <hi>the voice of him that cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th in the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe in the foregoing verſes, by way of foretelling how graciouſly God would ſhortly deal with his people, he had enjoyned his Meſſengers to make known the glad tidings they had for them, <hi>to cry unto her, that her warfare was accompliſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Here now he ſheweth how this ſhould be done by the voice of one that ſhould cry in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Now as this is ſpoken (in the type) of the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to their own Country, the meaning is, That God would order it ſo, that through the favour of <hi>Cyrus</hi> there ſhould be an eaſie and a clear way opened unto them for their return, which had been hitherto blocked up againſt them with many difficulties not like to be removed; and that they who had been carried away as captivated ſlaves, with ſo much ſcorn and contempt, ſhould now return back in an honourable and glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>The voice of him that crieth in the Wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtreight in the deſert a high way for our God;</hi> the words do plainly imply, 1. That the Lord God would go before his people, and carry them home into their own Country. And 2ly. that therefore as Kings, when they are to paſs from one place to another with their Train and Attendants, or to march with their Armies into foreign parts, are wont to have their Harbingers or Fore-runners go before them, to ſet Pioneers and others on work to remove all obſtructions out of their way, and to provide that the way be direct, and fair, and plain before them, as they paſs along; ſo would the Lord provide, that all hinderances ſhould be removed that might obſtruct their return; and that there ſhould be a clear, a fair way ſet open before them. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould bring them to repentance, ſo that their ſins ſhould not hinder their return any longer; and as for other difficulties that might diſcourage them, their ſcattered, poor and deſolate Wilderneſs-condition in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thoſe waſte deſert Countries they were to paſs through in their going homeward to <hi>Judea,</hi> God would order it ſo, that they ſhould have no ſtop nor diſturbance, but all ſhould be carried on with as much facility and expedition, as if ſuch a fair Cawſey-way had been prepared for them, even as in former times their Fore fathers were carried from <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilderneſs into <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:42788:195"/>
the accompliſhment whereof we may ſee, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6. But then as this was ſpoken with reſpect to the coming of Chriſt, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as principally it was, doubtleſs it is meant of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts preaching in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> as is evident in the Evangeliſts, who do expreſly affirm, that in him this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was fulfilled; See <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6. and <hi>John</hi> 1.23. And the meaning is, That the Baptiſt by his preaching the Goſpel in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſhould, as Chriſts Herald or Harbinger, prepare a way by faith and repentance in the hearts of thoſe that heard him, for the receiving of Chriſt that was coming after him, and the Grace of Life and Salvation that in Chriſt, as their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſhould be tendred to them. Though the hearts of men were naturally blocked up againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Chriſt, and more eſpecially by the great corruption of thoſe times; yet by the power of the Baptiſts preaching, all hinderances ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the hearts of multitudes ſhould be ſubdued to the obedience of Chriſt, and he ſhould make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Every valley ſhall be exalted, and every mountain and hill ſhall be made low,</hi> &amp;c.] As this was ſpoken with reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the meaning is, that they ſhould meet with no trouble or difficulty in their way. But now as it reſpects the Baptiſts preaching, the words ſeem to import, that there ſhould be a ſtrange reformation wrought thereby in the hearts of his hearers, even as to thoſe things that did moſt indiſpoſe men to the ready receiving of Chriſt and the Grace of the Goſpel. And ſo, 1. by the exalting of valleys, may be meant, either that men of low and cowardly ſpirits, ſhould be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great courage in embracing and profeſſing the Goſpel; or that men of baſe worldly thoughts ſhould become heavenly-minded; or rather, that the ſinking and deſpairing ſouls of poor ſinners, dejected with ſenſe of their ſins, and the terrors of Gods wrath, ſhould be comforted and raiſed up with hope of Reconciliation with God, and life eternal. 2ly. By laying Hills and Mountains low, may be meant the humbling of proud ſpirits, preſumptuous and highly conceited of their own righteouſneſs, with the terrors of the Law. 3ly. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>crooked ſtraight,</hi> we may underſtand the reforming of the crooked and falſe ways of ungodly men, and making them conformable to the ſtraight Rule of Gods Law. And 4ly. by making <hi>the rough places plain,</hi> may be meant, the bringing of thoſe that are of a rugged and ſtubborn temper, to become mild, and gentle, and pliable to Gods will. And ſummarily, the meaning of all may be, That all ſorts of men ſhould be prepared by the Baptiſts Miniſtry, to ſtoop to the yoke of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this alſo may be, That the glorious power, and mercy, and faithfulneſs of God to his people, ſhould be manifeſtly diſcovered in the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country. And accordingly we may underſtand the following clauſe, <hi>and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together,</hi> to wit, that this work of his peoples deliverance ſhould be ſo wonderful and glorious, that all Nations, all men might ſee; yea, that a man ſhould ſee plainly, that it was the glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Heaven and Earth that had done it, and ſhould ſtand amazed at it; ſo far they ſhould be (poor frail Creatures) from being able to hinder what
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42788:196"/>
God will have done! But now if we underſtand it of the great work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt (to which the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke</hi> applieth it, rendring it according to the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> Luke 3.6. <hi>And all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God</hi>) then the meaning may be either, firſt, That Chriſt, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was the only begotten Son of God the Father, and <hi>the brightneſs of his glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. ſhould after a long time of Expectation be at laſt manifeſted unto the World in mans nature, according to that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</hi> Or, 2ly. that by that wonderful work of mans Redemption by Chriſt, that Myſtery which had been hid from Ages and from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. the tranſcendent Glory of all Gods glorious Attributes, ſhould be manifeſtly and abundantly diſcovered to men; which is further ſet forth in the next words, <hi>and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together;</hi> that is, The Elect, ſay ſome, of all Nations and all ſorts of people; or multitudes of all ſorts and Nations, not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, ſhall ſee this Glory of God in Chriſt, and in the great work of our Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>The voice ſaid, Cry.]</hi> This, as it is in our Tranſlation, ſeems to have relation to that charge given, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people;</hi> as if it had been expreſſed thus: I heard, or methought I heard <hi>the voice</hi> that gave the former charge, ſaying, <hi>Cry.</hi> And therefore it muſt be underſtood either of the voice of God commanding the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to cry; or as a prediction of a voice from God, enjoyning the Prophets a little before the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> or a voice from Chriſt enjoyning his Meſſengers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters after the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, to lift up their voice, and to cry aloud, to wit, with all earneſtneſs and endeavour to make men hear, as it was fit they ſhould do, both in regard of the importance of their meſſage, and the ſtupidity of thoſe to whom they were to ſpeak; or, as thoſe that have very glad tidings are wont to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (for it is uſual with the Prophets to ſpeak of themſelves in the third perſon) or the party to whom this charge from God or from Chriſt ſhall be given, <hi>What ſhall I cry?</hi> And this is added to imply, partly the readineſs of Gods Servants to undertake the ſervice impoſed upon them; and partly their care to ſay nothing in the meſſage they were to deliver, but what they had received diſtinctly and expreſly in charge from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All fleſh is graſs,</hi> &amp;c.] This is that which was to be proclaimed; <hi>All fleſh is graſs,</hi> that is, All men in their natural Eſtate are poor tranſitory and periſhing things; <hi>and all the goodlineſs thereof is as the flower of the field;</hi> or, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> cites it out of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>and all the glory of man, as the flower of graſs;</hi> that is, All that is of greateſt excellency, graceful and glorious in any man whatſoever, and for which men are uſually moſt admired and eſteemed, as when men are endued with excellent natural gifts, as Beauty, Strength, Wiſdom, Learning, Courage; and when men are outwardly above others in Riches and Honours; all are of no more continuance than a fading flower. But, may ſome ſay, Why was this known truth concerning the vanity and frailty of man, and all that is in man, enjoyned here with ſo much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42788:196"/>
to be proclaimed? I anſwer, Many reaſons are given for this by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters; but the moſt probable are theſe: firſt, ſome ſay, That leſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould queſtion the promiſes they ſhould hear from Gods Servants concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords delivering them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe of the mighty power of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> by whom they were held in Captivity; therefore this was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to be proclaimed, to imply, that how dreadful and invincible ſoever the <hi>Babylonians</hi> might ſeem to be, yet if God did ſet himſelf to deſtroy them, they would ſoon be found to be no better than graſs, and as a withering flower. Again others hold, That the drift of this Cry was to hint unto the people of <hi>Judah</hi> their approaching Captivity, that ſo afterward he might proceed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them again of their deliverance from thence; <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof is as the flower of the field;</hi> as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> had ſaid, Though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army your State will ſeem to be in a very flouriſhing Condition, yet alas! All the glory of man is a poor fading thing; it will not be long ere all the glory of your State will be ruined, and you your ſelves will be carried Captives into a far Country; only indeed after this, the Comforts before promiſed you, ſhall ſurely be fulfilled in their ſeaſon. But then thirdly, others (owning mans Redemption by Chriſt, whereof the deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a type, to be the main comfortable tidings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) do accordingly hold, That the Servants of Chriſt are here enjoyned, either to proclaim the baſeneſs of mans natural Condition, that <hi>all fleſh</hi> was <hi>graſs,</hi> &amp;c. thereby to ſet forth the riches of Gods grace, in that he would ſend his only begotten Son to take our Nature upon him; or, that Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming man by ſuch a wonderful way, could not be aſcribed to any worth in man, but only to Gods free grace; or elſe, rather to convince men of their natural corruption, to wit, That of themſelves (unleſs when they are quickned and revived by the ſpirit of grace) they are poor, dying, periſhing Creatures, unable to do any thing toward their recovery out of this Condition, that ſo they might be fit to go out of themſelves, and embrace the Salvation tendred to them in the Goſpel through Jeſus Chriſt. And indeed, till men be made ſenſible of their own loſt Eſtate, they are not capable of the Conſolations which <hi>ver.</hi> 1. were appointed to be propounded to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, As theſe things wither away, if a little ſharp breath of wind doth but blow upon them (See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.16.) ſo when God is but pleaſed in his anger to blow upon men, they and all their glory are ſoon brought to nothing; <hi>ſurely the people is graſs,</hi> that is, All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World are no better than graſs before God; whereby what is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſee in the foregoing Note. Yet it may be more peculiarly meant of Gods own people; to wit, that even they alſo, however they might pride themſelves in their carnal priviledges, had in their natural Eſtate no advantage in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard above others.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever.]</hi> The meaning of this may be in general, that however the Plots and Reſolutions of poor periſhing men might come to nothing, yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Promiſes of God ſhould certainly ſtand firm for ever. But now as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42788:197"/>
this is ſpoken with particular reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that which was intended muſt needs be, either that how firm ſoever the Glory of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy might ſeem, yet that ſhould wither and be ruined, but the word of promiſe which God had ſpoken concerning their return out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and wherewith he had enjoyned his Servants to comfort his people, ſhould ſurely be accompliſhed; or that though the glory of the State of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be brought to nothing in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, yet that ſhould not hinder what God had ſpoken concerning their re-eſtabliſhment again in their own land. And as it hath reference to the days of the Goſpel, the meaning is, either that Gods promiſe and Decree concerning the coming of Chriſt to redeem poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful periſhing man, ſhould certainly be fulfilled; or elſe, that the word of Chriſt, publiſhed by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and received by a lively Faith into the hearts of tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>O Zion, that bringeſt good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be read as it is in the Margin, <hi>O thou that telleſt good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain;</hi> and ſo likewiſe in the following words; <hi>O thou that telleſt good tidings to Jeruſalem, lift up thy voice,</hi> &amp;c. and being thus read, it ſeems to be a repetition of the charge before given, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,</hi> to wit, That they ſhould proclaim to Gods people thoſe glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings wherewith they were appointed to comfort them; for which ſee the Note there. But now reading it as it is in our Text, <hi>O Zion, that bringeſt good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, get thee up into the high mountain;</hi> it is rather <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf, that is, the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (belonging to <hi>Zion,</hi> the place of Gods publick Worſhip, though now Captives in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) that are here enjoyned to ſpread abroad as far as they could (which is implied by willing them to <hi>get up into a high mountain</hi>) the glad tidings they had received concerning the liberty grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country.

of the coming of Chriſt, are here enjoyned to get up into a high Mountain, and to lift up their voice with ſtrength; that is, chearfully, openly, freely and confidently to ſpread abroad the glad tidings of the Goſpel, firſt to <hi>the Cities of Judah,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews, the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Matth. 10.6. but then afterwards even to all Nations throughout the VVorld, without any fear of thoſe that ſhould oppoſe or perſecute them for ſo doing. And this is juſt that which Chriſt ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.27, 28. <hi>What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the houſe tops. And fear not them which kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> And thus underſtanding it, by thoſe words, <hi>Behold, your God,</hi> may be meant, either the Son appearing viſibly in mans nature, as when the Baptiſt pointed him out to the people, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the World;</hi> or elſe meerly his coming into the World to accompliſh that great work of mans Redemption, which they had ſo long expected.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come with ſtrong hand,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be read as in the Margin, <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come againſt the ſtrong,</hi> that is, Againſt the mighty enemies of his people, the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> Or, taking it as ſpoken of Chriſt againſt the Devil, who is called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29. <hi>the ſtrong man</hi> that was to be ſubdued by Chriſt, and caſt out of his houſe. But indeed the ſenſe is the ſame, if we read it as it is in our Text, <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come with ſtrong hand;</hi> for if we refer it to the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the meaning is, That God would appear with his Almighty power for the Deſtruction of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that ſo his people mighe have liberty to return into their own Country. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>and his arm ſhall rule for him;</hi> that is, By his own all-ſufficient power he ſhall exerciſe that Dominion that belongs to him over all the Creatures, by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his peoples enemies, and delivering them; <hi>behold, his reward is with him,</hi> that is, He will immediately without delay reward the proud <hi>Babylonians</hi> for all their wickedneſs; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.8. and 35.4. and make his people amends for their patient waiting upon him, during the time of their Captivity; which is again repeated in the laſt clauſe, if we read it as it is in the Margin, <hi>and the recompence for his work before him:</hi> but if we read it as it is in our Text, <hi>and his work before him,</hi> the meaning is, That the work which he intended to do, both in delivering his people and deſtroying their enemies, lay plain and open before him, there being nothing that could lye as an Obſtacle in his way, that could hinder him. And this may alſo imply that which ſome think is here chiefly intended, that they, to whom he intended a recompence of evil and good, lay naked and open before him, and were exactly known by him, ſo that he could fully proportion a reward according to the evil or good that he found in them. Thus, I ſay, this verſe is to be underſtood, as it hath reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But now as it hath reſpect to that which was figured thereby, Chriſt coming into the World to redeem his choſen people, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus, <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come with ſtrong hand, and his arm ſhall rule for him;</hi> that is, the Lord Chriſt will come with infinite power to vanquiſh thoſe ſpiritual enemies under whom his people were held in bondage, and to redeem his people out of their power; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42788:198"/>
of which even the Miracles that he wrought in caſting out Devils, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Dead to life, &amp;c. were ſome diſcovery beforehand, with reſpect whereto it is ſaid, that he was <hi>mighty in word and deed before God and all the people,</hi> Luke 24.19. <hi>his reward is with him,</hi> that is, he will puniſh the Devil and his Servants with eternal Damnation; and thoſe that embrace him and ſerve him faithfully, he will abundantly reward, both here and eternally in his heavenly Kingdom: <hi>and his work before him;</hi> that is, He will be earneſtly intent upon the work which his Father ſhall ſend him to do; to wit, the work of mans Redemption; for ſo Chriſt uſed often to ſpeak of it, as <hi>John</hi> 4.34. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> And 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Some, I know, do otherwiſe underſtand the latter part of this verſe; for ſome by <hi>his reward,</hi> do underſtand the ranſome paid by him for mans Redemption; and ſome hold, that his redeemed ones are here ſaid to be both his work and reward; See <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.11. and 60.21. But the former Expoſition I judge the beſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Having gathered together his poor captived people, that were diſperſed abroad into ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Countries, he will with all care and tenderneſs carry them home to their own Countrey in one body, defending them, and providing for them all the way they go thorough thoſe waſte places by which they muſt paſs, and likewiſe after they are gotten home; ſo that the weakeſt and the tendereſt amongſt them, ſhall receive no prejudice by their Journey; which is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the following words, <hi>he ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young;</hi> that is, He will cheriſh them with all tenderneſs, as a Shepherd deals with the feeble in his flock, that when his Lambs are yeaned far off from the fold, or are wandred abroad, or wearied with driving, is wont to take them into his arms or lap and carry them home; and when the Ews are feeble and wearied, is very careful not to over drive them, See <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.13. And ſo likewiſe under this is ſet forth Chriſts tender care over his Church and people, to defend them, and to provide for them, and to guide and govern them; and particularly, the tender reſpect he hath to his little ones, his poor weak ones, and thoſe that are burdened with any heavy load of ſin, affliction and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Who, but God? The Prophet doth here largely undertake to ſet forth the infinite and incomprehenſible Power, and Wiſdom, and Majeſty of God, by that great work of his creating the world; his Wiſdom in that he made thoſe vaſt bodies of the Heaven, the Earth and Sea, in ſuch due order and proportion, as if he had made them all by weight and meaſure; his Power, in that when he made theſe vaſt bodies, the Sea, the Heaven, the Earth, they were as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his hand; whence it is ſaid that he meaſured the Sea <hi>in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the Heaven with a ſpan, and comprehended the duſt of the earth</hi> (ſo he calls the vaſt globe of the earth, to imply, that it was all but as a little light duſt before God) <hi>in a meaſure (a tierce</hi> it is in the Hebrew, which was, it ſeems, ſome ſmall meaſure with them) and weighed the Mountains and Hills in the ſcales of a little balance. And this the Prophet doth, thereby to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42788:198"/>
ſhew, either 1. That there was no cauſe why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould queſtion the accompliſhment of what God had promiſed concerning the ruine of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> and their deliverance from their bondage under them, out of a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fear of their ſeeming invincible power, or any thing which their Idol-gods could do for them; for alas! What were theſe before that great God, to whom the making of the whole World was a work of no difficulty at all? Or 2ly. That men had no reaſon to queſtion the myſteries of the Goſpel in the work of mans Redemption, becauſe they cannot comprehend the poſſibility of them; and that becauſe we may be ſure the God that created the World can do whatever he pleaſeth. Some indeed think, that this large Deſcription of the greatneſs of God, is to ſet forth the wonder of Chriſts Incarnation, to wit, that this great God ſhould vouchſafe to be made man. But the account that is before given of the Prophets ſcope in this place, is far more generally approved by Expoſitors.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Who, by any Advice or Counſel given him, did direct God in the doing of any thing that he did in the Worlds Creation? And this is added more fully yet, to ſet forth the infinite and incomprehenſible Wiſdom of God; and thereby yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imply, That it is a folly for men to queſtion any thing which God ſaith he will do, becauſe they cannot conceive how it ſhould be done. By the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World we may ſee, that God can do thoſe things which are far above the reach of our underſtanding. By the <hi>Septuagint</hi> this is tranſlated, <hi>Who hath known the mind of the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly it is cited by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. to prove the unſearchableneſs of the Goſpel Myſteries by mans natural underſtanding. And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34. to prove the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of his Counſels.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>With whom took he counſel, and who inſtructed him and taught him in the path of Judgment?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, In the way how to frame or order the Creatures which he made with ſuch admirable Judgment, and Wiſdom, and Underſtanding, or to govern them when he had made them? The drift of this is the ſame with that in the foregoing verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Behold, the Nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] That is, They are of no more worth, or power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or in compariſon of God. And what therefore cannot that God do, who is ſo infinitely great? Or, how can any Nation hinder any thing that God will have done? <hi>behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing;</hi> that is, He can, if he pleaſeth, take them up and throw them away; he can overturn and deſtroy them, and that eaſily and in a moment. Becauſe Iſlands are commonly eſteemed places of greateſt ſtrength; and the Inhabitants think themſelves moſt ſafe and ſecure therein, as being compaſſed with the Sea; therefore theſe are particularly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And Lebanon is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt-offering.]</hi> To wit, if men would think to offer up to God a burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, perfectly beſitting his Majeſty, and fully proportionable to his greatneſs. And the drift of this is ſtill to ſet forth the infinite and incomprehenſible greatneſs of God. Yet ſome think it may be added more particularly to imply, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42788:199"/>
ſhort man muſt needs come of finding out any means to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, which is the ſubject of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>All Nations before him are as nothing,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, In his ſight and account, or in compariſon of him; <hi>and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9. But the drift of this is the ſame with that before, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>To whom then will ye liken God,</hi> &amp;c.] This alſo tends to ſet forth the incomprehenſible Majeſty of God; and that ſtill thereby to imply how little cauſe they had to diſtruſt or doubt of the promiſes of this their God becauſe of the power of any Heathen people that had none but Idol-gods to reſt upon. God had, indeed, made uſe of theſe Nations to puniſh them for their ſins; but alas! when God had a purpoſe again to reſcue his people out of their hands, neither they nor their gods were any thing before him. This, I conceive, is the main ſcope of this place. But yet it is clear, that together with this, the Prophet intended hereby to ſecure his people, that did already, or ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after live as Captives amongſt thoſe Idolatrous Nations, from being corrupted with this brutiſh and abominable ſin.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The workman melteth a graven Image,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken by way of deriding the brutiſh folly of thoſe that can undertake to make themſelves gods; <hi>and the Goldſmith ſpreadeth it over with Gold, and caſteth Silver chains,</hi> to wit, to be an Ornament to it; or elſe, to faſten it therewith ſomewhere aloft that it may not fall or ſtir, but ſtand bolt-upright.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>He that is ſo impoveriſhed that he hath no oblation,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That hath no ſuch rich oblation, as is before mentioned, to be conſecrated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the making of a God for him, to wit, Gold, or Silver, or Braſs; <hi>chooſeth a tree that will not rot,</hi> (which is ſpoken by way of deriſion) <hi>he ſeeketh unto him a cunning workman, to prepare a graven image that it ſhall not be moved;</hi> that is, That may ſtand a long time, there being no need to take it down, becauſe it is periſhed and decayed; Or, that may be ſo faſtned by the Workman, that it may not be in danger to totter or fall down.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Have ye not known,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, That God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, is the only true God, and of that infinite Majeſty, that he cannot be repreſented by any Image? As if he had ſaid, Surely you cannot but know this: <hi>have ye not heard?</hi> that is, Hath no body ever told you thus much? Or, have not ye, my people, been taught this out of my written word? <hi>hath it not been told you from the beginning?</hi> have ye not received this by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from your Fathers ſucceſſively in all Generations, even from the firſt Creation? Or, have ye not been told this even from your Childhood? or from the beginning of Gods revealing himſelf to your Nation, as his peculiar people? As if he had ſaid, This is no new Doctrine; even from the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> ye have been taught this: <hi>have ye not underſtood from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth?</hi> that is, ſay ſome, From the time when the Foundations of the earth were firſt laid? But rather the drift of theſe words is to ſhew, that this truth concerning the infinite Majeſty of the only true God, was ſufficiently diſcovered to all men by the Creation of the World, or particularly by the ſtrange Foundations whereon God hath unmoveably ſetled the earth from the Creation unto this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:42788:199"/>Ver. 22. <hi>It is he that ſitteth upon the circle of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That hath the Heaven for his Throne, and the earth for his footſtool, <hi>Chap.</hi> 66.1. the moſt high God, that is infinitely above all, the Sovereign Lord, Poſſeſſor and Governour of the whole earth and the fulneſs thereof. But now this may be read as it is in the Margin, <hi>Him that ſitteth upon the Circle of the earth;</hi> and then it muſt be read, as joyned to the foregoing verſe, thus; <hi>have ye not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him that ſitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are as Graſhoppers?</hi> to wit, even as to men that ſtand aloft on ſome high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, things beneath ſeem very little (for to this there is an Alluſion in theſe words) <hi>that ſtretcheth out the heavens as a curtain;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. <hi>and ſpreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;</hi> that is, ſay moſt Expoſitors, for men to dwell in, who are under the Canopy of Heaven, as the covering of a Tent; or rather, as a Pavilion, or palace for himſelf to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>That bringeth the Princes to nothing; he maketh the Judges of the earth as vanity.]</hi> That is, He maketh the great Kings and Rulers of the earth to appear to be as nothing, and meer vanity before him; or by deſtroying them, he brings them to nothing, See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 12.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Yea, they ſhall not be planted, yea they ſhall not be ſown, yea their ſtock ſhall not take root in the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, In what a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition ſoever theſe great ones ſeem to be, they ſhall be deſtroyed, as eaſily and utterly, without any memorial of them left behind them, as thoſe things are overthrown or blaſted, that never had any root in the earth; as namely, a dry, dead ſtock of a tree put into the earth; or as graſs, that ſhooting up of it ſelf in the ſuperficies of the earth, and not having any deep root, is ſoon withered. Some, I know, underſtand this of their being overturned in the beginning of their Reign, before they are well ſetled in their greatneſs, or before they have any Poſterity to leave behind them. But the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I judge the better, and moſt agreeable to that which followeth, <hi>and he ſhall alſo blow upon them, and they ſhall wither,</hi> &amp;c. that is, The leaſt breath of Gods diſpleaſure ſhall ſoon bring them to nothing; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.16.</p>

               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Lift up your eyes on high,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, heavenward, as becomes men whom God hath created with erect bodies, and countenances fit to view the Heavens; and not like the Beaſts that have their faces always groveling towards the earth: <hi>and behold who hath created theſe things,</hi> to wit, theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Orbs, and the glorious lights therein: Conſider of what infinite Power, and Wiſdom, and Majeſty that God muſt needs be, that hath made all theſe things, <hi>that bringeth out their hoſt by number, he calleth them all by names:</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.4. <hi>by the greatneſs of his might, for that he is ſtrong in power, not one faileth;</hi> that is, By reaſon of his infinite power, when he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out this his heavenly Hoſt, it is not with him as with other Generals, that when they lead out their Companies into the Fields, do uſually miſs ſome of their Souldiers; not one of his Hoſt from the Creation unto this time, hath ever been wanting; but they have all been found in their places, ready preſſed to do whatever God ſhall enjoyn them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:42788:200"/>Ver. 27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeakeſt, O Iſrael?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Conſidering the infinite Power and Wiſdom of God before deſcribed, why ſhould you ever and anon break forth into ſuch words of deſpair, that are Gods Covenant-people, his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob;</hi> who becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon God, being in danger of an enemy too mighty for him, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Iſrael? my way is hid from the Lord,</hi> that is, (ſay the moſt of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors) God takes no notice of, or doth not regard the Miſeries we endure in <hi>Babylon; and my judgment is paſſed over from my God,</hi> that is, He paſſeth over my cauſe, and minds it not, and ſo he doth not execute Judgment upon thoſe that wrong and oppreſs me. Well, but now the words may be underſtood another way, and that very probably, <hi>My way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God,</hi> that is, God himſelf cannot find out a way now to deliver us out of our Captivity; the way of judging and avenging us upon our enemies, is ſo far paſt all hope of being effected, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot redreſs it; See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 3.23. And indeed this Expoſition ſome do rather approve, becauſe of that which is added in the following verſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>Haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not?</hi> to wit, as men uſually do, when their ſtrength is worn out with long toil and labor. Gods not fainting is alledged to imply covertly, that he was able to do as great and wonderful things for his people, as he had ever formerly done, as being never wearied with what he doth: and with reſpect hereto it is, that God is termed here <hi>the everlaſting God;</hi> that is, That God, who from Eternity to Eternity continueth always the ſame unchangeably; and <hi>the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth,</hi> to imply, that being therefore Omnipotent, and having the whole World, even to the utmoſt ends of the earth, as being the work of his hands, under his power and command, to govern it as he pleaſeth, it muſt needs follow, that this immutable God, that ceaſed not to govern the whole World, would much leſs ceaſe to take care of his own Church and people; and that he was able to deliver his people, even in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and from the uttermoſt ends of the earth, as well as if they had been ſtill in the land of <hi>Judea: there is no ſearching of his underſtanding:</hi> as if he had ſaid, And how then can you think, that your way ſhould be hid from ſuch infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg? Or, why ſhould you not think, when you do not underſtand how that which God doth, ſhould tend to the good of his people, that this may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wiſdom of his Proceedings may be far above your reach?</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>He giveth power to the faint,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, to thoſe that are ready to faint and ſink under great Afflictions and Temptations, as being no way able to help themſelves, as it was indeed with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. Such as theſe, and that have humble thoughts of themſelves, God doth uſually ſtrengthen them, and revive; and is it likely that he ſhould faint himſelf, that revives the fainting ſpirits of others?</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>Even the youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fall.]</hi> That is, The ſtrongeſt that are, may, and do often, for want of ſtrength to hold out, fail of effecting what they undertake; which is the rather
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42788:200"/>
ſaid, becauſe ſuch, out of the high conceit they have of their own ſtrength, are many times emboldned to undertake things too high for them, and ſo are ruined thereby.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>But they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c.] The word in the Hebrew may be tranſlated, <hi>ſhall change their ſtrength;</hi> but the meaning is, That they that truſt in God, and wait patiently and quietly upon him for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his promiſes, though they may ſometimes be ready to faint, yet being ſtrengthned by grace, ſhall again encourage themſelves, and go on chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, reſting upon God for Deliverance: <hi>they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles;</hi> that is, By mounting up in their Meditations concerning their God, and all his Glorious Attributes, and the Glory which in Heaven he hath prepared for his people; they ſhall with great courage and magnanimity of Spirit, raiſe up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above all Difficulties, and Dangers, and Fears, and with much confidence reſt upon God, even againſt all oppoſition that may ſeem to threaten them in their way. But ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.5. <hi>They ſhall run, and not be weary: and they ſhall walk, and not faint:</hi> that is, Though the accompliſhment of Gods Promiſes to them be never ſo long delayed, and though they meet with never ſo much Diſcouragement; yet reſting confidently upon God, they ſhall hold out to the end, and couragiouſly run the Race that is ſet before them.</p>

The ſcope of this Chapter is much the ſame with that in the foregoing Chapter, to wit, to make known to the <hi>Jews</hi> with what confidence they might expect that deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which God had before promiſed them, and doth here again aſſure them of (and ſo likewiſe that Redemption by Chriſt, whereof that deliverance was a type) and what little cauſe they had to fear that any power of that Heathen people, or their Idol-gods, ſhould be able to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point God of doing that for his people which he had promiſed.

Now according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here in the beginning of this Chapter, God by the Prophet (as is evident, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) challengeth all the Heathen Nations round about, to enter into a fair and equal debate with him, that when he had pleaded his cauſe, and they had anſwered what they had to ſay for themſelves, it might be judged and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether God had not in all Ages done that for his people, as they had often found to their coſt, which none of their Idol-gods were ever able to do; and conſequently whether there was not very juſt ground why his people ſhould quietly expect the

accompliſhment of that which God had promiſed to do for them, without fearing anything their Idol-gods could do to hinder him therein: <hi>Keep ſilence before me, O Iſlands,</hi> to wit, that you may hear what I ſhall ſay; <hi>and let the people renew their ſtrength,</hi> that is, Let them take courage, and ſtrengthen themſelves with all the Arguments they can; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.31. <hi>Let them come near, then let them ſpeak;</hi> that is, Let them except what they can againſt what I ſay, and ſay what they can for themſelves, and for their Idol-gods that cannot ſpeak for themſelves; <hi>Let us come near together to Judgment,</hi> that is, Let us with fair and equal terms on both ſides debate the matter, that our Cauſe may be judged and determined. And thus he gives the <hi>Jews</hi> to underſtand, that the very Heathens might be convinced of the truth of that which he had now to ſay, if they would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Who raiſed up the righteous man from the eaſt?]</hi> To wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom God called out of <hi>Ur</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> that lay Eaſtward of <hi>Judea,</hi> raiſing his heart effectually to deteſt the Idolatry of the place where he lived, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to obey Gods command for the leaving of his Country and Kindred, to go to the Country whereto he would carry him; and who is called here <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man;</hi> becauſe being juſtified by faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. he did afterward approve himſelf a truly righteous man, by continuing conſtant in the Worſhip of the only true God, and by the general Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all other regards: <hi>called him to his foot,</hi> that is, To follow God whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would lead him, not knowing at all whither it would be; even as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being bidden, follow their Maſter, though they know not whither he will carry them; and being likewiſe afterwards ready to go to and fro, as God was pleaſed to appoint him, <hi>gave the Nations before him, and made him rule over Kings;</hi> to wit, by vanquiſhing them; See the Note before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.10. <hi>he gave them as the duſt to his ſword, and as driven ſtubble to his bow;</hi> that is, He did as eaſily rout and ſubdue them, as duſt or ſtubble is driven away or ſcattered by the wind. And all this is ſpoken, though more eſpecially of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to that victory of his over the four Kings that had plundred <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14. yet incluſively alſo of his Poſterity, and of the many Kings whom they conquered and ſubdued; and all this to ſhew with what aſſured confidence the <hi>Jews</hi> at preſent might rely upon their God, and how little cauſe they had to fear the idolatrous Nations, or their Idol-gods, if they would conſider what God had done for their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo for his Poſterity ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively: <hi>Who raiſed up the righteous man from the Eaſt?</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid, who but the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> did this? Or, which of the Heathen gods ever did the like? And therefore why ſhould <hi>Abrahams</hi> Poſterity queſtion the deliverance promiſed them? When he was in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> God carried him ſafely through many dangers into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and did afterward do great things for his Poſterity; and now you are in bondage in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> why may not God do the ſame for you? I know well, that many learned Expoſitors do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who, ſay they, was raiſed out of the Eaſt, that is, <hi>Perſia;</hi> that lay Eaſtward of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is ſtiled <hi>the righteous man,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe he did juſtly and faithfully what God would have done in executing vengeance upon the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ſetting Gods people free, and ſending them home into
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42788:201"/>
their own Country. And again, others underſtand it of Chriſt; <hi>the holy one, and the juſt,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.14. and who by the Goſpel hath vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdued many Nations. But the former Expoſition concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> I conceive is far moſt probable; only Chriſt may be included in <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whoſe ſeed he came.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>He purſued them, and paſſed ſafely,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Abraham</hi> purſued the Kings before mentioned with ſafety and ſucceſs, and without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſs or damage to him or his followers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.15. <hi>even by the way that he had not gone with his feet,</hi> that is, In remote Countries where he had never been, and muſt needs therefore be unacquainted with their ways. But in this alſo, that which he did in his Poſterity, may alſo be included. See the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Who hath wrought and done it?</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, all before mentioned concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Children ſucceſſively in all Generations; and with reſpect thereto therefore it follows, <hi>calling the Generations from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> that is, Who, according to his eternal fore-knowledg and decree, hath from the beginning of the World, made and raiſed up the Nations of the World in their ſeveral Generations (which the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. expreſſeth thus, <hi>and calleth thoſe things which be not, as if they were</hi>) and hath ordered and diſpoſed of them as he pleaſed; and ſo amongſt others, the Poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> making them a great and numerous people, and doing great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things for them in their ſeveral Ages and Generations. It is as if he had ſaid, It was none of your Idol-gods that did this, or were able to do it, but I the Lord Jehovah, whom alone he and his faithful Poſterity have always wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. <hi>I the Lord, the firſt, and with the laſt I am he;</hi> that is, I the eternal and ever-living God, who having my being of my ſelf, was before all things; and that ſhall govern and diſpoſe of all things to the laſt, and ſubſiſt after all things have an end; the firſt cauſe and the laſt end of all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. it is I that have done all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The Iſles ſaw it, and feared, the ends of the earth were afraid,</hi> &amp;c.] Some apply this particularly to the aſtoniſhment of the Nations afar off, when they heard of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Victory over the Kings that had invaded the plain of <hi>Sodom,</hi> mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. But I ſee no likelihood how that victory could be ſuch a terror to Nations ſo remote, as ſeems here to be intended. However, ſhould that be included, certainly it muſt be principally meant of the wonderful works which God wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their prevailing over the Kings that oppoſed them, when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carried them into <hi>Canaan;</hi> to wit, that when the inhabitants of remote Countries (ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) ſaw what God had done for this his people, they were amazed and affrighted (ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.15. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.1.) Or, that they ſaw that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that had done theſe things, was the true God, and that their Idols were nothing, and were ſtartled at this. As for the following words, that they <hi>drew near and came,</hi> they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew, that though they were thus far convinced, yet they would not ſtoop and yield; but that either they combined and gathered themſelves together to fight againſt the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> or elſe, that they aſſembled together to encourage
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42788:202"/>
one another in their Idolatry; which laſt agreeth beſt with that which follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. concerning their eagerneſs to make new Idols.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>They helped every one his neighbour, and every one ſaid to his Brother, Be of good courage.]</hi> That is, Notwithſtanding their fore-mentioned Conviction and Aſtoniſhment, yet they continued obſtinately in their Idolatry, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged one another to oppoſe and fight againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for whom they ſaw God had done ſuch wonderful things; or to hold faſt to their former Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to proceed on to the making of new Idols.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>So the Carpenter encouraged the Goldſmith,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to make ready, and bring the Gold or Silver plates wherewith the wooden Idol which he had made, was to be overlaid; <hi>and he that ſmootheth with the hammer, him that ſmote the anvil;</hi> that is, He that poliſheth the plate, encouraged him that wrought at the Forge; <hi>ſaying, It is ready for the ſodering;</hi> that is, It is now ſufficiently bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out at the Anvil; and now it is fit to joyn the pieces together with ſoder, that they may be fairly poliſhed; or this clauſe may be read as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>ſaying of the ſoder, it is good;</hi> that is, Having joyned and ſodered the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, they were wonderfully well pleaſed, and delighted with their work, ſaying, So, ſo, this is very handſom, the pieces are neatly ſodered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>and he faſtned it with nails, that it ſhould not be moved;</hi> that is, The Workman faſtned with nails, either the frame or plates ſodered together, to the wooden ſtock underneath it, that the pieces might hold the firmer together; or the Idol it ſelf, being thus finiſhed, to ſome nail or poſt, that it may ſtand faſt; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.19, 20. The ſcope of this whole paſſage was to ſhew, That the Nations being thus eargerly bent to go on in their Idolatry, the Workmen, whoſe Trade it was to make Idols, were very ready to take hold of this opportunity to be ſet on work for the forging of new Gods for them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>But thou, Iſrael, art my ſervant, Jacob whom I have choſen, the ſeed of Abraham my friend.]</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> is called, becauſe of his frequent commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and covenanting with God. Having hitherto ſhewed, purpoſely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to comfort the <hi>Jews,</hi> That the Heathens themſelves could not ſay, that ever their Idol-gods had done ſuch great things for them, as he the Lord had done for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity; hereupon now he addreſſeth his ſpeech directly to them, and with many affectionate Expreſſions of love, perſwades them not to fear their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which God had now promiſed them; and conſequently alſo that greater Deliverance by Chriſt, whereof the other was a type.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Thou, whom I have taken from the ends of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of Gods bringing up the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and accordingly they alſo underſtand the following words, <hi>and called thee from the chief men thereof,</hi> of the King and Nobles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of whoſe hands God delivered the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi> But it is rather meant as with reference to what was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. of Gods bringing the <hi>Jews,</hi> to wit, in the loins of <hi>Abraham,</hi> out of <hi>Chaldea;</hi> and of Gods chuſing <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Father of his people, rather than of the great ones in the Country; and them, his Poſterity, to be his peculiar people, rather than any of the great and mighty Nations in the World beſides; <hi>and ſaid
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:42788:202"/>
unto thee, Thou art my ſervant;</hi> that is, I took thee to be my Covenant-people, that thou ſhouldeſt ſerve me according to the Law I gave thee; <hi>I have choſen thee, and not caſt thee away;</hi> that is, I have not rejected and paſſed by thee, as I did others; or rather, ſince I took thee to be my people, I have never forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee, or caſt thee off, as many times thou haſt given me juſt cauſe to do.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not diſmaied, for I am thy God,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though thou comeſt to be in never ſo ſad and forlorn Condition, yet be not diſmayed; <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, with my righteous right hand, to wit, mine Almighty power, wherewith I will faithfully make good my promiſes, delivering thee, and executing juſt Vengeance on all thine Enemies: only we muſt remember that what is promiſed here to the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt all along alſo be extended to Believers under the Goſpel, the true ſeed of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Behold, all they that were incenſed againſt thee, ſhall be aſhamed and confounded,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Be they never ſo many, they ſhall be all overthrown, even the mightieſt of them; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſeek them, and ſhalt not find them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, They ſhall be utterly deſtroyed; ſo that there ſhall be no danger of their recovering themſelves to trouble thee again.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will be, as it were, thy Confederate; See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.21. Or rather, I will be thine aid upon all Occaſions; as when a man takes his Friend by the hand, and undertakes to lead him on his way, to ſtand by him, to ſupport, defend, and help him; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. Or, I will make thee couragious and ſtrong, <hi>ſaying unto thee, Fear not,</hi> &amp;c. that is, chearing thee up by my Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Fear not, thou worm Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though thou art a poor deſpicable people in thine own eye, and in the Judgment of others, caſt down to the very earth (ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 25.6. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.) yet be not afraid. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>and ye men of Iſrael,</hi> that is, Though ye be but poor mortal men, and but few in number, in compariſon of your enemies (for ſo ſome read it as it is in the Margin, <hi>ye few men of Iſrael</hi>) yet fear them not.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Behold, I will make thee a new ſharp threſhing Inſtrument, having teeth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As poor a worm as thou art, thou ſhalt break thine enemies in pieces, even as <hi>a new ſharp threſhing Inſtrument having teeth</hi> (of which ſee the Notes before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.27, 28.) doth break the ſtraw and chaff in threſhing the Corn when being <hi>new;</hi> it is therefore the ſtronger and ſharper, the pegs or teeth not having been yet worn or blunted; <hi>thou ſhalt threſh the mountains, and beat them ſmall, and ſhalt make the hills as chaff;</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt ſubdue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the greateſt, the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tieſt and mightieſt of thine enemies. But when, after this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah's,</hi> did the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> do this? I anſwer, 1. Some ſay this was accompliſhed when the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were deſtroyed; becauſe though the <hi>Jews</hi> did not do it, yet God did it upon their Prayers, and for their ſakes.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42788:203"/>
2ly. Some underſtand it of thoſe glorious victories which God at ſome times gave the <hi>Jews</hi> over their enemies after their return from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in the days of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> And 3ly. others hold it is meant of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of Chriſt and his people in the days of the Goſpel, both ſpiritual in the ſubduing of all nations, and bringing them under the Dominion of Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>that ſharp threſhing inſtrument,</hi> which pierceth to the very ſoul, and breaks the hard hearts of the moſt obſtinate ſinners; and external, when the Church hath wonderfully broken her Adverſaries in pieces, even <hi>like the chaff of the ſummer threſhing-floors,</hi> Dan. 2.35. Yea, and ſome alſo take in the Saints judging the wicked together with Chriſt at the laſt day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. And indeed I conceive theſe Victories of Chriſt and his people in Goſpel-times, is chiefly here intended; concerning which ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt fan them, and the wind ſhall carry them away, and the whirl-wind ſhall ſcatter them,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou ſhalt not only vanquiſh them and break them in pieces, but alſo diſperſe and ſcatter them; <hi>and thou ſhalt rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, as acknowledging the Glory of all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt; I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them,]</hi> That is, Becauſe I am their God, I will provide for them. And this may be meant of Gods taking care of the poor afflicted <hi>Jews,</hi> either whilſt they were Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where moſt of them were in a very poor Condition, deſtitute of all things neceſſary, even as men ready to periſh for thirſt, and no way able to ſupply themſelves in their wants; or elſe in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn homeward from <hi>Babylon,</hi> when indeed they went through many dry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; to wit, That God would provide that they ſhould not periſh for want of a ſupply of whatever ſhould be neceſſary for them. But withal, I conceive it is principally meant of Chriſts refreſhing poor ſouls troubled for ſin, and ſcorched with the fear of Gods fiery indignation; poor in Spirit, and thirſting after Righteouſneſs with the reviving Conſolations of his Goſpel and Spirit, which indeed are no where elſe to be found.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, In all places high and low, Hills and Valleys; yea, in the moſt deſert places, as it follows in the next words, <hi>I will make the wilderneſs a pool of water,</hi> &amp;c. But the meaning is, That rather than the Lord would not ſupply his peoples wants (according to what is ſaid in the foregoing Note) yea, and that abundantly too; he would provide for them in a ſupernatural and miraculous way; yea, and under this there is alſo a promiſe made of thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters wherewith in the days of the Goſpel the ſouls of poor ſinners all the World over, yea even amongſt the Gentiles, ſhould obtain that refreſhing which was no where elſe to be had. But for this, ſee the Note, Chap. 35.6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>I will plant in the wilderneſs the Cedar, the Shittah-tree,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, a chief ſort of Cedar, as it is commonly ſaid of the wood whereof the boards and the utenſils of the Tabernacle were made; See the Note <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.5. <hi>and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42788:203"/>
the myrtle and the oyl-tree,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the Olive-tree; or more generally, as ſome will have it, any tree of the fruit whereof Oyl is made. The meaning is, That God by his Providence would ſo provide for his people, that their paſſage homeward from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Judea,</hi> ſhould be as commodious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, even when they travelled through the wildeſt deſerts, as if the way had been all along planted with ſtore of pleaſant ſhadowy trees under which they might ſhelter themſelves from the ſcorching of the Sun. But now as this is to be referred to Goſpel-times, it muſt needs ſignifie the enlargement of the Church, and the propagation of the Goſpel, even amongſt the Gentiles that were before as a wild and barren Wilderneſs, amongſt whom there ſhould be many men of eminent gifts and graces, trees of Righteouſneſs, as they are called, <hi>Chap.</hi> 61.3. or there ſhould be in the Church plenty of ſpiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Gifts and Graces, that ſhould be a ſhelter to men againſt the ſcorching heat of Temptations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>That they may ſee, and know, and conſider and underſtand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, The things before mentioned I will do, that all men, not mine own people only, but the Gentiles alſo, may upon due conſideration be together full ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I the Lord Jehovah, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have done theſe things for my people, and ſo may be ſatisfied concerning mine Almighty power, in that my works have been far above what any Idol-gods have been able to do, and concerning my love to, and care over my peculiar people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Produce your cauſe, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Here God by the Prophet returns to his Plea with the Heathen idolatrous Nations, begun <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and having hitherto pleaded his own cauſe againſt them, and ſhewn what he had done and would do for his people; here now he challengeth the Idol-gods, ſay ſome, that they ſhould plead their cauſe, and prove themſelves Gods; or the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Nations, that they ſhould ſay what they could for their Idols: <hi>Produce your cauſe,</hi> that is, Propound your cauſe, that it may be fairly tried; <hi>bring forth your ſtrong reaſons;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, You that are wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the ſimplicity of my people for their confidence in an inviſible God, let us now hear your ſtrong unanſwerable Arguments and Demonſtrations (which is ſpoken in a way of deriſion) to prove the Deity of your Idol-gods. All which is ſtill ſpoken, not only to forewarn Gods own people to beware of ſuch Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; but alſo to ſhew them, that they had no cauſe to fear that either the <hi>Babylonians</hi> or their Idol-gods could hinder their promiſed return into their own Country. And this he concludes with an expreſs aſſerting that this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the King of <hi>Iſrael: bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of Jacob;</hi> partly for the greater comfort of his people, and partly by way of deriding their Idol-gods, that could not as Kings defend the people that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped them, as he the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Let them bring them forth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Let the Nations bring forth their Idol-gods, that we may hear what they can ſay for themſelves; or rather, let the Idol-gods bring forth their <hi>ſtrong reaſons,</hi> of which mention was made in the foregoing verſe, to prove themſelves Gods. And accordingly in the next words there is one particular way propounded, whereby they are required
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42788:204"/>
to prove this, namely, by foretelling future things, as God had often done for the good of his people: <hi>Let them bring forth, and ſhew as what ſhall happen.</hi> As for the next words, <hi>let them ſhew the former things what they be,</hi> &amp;c. There is much difference amongſt Expoſitors concerning the meaning and drift of them. Some think that by <hi>former things,</hi> is meant (as the words plainly ſeem to import) things paſt, and that the telling of this is required of their Idol-gods; becauſe, poor dead and dumb things, they were not able to do that. The whole period ſeems to intend as much, as if it had been ſaid, Let them, if they will be gods, prove themſelves Omniſcient, as the true God is; ſuch as know all things, both things paſt and things to come: of the firſt, things paſt, the words immediately following are meant, <hi>let them ſhew the former things;</hi> that is, Things that have formerly been done, <hi>that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them;</hi> that is, That we may improve the knowledg of theſe fore-paſt things by conſidering ſeriouſly of them, and of the event that followed thereupon: and then he repeats that of foretelling future things; <hi>or declare us things for to come,</hi> that being indeed incommunicably proper to God. Again others hold, that by <hi>former things,</hi> are meant the things which the Idol-gods had formerly foretold; <hi>let them ſhew the former things what they be,</hi> that is, Let them tell us what thoſe things are, which they have formerly foretold, <hi>that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them;</hi> that is, That we may duely weigh them, and that we may know whether they came to paſs exactly as they were foretold, and ſo may judge of the queſtion in hand, whether they be gods or no; or elſe let them at preſent tell us what things are to come to paſs hereafter. And laſtly, others by <hi>the former things,</hi> underſtand the firſt of future things, which I judge to be the true meaning of the words; <hi>Let them bring them forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen: let them ſhew the former things what they be;</hi> that is, The former of future events; thoſe things that are immediately to come to paſs, <hi>that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them;</hi> that is, That conſidering ſeriouſly of them, we may be able to judge what is like to be the end and event of ſuch things in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, that ſo we may accordingly prepare to avoid the evil, or fit ourſelves for the good, which we judge thoſe things are like to produce. It may be taken to be all one in effect, as if it had been ironically ſaid, Let the Idol-gods foretel thoſe things that are forthwith to come to paſs, and we will by diſcourſe and reaſon judge hereby of what is like to follow afterward; or elſe, let the Idol-gods foretel all things that are to be, the former and the later, from the beginning to the end. But may ſome ſay, How can the foretelling of future things be mentioned thus, as that whereby they were to prove themſelves gods, ſeeing it is evident, that the Idol-gods amongſt the Heathens, or rather the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by them, did often in their Oracles foretel future things? I anſwer, It is undoubtedly God alone that can foretel all future things infallibly of himſelf; and this the Idols nor the Devil in them never did, nor could do. Their predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were but either natural or politick Conjectures (which by reaſon of their great Knowledge they were the better able to make) and therefore their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were uſually ſo ambiguous, that whatever the event was, they might ſeem to have foretold the truth: or elſe they foretold them by ſome diſcovery
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42788:204"/>
they had made of thoſe things from the Scriptures, or from ſome command they had received from God concerning ſome thing they were to do. And all this likewiſe God ſuffered to be done, that they might, in a way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, be the more blinded and carried away by the deluſions of Satan.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> &amp;c.] See the foregoing Note. This is again ironically ſpoken; <hi>yea, do good, or do evil,</hi> that is, Reward them that faithfully ſerve you, and puniſh your enemies, as before I have ſhown that I have done for my people, the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham;</hi> which is alſo propounded as the ſole work of God, there being none but he that can abſolutely at his own pleaſure both ſave and deſtroy, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. <hi>that we may be diſmayed, and behold it together,</hi> that is, That we may be aſtoniſhed at the great things you will do (a ſharp taunt) and may joyntly obſerve and conſider of it, and ſo be convinced that ye are Gods.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.] Here God by the Prophet gives over reaſoning with the Idol-gods, and paſſeth ſentence againſt them; <hi>Behold, ye are of nothing,</hi> that is, So far ye are from being able to foretel, or do any thing good or evil, that indeed ye are nothing (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World</hi>) that is, As to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And much to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>and your work of nought,</hi> that is, your Workmanſhip, the ſhape or figure which men put upon you, is nothing worth, or hath nothing divine in it; <hi>or your work is of nought,</hi> that is, you can do nothing, neither good nor evil. But now the whole verſe may be read as it is in the Margin, <hi>Behold, ye are worſe than nothing,</hi> to wit, becauſe ſo much wickedneſs was committed in them; <hi>and your work worſe than of a viper,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, as having your original from the Devil; or you not only do no good, but indeed you do much miſchief to thoſe that worſhip you.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>I have raiſed up one from the North, and he ſhall come,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing verſes derided the Vanity of the Heathens Idol-gods, by challenging them to foretel future things, or to do good or evil (neither of which it was ſure they could do) here now by both thoſe evidences God doth again aſſert himſelf to be the only true God, namely, becauſe he had foretold, and doth here again foretel the great things he would do for his people in future times: <hi>I have raiſed up one from the North,</hi> that is, I have determined he ſhall be raiſed up, <hi>&amp;c. and he ſhall come; from the riſing of the Sun ſhall he call upon my name:</hi> it is a very difficult place, and therefore Expoſitors differ much in their Judgments concerning the perſon here intended. Firſt, ſome underſtand this <hi>one</hi> to be the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> their King, who are uſually ſaid in the Prophets to have come <hi>from the North</hi> (as we ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.13, 15. and ſo in many other places) and yet it might be withal ſaid, that <hi>from the riſing of the Sun,</hi> that is, from the Eaſt, he ſhould call upon Gods name, becauſe <hi>Chaldea,</hi> as ſome ſay, lay North-eaſt from <hi>Judea;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> did there acknowledg the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the moſt High God
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42788:205"/>
that ruleth and governeth the whole World, and ſpake very honourably of him; See <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.26, 28, 29. and 4.34, 37. and to his great Victories not only over <hi>Judea,</hi> but likewiſe over many other Nations, that in the laſt words may well be applied: <hi>and he ſhall come upon Princes, as upon mortar,</hi> &amp;c. that is, He ſhall ſubdue them and trample upon them as eaſily as Mortar is trodden under mens feet. Secondly, others underſtand the firſt clauſe, <hi>I have raiſed up one from the North, and he ſhall come</hi> (as is before ſaid) of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> that from the North were called againſt <hi>Judea;</hi> and the ſecond clauſe, <hi>from the riſing of the Sun ſhall he call upon my name;</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was raiſed up of God againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and whoſe people, ſay they, lay Eaſtward of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And thus they conceive that two great changes are here foretold, which none at this time could have imagined, to wit, 1. That God would raiſe up the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in the North, that ſhould become a mighty Empire, and ſhould be a ſore ſcourge to <hi>Judea,</hi> and carry away Gods people Captives into a ſtrange Country. And 2ly. that the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould afterwards from the Eaſt break in pieces the Empire of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and diſmiſs the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Captivity. And indeed againſt this Expoſition there can be nothing well objected, but that in our Tranſlation both clauſes ſeem apparently to ſpeak of one and the ſame perſon: <hi>I have raiſed up one from the North, and he ſhall come: from the riſing of the Sun ſhall he call upon my name.</hi> Thirdly, others therefore do rather underſtand both clauſes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who came againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> with an Army of <hi>Medes</hi> that lay more northerly from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> that lay more eaſterly to it, (and therefore is here ſaid to be raiſed up of God, <hi>from the North and from the riſing of the Sun</hi>) and trampled the Princes of that great Empire like mortar under his feet; and may well be ſaid to have called upon Gods name with reference to that Proclamation of his, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.2. when he gave liberty to the <hi>Jews</hi> to return into their own Country, wherein he did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the Lord Jehovah, the God of Heaven, to be the Author of all his Victories. But fourthly, others hold, and I think moſt probably, that God doth here again aſſert, as an evidence of that his Omniſcience and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, which could not be found in the Idol-gods, that which he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. concerning his calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him his Poſterity, out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> (which lying North-eaſt of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> it is therefore ſaid, that God raiſed him <hi>from the North, and from the riſing of the Sun</hi>) and making them victorious over ſo many Nations. And thus under this ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even Chriſt alſo may be comprehended, who ſhould ſubdue all his peoples ſpiritual enemies, Sin, Death, and the Devil, the Prince of the World; and by the preaching of the Goſpel bring all Nations to the obedience of the Faith; or rather, the Church of Chriſt, the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſhould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from all quarters of the World (for though the North and Eaſt are only mentioned, as in like manner <hi>the Eaſt and the Weſt,</hi> Matth. 8.11. under theſe all other parts are compriſed, as we find it more fully afterwards expreſſed, Chap. 43.5, 6. <hi>I will bring thy ſeed from the Eaſt, and gather thee from the Weſt; I will ſay to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not back</hi>) and ſhould ſerve God and call upon his name, and ſo by his aid and aſſiſtance ſhould ſubdue all their enemies, and tread them under their feet.</p>

                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:42788:205"/>Ver. 26. <hi>Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Who of all your Idol-gods hath from their firſt beginning, or long before (as it is in the following branch) foretold things to come, as I have done in thoſe things that I have foretold concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed? (See the foregoing Note) or particularly concerning their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon; that we may know,</hi> to wit, which of them it is that hath ſo done, or what the things are which he did ſo foretel, and whether they came to paſs according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo whether he be indeed a God, as he is pretended to be? <hi>and before time, that we may ſay, He is righteous?</hi> that is, who of your Idol-gods have before time made known ſuch future things, that we may acknowledg that he hath rightly foretold them, and that he is to be juſtified and allowed of in his claim to a Godhead? And this indeed agreeth with that expreſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children,</hi> Mat. 11.14. <hi>yea there is none that ſheweth,</hi> that is, There is never an one of their Idols that ever did, or indeed can foretel what ſhall be hereafter; <hi>yea, there is none that declareth,</hi> that is, There is neither Prieſt nor Prophet, that being inſpired by theſe their Gods, either do, or can declare from them what ſhall come to paſs in future times; <hi>yea, there is none that heareth your words,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ye are all dumb Gods; and therefore there is no hearing of any ſuch thing from you, or from any body to whom you have imparted it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>The firſt ſhall ſay to Zion,</hi> &amp;c.] God, as I conceive, doth here ſpeak of himſelf in a third perſon. But it is all one in effect as if he had ſaid, I the Lord, who am abſolutely <hi>the firſt,</hi> not having any dependance upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) or that did firſt undertake to prove my ſelf the only true and living God, by foretelling things to come, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards challenged the Heathens Idol-gods, if they could, to do the like (See the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. and <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22.) I <hi>the firſt, ſhall ſay to Zion, Behold, behold them:</hi> that is, ſay ſome, I will before-hand make known to my people, firſt the coming of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> upon them to puniſh them for their ſins, and after the coming of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of their Captivity; or, I will ſay to <hi>Zion,</hi> Behold my Servants the Prophets, who ſhall foretel future things to you, or that ſhall bring you ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the accompliſhment of thoſe things that I had foretold you: or rather, I will ſay to <hi>Zion</hi> for her comfort, <hi>Behold, Behold them,</hi> that is, Behold my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom you thought utterly loſt, are now brought back from their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſo poor <hi>Zion</hi> that lay deſolate before like a very wilderneſs, ſhall then ſee her Children come flocking in to her in great abundance: <hi>and I will give to Jeruſalem one that bringeth good tidings,</hi> that is, Such as ſhall bring them good tidings, to wit, both concerning their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that likewiſe which was ſignified thereby, the glad tidings of the Goſpel; See the Note, Chap. 40.9. This is that which I conceive may moſt probably be intended in this verſe. But yet I know there are divers learned Expoſitors that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtand theſe words. As the firſt branch, <hi>the firſt ſhall ſay to Zion, Behold, behold them:</hi> ſome underſtand of the firſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhould come home from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to wit, That they ſhould with great joy make known the approach of Gods people, Behold, here our Brethren come in great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.

And again, ſome underſtand it of Chriſt, the chief and head of the Church; yea, the only Prophet of his Church, from whom all the Prophets that were at any time inſpired, did receive their Prophecies; to wit, That he ſhould make known the accompliſhment of thoſe things that had been foretold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the days of the Goſpel. Yea, and ſome underſtand it particularly of the Baptiſt, who was the <hi>firſt</hi> that proclaimed the coming of the promiſed <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi> And ſo for the laſt clauſe, <hi>and I will give to Jeruſalem one that bringeth good tidings,</hi> they underſtand it ſolely of thoſe that ſhould be ſent to preach the glad tidings of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>For I beheld, and there was no man,</hi> &amp;c.] God having challenged the Heathens Idol-gods to appear, as it were, in open Judgment, that upon a debate betwixt him and them, it might be determined whether they were true Gods or no; upon default of appearance, as I may ſay, he takes the Cauſe <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and as a Judge, pronounceth Sentence againſt them, that they were no gods, but meer Counterfeits; <hi>For I beheld, and there was no man;</hi> that is, I looked about to ſee whether any did appear, or whether any of theſe Idol-gods, or their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, would undertake to prove them to be gods, and found there was none; <hi>even amongſt them,</hi> that is, amongſt the Idolaters and their Idol-gods; <hi>and there was no Counſellor, that when I asked of them, could anſwer a word;</hi> that is, There was none that would undertake to plead their Cauſe, and that could anſwer me a word, when I had challenged them to ſay what they could; Or, there was none that did ſo much as go about to conſult together what anſwer they ſhould give; which indeed agreeth with a like paſſage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.21. <hi>Tell ye, and bring them near, yea, let them take counſel together.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>BEhold my ſervant,</hi> &amp;c.] Some learned Expoſitors are of opinion, that this Prophecy might be intended concerning <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as he was a type of Chriſt; and that becauſe there are ſeveral paſſages in this Chapter, that are the ſame in effect with others in the 44, and 45. Chapters, where <hi>Cyrus</hi> is expreſly named; and whereas it may be objected, that ſome paſſages here cannot with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be underſtood of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> to this they anſwer, That in other like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42788:206"/>
where both Chriſt, and likewiſe <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as types of Chriſt, are joyntly intended, there are ſome paſſages that cannot properly be applied to the types, but only to Chriſt, who was chiefly intended; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. and 16.8. and 22.1. and 45.1. and 72.1. But though it may be queſtioned whether it were meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom God made uſe of as his Servant in that great work; there can be no queſtion made, but that it was principally intended concerning Chriſt; becauſe St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us that what the Prophet ſaith here in the firſt four verſes, was fulfilled in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.17, 18. &amp;c. It is uſual with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when they foretel things hard to be believed, therewith to joyn ſome Prophecy concerning Chriſt; the reaſon whereof ſee in the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. But here a more particular reaſon may be given of that which is here prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of Chriſt. God having in the foregoing Chapter proved himſelf to be the only true God, by that whereby the Idol-gods, as he there tells them, could not prove their Deities; namely, by foretelling future things, which he would do for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not only in their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but alſo in that greater work of their Redemption by Chriſt, whereof that was a type; and how Chriſt and thoſe whom he ſhould ſend forth, ſhould bring them the glad tidings of the accompliſhment of the great mercies here foretold (See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.25, 27.) Here he proceeds on in theſe his Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt, <hi>Behold my ſervant,</hi> to wit, Chriſt; who though he were the only begotten Son of God, yet is here called Gods <hi>Servant,</hi> with reſpect to his humane nature, wherein <hi>he took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2.7. and as man, was bound to ſerve God in a thorough obedience to his Laws; but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that ſingular Office of the Mediator, which God had impoſed upon him; <hi>whom I uphold,</hi> to wit, That he may not ſink under my wrath which he is to bear for ſinners; nor under any other difficulty or diſcouragement which he ſhall meet with in the diſcharge of his Office, but may thoroughly fulfil it; <hi>mine elect,</hi> that is, whom from eternity I elected to this ſervice, and who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, both in regard of the tranſcendent dignity of his Office, and the dearneſs of his perſon, and his exact diſcharge of his Office, my choice Servant, <hi>in whom my ſoul delighteth;</hi> that is, whom I dearly love, and through whom, and for whoſe ſake only I am well pleaſed with others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I have put my ſpirit upon him,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles,</hi> that is, He ſhall cauſe his Goſpel to be publiſhed, not to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but alſo to the Gentiles, and thereby ſet up his Kingdom amongſt them, and rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them as his peculiar people; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreets.]</hi> It is expreſly noted of Chriſt, that ſometimes in his preaching he lifted up his voice and ſpake very loud; as <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> The meaning therefore of that which is here prophecied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, is rather, 1. That this great King of the Church ſhould make no great noiſe in the World, that he ſhould come to his people in an humble and low Condition, without any of that ſtir or noiſe that uſeth to be where earthly Kings and Potentates come in Pomp and State to any place. Or 2ly. That he
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42788:207"/>
ſhould be moſt humble, and meek, and gentle, not ſeeking the applauſe of men in a boaſting way, not ſeeking to awe and keep under his people by loud clamours and threatnings, as earthly Kings often uſe to do, nor endeavouring to carry on his Cauſe in a paſſionate and clamorous way, as men are wont to do, that not being able to convince men by ſtrength of Argnment, do then aſſay to overbear men by paſſionate and loud ſpeaking; whence it is that the Apoſtle joyns <hi>wrath, and anger, and clamour,</hi> together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31. And this Expoſition may ſeem indeed the more probable, becauſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.19. this place is cited thus, <hi>He ſhall not ſtrive nor cry,</hi> &amp;c. and it is purpoſely cited by the Evangeliſt in that place, to ſhew how fully that was accompliſhed in Chriſt, which our Prophet had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning the Humility, Meekneſs, and Calmneſs of Spirit that ſhould be in the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> for having related how the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were enraged againſt him for a Miracle that he had wrought, and how Chriſt thereupon did not ſo much as contend with them, but only withdrew himſelf from thence to another place, that he might not, when they were in ſuch a rage, provoke them any further, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. and charged the people not to make known the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that preſently after he wrought in another place, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he adds <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the Prophet, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Behold my Servant whom I have choſen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall not ſtrive nor cry, neither ſhall any man hear his voice in the ſtreets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thoſe that are as a cracked and bruiſed Cane or Reed which men are wont to break in pieces and throw away as good for nothing; <hi>and the ſmoking</hi> (or <hi>dimly burning) flax ſhall he not quench;</hi> that is, Thoſe that are as the wick of a Candle that burns dimly, or as a ſnuff that hath more ſmoke than light, and is even ready to go out, which men are wont to caſt away, or at leaſt to put them quite out. They that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of <hi>Cyrus</hi> as a type of Chriſt, do apply it thus, That he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and deſtroy the people of God, whom he found in <hi>Babylon</hi> in a low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, under extream Bondage and Slavery; but on the contrary was very tender over them, and reſcued them out of the hands of their Oppreſſors, and ſent them home with honour into their own Country. But it is queſtionleſs meant of Chriſt. And though it may be extended to his patience, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forbearance towards the worſt, as appears by the Evangeliſts citing this place, with reſpect to Chriſts yielding-carrage towards the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (See the foregoing Note) yet I conceive it is chiefly meant of Chriſts Gentleneſs and Clemency towards the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, and thoſe that are ſorely troubled and wounded in Conſcience for ſin. 1. He will not drive thoſe to deſpair by dealing over-rigorouſly and roughly with them that are poor brooken-hearted ſinners, and that are through the Affrightments of Sin and Satan, and the weakneſs of their Faith, ready to ſink in deſpair, like a wick of a Candle that is even ready to go out, but will rather cheriſh and encourage them, and blow up that ſpark of Faith that is in them. And 2ly. he will not caſt off thoſe that have but a weak meaſure of Grace, Piety and Goodneſs, that are like ſmoking flax, in that the light of Grace is hardly diſcernable by reaſon of thoſe ſtrong corruptions wherewith it is in a manner overwhelmed, but will bear with them, and cheriſh them, till Grace grow ſtronger in them. As for the laſt clauſe,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42788:207"/>
                  <hi>he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto truth;</hi> it is much the ſame with that, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles;</hi> and the meaning therefore ſeems to be, That by the preaching of the Goſpel, he ſhould ſet up his Kingdom among his people faithfully, according to what he had promiſed; or that he ſhould judge and govern his people truly, according to the rule of the Goſpel. And thus this may be added by way of explaining the former words, namely, by ſhewing, that though Chriſt ſhould deal very gently with the weakeſt of true Believers and true Penitents, yet he would not cheriſh any in their ſins, nor ſhew any favour to Hypocrites, and profane obſtinate Deſpiſers of the grace that was tendered them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He ſhall not faint nor be diſheartned from going on in his work by any hard labor or grievous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; yea, though all the World oppoſe him, he ſhall courageouſly go on; <hi>till he have ſet Judgment in the earth,</hi> that is, Till by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he hath ſetled a Church upon earth, and therein hath eſtabliſhed his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, even that Government whereby he ſets up his Throne in the hearts of his people, and works a thorough Reformation in them, bringing the whole man to the obedience of his will, and whereby he ſubdueth all contrary powers which reſiſt and oppoſe the exerciſe of his Kingly power, for the good of his Church and people; and with reſpect unto this laſt I conceive it is, that theſe words of the Prophet are rendred by the Evangeliſt, <hi>till he ſend forth judgment unto victory,</hi> Matth. 12.20. <hi>and the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> that is, even the Gentiles in the remoteſt parts of the earth ſhall with all greedineſs embrace his Goſpel, the Law whereby he will judge and govern his people.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] By God the Fathers calling Chriſt (the like whereto is alſo ſaid of <hi>Cyrus</hi> as a type of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.4. <hi>I have called thee by thy name</hi>) may be meant, either his fore-appointing him to the Office of the Mediator (See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) or his actual bringing him to the undertaking of this Office by his Incarnation, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration thereto whilſt he was upon earth; according to the like Expreſſions we find elſewhere of Gods calling for a Famine, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.1. and of his <hi>calling the Generations from the beginning,</hi> Chap. 41.4. And if we take it thus, we muſt know, that this is ſpoken of as done already, <hi>I have called thee,</hi> only to imply the certainty of it. As for thoſe words <hi>(in righteouſneſs) I have called thee in righteouſneſs,</hi> the meaning thereof is, either 1. That Chriſt was deſigned to this Office in a juſt and righteous way, namely, by commiſſion from God, whoſe will is the ſure rule of righteouſneſs, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. that he took not this Honour to himſelf; and that too not without his own free conſent, See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. Or, 2ly. That God called him in faithfulneſs that he might perform the Promiſes which he had made unto his people; <hi>and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee,</hi> that is, I will direct, ſupport and defend thee: See the Notes, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. and 73.23. <hi>and give thee
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42788:208"/>
for a Covenant of the people,</hi> that is, to be the Mediator, <hi>the Meſſenger,</hi> Mal. 3.1. the Surety and the Ratifier of that Covenant of Grace which God hath made with his people; <hi>i.e.</hi> with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who are primarily here intended, and therefore diſtinguiſhed here from the Gentiles) and then alſo with all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers taken into the ſame Church with them; <hi>for a light of the Gentiles,</hi> that is, to enlighten their minds, and chear up their hearts; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>To open the blind eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, To enlighten mens minds, that were by nature ſpiritually blind; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.5. <hi>to bring out the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from the priſon; and them that ſit in darkneſs, out of the Priſon-houſe;</hi> that is, To reſcue poor ſinners out of the Bondage of Satan, Sin and Death; and ſo out of that blindneſs and woful miſery wherein they lay, which may well be called the darkneſs of the Devils Dungeon; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the Hebrew, <hi>I am Jehovah,</hi> which imports a God that hath his being of himſelf, and from whom all things have their being; <hi>that is my name,</hi> that is, that peculiar name whereby I have made my ſelf known to my people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whereby I will be diſtinguiſhed from all Idols and falſe gods that have their being from others; See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. and 6.3. <hi>and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to graven Images;</hi> that is, The Glory and Praiſe of being the only true God, or the Glory of an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing what I have foretold ſhould be, which is that whereby God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertaken to prove himſelf the only true God; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41. 22, 23, 25, &amp;c. It ſeems therefore that the Lord having finiſhed the foregoing Prophecy concerning Chriſt, doth here again hereupon aſſert, That he, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe name was Jehovah, that had foretold theſe things, was the only true God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Behold, the former things are come to paſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The ſeveral things which from time to time I have long before-hand foretold my people, have been all accompliſhed in their ſeveral ſeaſons; <hi>and new things do I declare,</hi> to wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the return of Gods people into their own land, and their greater deliverance by Chriſt; <hi>before they ſpring forth, I tell you of them,</hi> that is, long before there is any appearance or any probable ſign of any ſuch thing. It is as if he had ſaid: As ſure as the former things have been accompliſhed, ſo ſurely ſhall theſe things alſo, which I now foretel, come to paſs. And thus the Lord doth re-aſſume his former Argument of proving himſelf to be the only true God, by his foretelling future things: See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.22, 27.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new Song,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſong; or rather, a new Song, to ſet forth a new work of wonder which God would work; for indeed this is ſaid with reference to that, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>and new things do I declare.</hi> But ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.3. <hi>and his praiſe from the end of the earth;</hi> ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.16. <hi>ye that go down to the Sea,</hi> to wit, Mariners and Merchants; ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.23. <hi>and all that is therein,</hi> that is, that dwell in the Iſlands that are in the Sea, as it is explained in the following words, <hi>the Iſles, and the Inhabitants thereof.</hi> The Prophet having foretold the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Deliverance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which is the chiefeſt of all,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42788:208"/>
the great work of mans Redemption by Chriſt; he now ſtirs up the Nations that ſhould hear of theſe things, to ſing forth Gods praiſe; and that purpoſely to imply the certainty of theſe things, the better to chear up thoſe whoſe deliverance was therein concerned. And indeed, as it was ſpoken with reſpect to Chriſt, concerning whom the Prophet had immediately before prophecied, it implies a clear prediction how all Nations ſhould praiſe God upon the preaching of the Goſpel amongſt the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Let the wilderneſs and the Cities thereof lift up their voice,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1. And if by <hi>the Wilderneſs</hi> here, be meant that vaſt deſart that lay Eaſt-ward of <hi>Judea,</hi> as the Sea, mentioned in the foregoing verſe, lay on the Weſt; then this is all one in effect, as if it had been ſaid, That from the riſing unto the ſetting of the Sun, God ſhould be praiſed: <hi>the villages that Kedar doth inhabit,</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. <hi>let the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the rock ſing,</hi> that is, The Inhabitants of <hi>Arabia Petrea,</hi> or of <hi>Petra</hi> the chief City in thoſe parts; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.1. or rather, thoſe that inhabit mountainous Countries, as the following words ſhew, <hi>let them ſhout from the top of the mountains.</hi> However, as this is ſpoken with reſpect to the days of the Goſpel, it clearly implies, That the moſt barbarous Nations ſhould then praiſe God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Lord ſhall go forth as a mighty man,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, having long withdrawn himſelf, as if he minded them not, he ſhall at laſt go forth in great fury, to wit, againſt the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 16.14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.65. <hi>He ſhall ſtir up jealouſie like a man of war,</hi> that is, As men ſtir and blow up a fire, ſo ſhall the Lord ſtir up the fire of <hi>his jealouſie,</hi> to wit, his fierce wrath and indignation againſt his idolatrous enemies, proceeding from his ardent love to his people, and zeal for his own glory; <hi>he ſhall cry,</hi> to wit, as ſoldiers are wont to ſhout when they aſſault their enemies; <hi>yea, roar,</hi> to wit like a Lyon. But now this may be ſpoken with reference to Chriſt, that he ſhould go forth as a mighty man (it is an Expreſſion which our Saviour himſelf uſed, <hi>John</hi> 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world</hi>) namely, to vanquiſh all his peoples ſpiritual enemies, Satan, Sin, Death and Hell, and to deſtroy all thoſe that obſtinately oppoſe him, and are the implacable enemies of his Church and people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>I have long time holden my peace,</hi> &amp;c.] God himſelf is here brought in complaining of his enemies abuſing his long-ſuffering and patience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Deliverance to his people: <hi>I have long time holden my peace, I have been ſtill and refrained my ſelf,</hi> to wit, (as the following ſimilitude ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) as a travelling Woman bites in her pains, and forbears crying out as long as ever ſhe is able; and the meaning is, That he had long forborn taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on his peoples enemies, and ſuffered his people to be ſtill kept in Bondage by them: <hi>now will I cry like a travelling Woman,</hi> that is, as ſuch a Woman, when ſhe comes to the extremity of her pain, the Child being brought to the very birth, is then forced to cry aloud, and many times breathes out her cries the louder, becauſe ſhe had before ſuppreſſed them, and kept them in, thereby ſtriving to help forward her deliverance, till when ſhe can expect no eaſe nor reſt; ſo will I with all earneſtneſs haſten the Deliverance of my people, as if I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and were in pain until they were delivered, and will fall with the greater
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42788:209"/>
fury upon their enemies becauſe of my former forbearance. And indeed this ſimilitude doth notably ſet forth, 1. Gods tender affection to his people, even like that of a Mother to the Child in her Womb. 2ly. His earneſt deſire of their deliverance. And 3ly. that though the Lord had hitherto only groaned in a more ſilent manner for their ſad Condition, yet now the ſet and appointed time being come, they ſhould ſpeedily be delivered, as the Child is when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cries are loudeſt. As for thoſe laſt words, <hi>I will deſtroy and devour at once,</hi> either the meaning is, That the Lord would <hi>deſtroy</hi> their Enemies Land, and <hi>devour</hi> the Inhabitants; or that he would ſpeedily make an end of them all together, as it is with hungry ravenous wild beaſts, that as ſoon as they have killed their prey, do immediately devour it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>I will make waſte mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the herbage which the Mountains and all other parts of the Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded both for man and beaſt; <hi>and I will make the rivers Iſlands,</hi> that is, Dry them up ſo, that here and there the dry land ſhall appear like ſo many Iſlands. The drift of the whole verſe is to ſet forth the horrid Deſolation that God would make in the land of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> when he undertook the Deliverance of his people from thence. And to this end he ſpeaks of his Vengeance therein, as a devouring Fire that would burn up all before it; See the Notes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. and 32.22. And the particular mention that is made of laying waſte their <hi>Mountains and Hills,</hi> is either becauſe there uſually they had their idolatrous Temples and Altars; or rather, becauſe there they had their greateſt Cities and places of ſtrength. And the ſame may be ſaid for the mentioning of the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of their <hi>Rivers,</hi> which were the great ſafeguard of their Country; all is to imply, that all the ſtrength and Riches of their Country ſhould not hinder God from deſtroying them, and delivering his people out of their hands: one particular whereof is noted by ſome Expoſitors to have been accompliſhed when <hi>Cyrus</hi> made the great River <hi>Euphrates</hi> paſſable for his Army when they took <hi>Babylon.</hi> And then as this Prophecy refers to Chriſt, the ſame is meant that is ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. That he ſhould deſtroy the Kingdom of Satan, and all the great enemies of his people, and ruine all the Riches, and Pomp, and State of thoſe that ſhould exalt themſelves againſt him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not,</hi> &amp;c.] As this is meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they are termed <hi>blind,</hi> becauſe they ſaw nothing of their approaching Deliverance; they ſaw no likelihood of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of that ſad Condition wherein they lay, and ſo regarded not Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but as men ſtupified and hopeleſs, were in continual perplexity, not knowing which way to turn themſelves; and of their return into <hi>Judea,</hi> it might well be ſaid, That they were led <hi>by a way they knew not, and in paths they had not known;</hi> becauſe the generality of them were born in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and ſo had never gone that way before. But as it is meant of Chriſts redeemed ones, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was accompliſhed in the enlightning of their blind minds (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.5.) and bringing them into the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof they knew nothing before. And the like may be ſaid of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words; they may be meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> returning out of <hi>Babylon; I will make darkneſs light before them,</hi> that is, I will bring them out of an afflicted
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42788:209"/>
and ſad Eſtate, into a joyful and proſperous Condition (See the Notes, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.16. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4.) or rather, I will make their way clear before them, wherein otherwiſe they might have been often brought to a ſtand, not knowing which way to turn themſelves; <hi>and crooked things ſtraight,</hi> that is, their way ſhall be eaſie and plain, free from thoſe troubles and difficulties which otherwiſe they might have found in it. But under this type is ſurely alſo meant, That Chriſt would enlighten and chear up his Servants by his word and ſpirit, and turn them from their crooked wicked ways into the ſtraight ways of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. <hi>Theſe things will I do,</hi> to wit, how impoſſible ſoever men may deem them, <hi>and not forſake them;</hi> that is, though becauſe of their long Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> I may ſeem to have quite caſt them off, yet I will not forſake them, nor leave them always in bondage; or having delivered them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I will not then leave them till I have brought them ſafe home to their own Country. And of Chriſt likewiſe this is moſt true, becauſe he never forſakes his, but whom he loves, he loves unto the end, <hi>John</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>They ſhall be turned back, they ſhall be greatly aſhamed that truſt in graven Images,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken of the idolatrous <hi>Babylonians,</hi> to wit, that they ſhould not be able to ſtand before Gods avenging hand, but ſhould fly with ſhame before their enemies; Or, that they ſhould <hi>be turned back,</hi> as men that are aſhamed to ſhew their faces, when they ſhould ſee how they were diſappointed of their hopes, how unable their Idol-gods were to ſave them, or to do that for them, which the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done for his people. But ſee the Notes, Chap. 1.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.4. and 40.14. and 97.7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Hear ye deaf, and look ye blind, that ye may ſee.]</hi> Some few Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors would have it, that the Heathens are here willed to yield and be convinced by the great things which they ſhould ſee done by the Lord for his poor people, of which mention was made in the foregoing verſes. But by the whole ſequel of the Chapter it ſeems clear, that the Prophet doth here addreſs himſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and either it is meant of the ſpiritual Blindneſs and Stupidity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in that Age, that both then when the Prophet now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied to them, and ſo afterward from time to time, were deaf to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Warnings of Gods Prophets, and blind as to a ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the great works that God had wrought amongſt them, and ſo ran on impenitently, till the Lord was forced to bring a barbarous Nation upon them that ſhould carry them Captives into <hi>Babylon:</hi> Or elſe it may be meant principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the days of the Goſpel, this being a matter of greateſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came into the World (as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the beginning of this Chapter) the Gentiles ſhould ſee and embrace the Salvation tendered in him by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gods peculiar people, to whom he had been ſo long promiſed, ſhould continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately blind, and deſpiſe that great Salvation that was offered to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Who is blind, but my Servant?</hi> &amp;c.] They that underſtand the foregoing verſe as ſpoken to the heathen Nations, do accordingly hold, that this is added by way of Correction, as if it had been ſaid, Why do I check the Gentiles for their blindneſs? none are in truth blinder than mine own people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But rather this is added to confirm what was ſaid before concerning the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:42788:210"/>
blindneſs. <hi>Who is blind, but my ſervant?</hi> to wit, mine own people the <hi>Jews; or deaf, as my meſſenger that I ſent?</hi> that is, My Prieſts and Levites whom I have ſet apart for the inſtructing of others; according to that of the Prophet, <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledg, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth: for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 2.7. <hi>Who is blind as he that is perfect?</hi> &amp;c. that is, Thoſe that ought to have been perfect in the Knowledg of Gods will, or that think and boaſt themſelves to be perfect above others. And this may be meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general, who had indeed greater means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg than other Nations, and gloried much therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 20. <hi>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will—and art confident that thou thy ſelf art a guide of the blind,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe of their Teachers, who indeed had means of being eminently kowing men above others, and were herein highly conceited of themſelves, as we may ſee by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> taking ſo great offence at our Saviours charging them with blindneſs, <hi>John</hi> 9.40. <hi>Are we</hi> (ſay they) <hi>blind alſo.</hi> The ſum of that which is here ſaid, is this, That even theſe men were blinder and more ſtupid than the very Heathens, becauſe under ſo much light and means of Knowledg, they became never a whit the wiſer for their own good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Seeing many things,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, to ſhew what blindneſs and deafneſs it was, that in the foregoing Verſes the <hi>Jews</hi> were charged with, to wit, ſpiritual blindneſs and deafneſs, <hi>ſeeing many things, but thou obſerveſt not; opening the ears, but he heareth not:</hi> that is, They minded not the great works that God wrought amongſt them, nor what God ſpake to them by his Prophets, no more than if they had been indeed blind and deaf; See the Notes, Chap. 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>The Lord is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> &amp;c.] This is a very hard paſſage, and therefore Expoſitors differ much concerning the meaning of it. But becauſe it is not otherwiſe expreſſed what it was that God was <hi>well pleaſed</hi> with, I conceive it moſt probable, that this is ſpoken with reference to the following clauſe, <hi>he will magnifie the Law, and make it</hi> (or <hi>him) honourable:</hi> as if it had been all jointly together expreſſed thus: That <hi>the Lord for his righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> that is, purpoſely to approve himſelf righteous in all his dealings with his people, was <hi>well pleaſed to magnifie his law</hi> amongſt them, <hi>and make it honourable.</hi> But how was God <hi>well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake</hi> to <hi>magnifie his Law, and make it honourable?</hi> I anſwer, 1. Some underſtand it thus, That God was willing and well pleaſed to do his people good, and to have upheld them in a proſperous and flouriſhing Condition, that hereby he might manifnſt his Righteouſneſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good his promiſes, and they might be brought highly to eſteem and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Law, finding how well it fared with them becauſe of their careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of it; and hence it is that ſome read the laſt words thus, <hi>to magnifie his Law; and make him,</hi> that is, his people <hi>honourable.</hi> And thus, ſay they, the Prophet implies, That God being ſo ready to do them good, if they came to be in any great miſery, they muſt aſcribe it to their own obſtinacy, and ſtupidity, and rebellion againſt God. Again, 2ly. others underſtand it thus, that God was pleaſed to give them over in his wrath to that Blindneſs, and Deafneſs, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity mentioned in the foregoing Verſes, that ſo he might manifeſt his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42788:210"/>
in bringing thoſe Judgments upon them, wherewith he had threatned them in his Law, and ſo might bring them the more to reverence and magnifie his Law for the time to come. And this indeed ſeems to have the faireſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon that which went before. Nor do I ſee but that what is ſaid in theſe two foregoing Expoſitions might be joyntly intended, namely, That God was well pleaſed for his Righteouſneſs ſake, <hi>to magnifie his Law, and make it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> both by making good the promiſes thereof to his people, when they were carefully to obey it, and by puniſhing them as he had threatned, when they did ſlight and diſregard it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>But this is a people robbed and ſpoiled,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, This is a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will certainly be robbed and ſpoiled; for though ſome think that this is ſpoken of the ten Tribes, that were already vanquiſhed and carryed into Captivity by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> yet it ſeems rather to be meant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom the Prophet now ſpake, to wit, That they would be unqueſtionably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to be <hi>robbed and ſpoiled,</hi> namely, by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the <hi>Romans.</hi> It is, as if he had ſaid, God was willing to have done them good, but they would not obey him, nor mind the warnings given them, and ſo did in a manner chuſe rather to be robbed and ſpoiled; <hi>they are all of them ſnared in holes,</hi> that is, either being taken by their enemies, they ſhall be clapped up in caves and holes, till at more leiſure they may otherwiſe diſpoſe of them; or, though they fly into Caves and Dens of the earth, hoping there to hide or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves, yet being there cooped up, they will be only the more eaſily taken. This, indeed, may be read as it is in the Margin, <hi>inſnaring all the young men of them;</hi> the meaning whereof can be no other, but that this people by their infidelity and obſtinacy, brought their choice young men into Bondage and Captivity. But the former Tranſlation is more generally received; <hi>and they are hid in priſon-houſes, they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a ſpoil, and none ſaith, Reſtore,</hi> that is, none ſhall undertake to defend or deliver them; which though it was fulfilled in the <hi>Babylonians</hi> vanquiſhing of them, when none appeared conſiderably for their defence (as it had been alſo before with the ten Tribes, when they were captived by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and were never brought back again; of which ſome underſtand this place) yet it was moſt fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, when they were deſtroyed and diſperſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> under which ſad Condition they continue unto this day.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Who among you will give ear to this?</hi> &amp;c.] Thus the Prophet proves thoſe to be blind, and deaf, and ſtupid, whom before, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. he had called Gods Servants, and Gods Meſſengers, namely, becauſe they would not regard the warning he had now given them, <hi>who will hearken and hear for the time to come?</hi> of which the meaning is either, 1. That even in time to come, when the Judgments now threatned ſhould come upon them, they would not call to mind, or lay to heart the warning now given them. Or, 2ly. That there was very few of them that would ſo far regard what he had ſaid, as by timely Repentance and Reformation to prevent thoſe Judgments which he had told them would otherwiſe certainly in time to come be poured forth upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:42788:211"/>Ver. 24. <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have ſinned?</hi> &amp;c.] Some think that this is meant of the Deſtruction which God had brought upon the ten Tribes, commonly called the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their ſins; and ſo <hi>Judah</hi> is here warned by their Example. And others underſtand it of the ſpoil that had been formerly made in the land of <hi>Judah</hi> at ſeveral times by ſeveral Nations. But rather I conceive this is ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as ſuppoſed to be in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in <hi>Babylon:</hi> the aim of the Prophet being to convince them of this, as one of the great truths which they would not ſee, to wit, that it was the Lord their God that brought thoſe barbarous enemies upon them, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> firſt, and the <hi>Romans</hi> afterward, to puniſh them for their ſins. And if that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> be intended, then their diſobeying the Goſpel may be included in that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which is given of their Deſtruction; <hi>for they would not walk in his ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they obedient to his Law.</hi>

Rather it is meant of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> Invaſion, or that grievous War which the <hi>Romans</hi> made againſt them in after-times, which proved Deſtruction to the whole Nation: <hi>and it hath ſet him on fire round about,</hi> that is, It hath brought utter Deſtruction upon him, out of which there was no eſcaping; or their City and Country was on a light flame round about: for to the burning of the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I conceive theſe words have ſpecial reſpect; <hi>yet he knew it not,</hi> that is, He minded it not; <hi>and it burned him, yet he layed it not to heart;</hi> to wit, ſo as to repent of his ſins, and turn to the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>BUt now,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the latter end of the foregoing Chapter foretold a day of grievous miſery that was coming upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> wherein the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them ſhould continue obſtinate and impenitnent, notwithſtanding the wrath of God ſo terribly poured forth upon them; here the Lord by the Prophet returns to his former Conſolation, namely, That he would not utterly caſt off and deſtroy his people, but that there ſhould be a remnant whom he would preſerve, and with whom he would deal graciouſly, as with his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar inheritance; <hi>But now thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Iſrael;</hi> that is, who as I gave thee thy firſt being, together with the reſt of mankind, ſo I alſo formed thee, and moulded thee into a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church and State, and made thee a holy people for my ſelf; for that this is indeed chiefly intended, is evident by many places; See the Notes, Chap. 29.23.

And indeed, that this is principally here intended, appears by the following words; <hi>thou art mine:</hi> for which ſee the Notes, Chap. 41.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorough the waters, I will be with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to preſerve thee from drowning: <hi>when thou walkeſt thorough the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt,</hi> &amp;c. It is an Expreſſion much like that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>Thou haſt cauſed men to ride over our heads; we went thorough fire and thorough water:</hi> and it may be it was uſed in alluſion to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being carried ſafely thorough the Red Sea, and thorough <hi>Jordan.</hi> But however the meaning is, That God would deliver them out of their moſt deſperate Dangers and Miſeries, which muſt be underſtood as all other temporal promiſes, conditionally, to wit, unleſs God ſees it better for them by their conſtant ſufferings to confirm his truth, and ſo to tranſlate them to heavenly Glory.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I gave Egypt for thy ranſom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.]</hi> Moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors underſtand this thus; That when God raiſed up <hi>Tirhakah</hi> King of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> (of which ſee Chap. 37.9. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.9.) to go out with an Army againſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi> (wherein it may be probably thought both the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> went along with him as his Confederates) at that time when <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> was going up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not doubting ſpeedily to ſurprize and ſack that City; and <hi>Sennacherib</hi> upon the Report of the approach of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Army, was forced for the time to give over his deſign againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to march away againſt <hi>Tirhakah,</hi> whom with his whole Army he did at that time over-run and utterly deſtroy (for which ſee the Notes, Chap. 18.1. and 20.1.—4.) it might be well ſaid upon this account, That God gave the <hi>Egyptians, Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> as a ranſom for the <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe God did hereby give up, as it were, theſe Nations to be deſtroyed by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> purpoſely that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might thereby be delivered from that ruine which at that time hung over their heads. But many things aſſerted in this Expoſition are very queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And therefore I rather think, that the intention of theſe words was only to ſhew, That God had uſually deſtroyed other Nations, that he might deliver them; and that he inſtanceth in the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with reſpect to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were delivered from that hard bondage under which they had held them; and in the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> with reſpect to that mighty ſlaughter that was made amongſt them (with whom alſo it is likely the <hi>Sabeans</hi> were joyned) when they invaded <hi>Judea</hi> in the days of <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.9. &amp;c. In both which that was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.8. <hi>The Righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his ſtead.</hi> And Chap. 21.18. <hi>The wicked ſhall be a ranſom for the righteous;</hi> for which ſee the Notes in both places.</p>

                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:42788:212"/>Ver. 4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Since I took thee to be my peculiar people, <hi>thou haſt been honourable,</hi> to wit, as being advanced to ſuch an honourable Condition: Or, through my favour thou haſt become great, and of great renown above other Nations: <hi>and I have loved thee;</hi> that is, I have conſtantly continued to love thee, and to manifeſt it by many favours afforded thee; <hi>therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life;</hi> that is, As I have formerly done, ſo I will do ſtill; rather than thou ſhalt be deſtroyed, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy whole Nations to preſerve thee; which was accompliſhed in the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> See the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, Chap. 41.10, 14. <hi>I will bring thy ſeed from the Eaſt, and gather thee from the Weſt,</hi> &amp;c. which is meant, 1. of Gods bringing home the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> and other parts of the World, whither they were ſcattered, to their own Country; See the Note, Chap. 11.12. for indeed there is no queſtion to be made, but that upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> many fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and into other Countries; and that of thoſe that were carried Captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> many were ſold to other Nations. But, 2ly. under this type it is principally meant of Gods calling the Gentiles from all parts of the World, according to that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I will ſay to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not back,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken with reference to that which was ſaid before, Chap. 42.22. <hi>they are for a prey, and none delivereth: for a ſpoil, and none ſaith, Reſtore:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Though none ſhall appear for their deliverance, yet at my command they ſhall be delivered, even from the remoteſt parts of the World: <hi>bring my Sons from far,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Even every one that is called by my name,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves my people (and ſo even the converted Gentiles may be comprehended too) whom therefore I muſt not diſregard, unleſs I will be regardleſs of mine own name: <hi>for I have created him for my Glory,</hi> to wit, that they may live to my Glory; Or, that I may be glorified in all my glorious Attributes by all the great things that I do for them: <hi>I have formed him, yea I have made him,</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.]</hi> Some underſtand this as a continuation of the foregoing promiſe; as if it had been ſaid, Then ſhall thoſe poor ſouls be brought forth out of Bondage, that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpiritually blind, but then ſhall be enlightned to ſee what they could not ſee before; and that were before deaf, but then ſhall hear; which may be underſtood both of the <hi>Jews</hi> brought back out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and likewiſe of the converted Gentiles: See the Notes, Chap. 29.18. and 35.5. and 42.16, 19, 20. But others hold, that here the Lord begins again to repeat his former Expoſtulation with all the idolatrous Nations, Chap. 42.1. challenging, that they might be brought forth into Judgment; who, though they had eyes and ears, yet were as blind and deaf as if they had none, to wit, that they might prove their Idol-gods to be really Gods, as they profeſſed them to be. And this, indeed, is more agreeable to the context, and to the challenge we have in the following verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:42788:212"/>Ver. 9. <hi>Let all the Nations be gathered together, and let the people be aſſembled,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words the Heathen Nations are ſummoned to make good the Deity of their Idol-gods, as before, Chap. 41.1. for which ſee the Note there: and that as there, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. by foretelling future things: <hi>Who among them can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this?</hi> that is, Who among their Idol-gods, or who among theſe idolatrous Nations, by revelation from their Idol-gods, can declare this which I have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning the deliverance of my people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the great work of mans Redemption by Chriſt, or any ſuch like? and therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>and ſhew us former things;</hi> for which ſee the Note, Chap. 41.22. <hi>let them bring forth their witneſſes, that they may be juſtified,</hi> to wit, thoſe that can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they have truly foretold things to come; ſee the Note, Chap. 41.26. <hi>or let them hear and ſay, It is truth,</hi> that is, Let them hearken to what I have ſaid, and be convinced thereby, and yield that they are indeed no gods; Or, let them hear what I ſay, or what my witneſs ſhall teſtifie, and ſo confeſs it to be true, that I am God alone.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Ye are my witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing verſe challenged the Idolatrous Nations to produce their witneſſes, that might teſtifie what thoſe future things were which their Idol-gods had foretold, thereby to prove that they were indeed Gods; here he undertakes on his own behalf to do the like: <hi>ye are my witneſſes, ſaith the Lord,</hi> that is, ye my people that have heard ſo many future things foretold by me, and have afterward ſeen them accompliſhed. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the following words, <hi>and my ſervant whom I have choſen,</hi> are diverſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Expoſitors. For, 1. ſome joyning it to the foregoing words, take it thus; That the <hi>Jews</hi> were his Witneſſes, and his Servant whom he had choſen, See the Notes, Chap. 41.8. and 42.19. 2ly. Others underſtand it of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in general, Gods peculiar Servant. 3ly. Others hold, that it is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in particular, to whoſe Teſtimony God here ſpeaks, becauſe he had by Revelation from God, foretold ſo many things that came exactly to paſs. But becauſe it may ſeem probable that this is ſpoken with reference to that which was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Chap. 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth;</hi> therefore I rather think, that it is the ſame choice Servant of whom he there ſpake, that is here intended, to wit, either <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as ſome there think) who indeed gave a glorious Teſtimony to God in this regard; See the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.2. Or elſe rather Chriſt, in whom the chief things now foretold by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was fulfilled, and who is often mentioned in the Scripture as Gods peculiar choiceſt Witneſs; See Chap. 55.4. <hi>John</hi> 18.37. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.4. <hi>that ye may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, and underſtand that I am he:</hi> as if he had ſaid, I appeal to your ſeeing the things accompliſhed which I have foretold, that hereby ye may be fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I am the only true God; and I appeal to the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe by him ye ſhall be further confirmed in the truth of that which I now call you to atteſt: <hi>before me there was no God formed, neither ſhall there be after me:</hi> that is There was never any of your Idol-gods before me, gods of mens forming; nor ſhall there be any God after me, becauſe I am the only everlaſting and eternal God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:42788:213"/>Ver. 12. <hi>I have declared, and have ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I have foretold that I would deliver you from your enemies, and accordingly did deliver you (and this indeed was another evidence whereby the Idol-gods were challenged to prove themſelves true Gods; See the Note, Chap. 41.23.) <hi>and I have ſhewed,</hi> that is, I have by my Prophets made theſe things known to my people, <hi>when there was no ſtrange God among you,</hi> to wit, that could foretel thoſe things at that time; See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord your Redeemer, the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, Chap. 1.4. <hi>for your ſake I have ſent to Babylon,</hi> to wit, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with his <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians; and have brought down all their Nobles,</hi> to wit, from that heigth of Glory wherein they formerly lived. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>All their bars,</hi> and ſo ſome underſtand it of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his beating down <hi>Babylons</hi> ſtrong Walls and Fortifications, becauſe theſe were as bars to keep out an Enemy from breaking into their City; See the Note, Chap. 45.1. yet it may be as well meant of <hi>their Nobles,</hi> or men of War, who are uſually accounted the ſtrength and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a City: <hi>and the Chaldeans whoſe cry is in the ſhips;</hi> to wit, either, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they uſed to make a great ſhouting in their ſhips by way of glorying and vaunting herein, wherein they abounded by means of their two great Rivers, <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris:</hi> Or, 2ly. becauſe of the confuſed and ſad out cry that was in their ſhips, when they fled thither to preſerve themſelves, the City being taken; eſpecially when they perceived they could not ſail in their ſhips, the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> being ſo far drained away by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Or, when the poor captive <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were ſhipped by the Conqueror to be ſold for ſlaves in other Countries. And all this we muſt know the Prophet ſpeaks of, as of a thing done already, the better to ſet forth the certainty of it. To which ſome add, That the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is mentioned as a pledge of their greater Redemption by Chriſt, that had been now promiſed them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>I am the Lord, your holy one, the Creator of Iſrael, your King.]</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which maketh a way in the Sea, and a path in the mighty waters.]</hi> This laſt clauſe ſome underſtand of the Lords dividing <hi>Jordan</hi> before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> even at that time when there was a mighty inundation of the waters thereof; ſee the Note, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.15. But I rather think, that both branches are meant of Gods carrying the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dry-ſhod thorough <hi>the mighty waters</hi> (as they are called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.10.) of the Red Sea; and that becauſe in the following verſe he ſeems clearly to ſpeak of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being drowned therein. And the reaſon why God puts them in mind of this, is hereby to let them ſee, that they had no cauſe to queſtion their promiſed deliverance out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> what he had formerly done for their Fathers, he could do again for them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Which bringeth forth the chariot and horſe, the army and the power,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Who at his pleaſure doth by his all-ruling providence bring forth the great and mighty Armies of Princes, meerly that he might deſtroy them; even as by hardning the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his Princes and People (for by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of this upon the foregoing verſe it is clear, that hereto the Prophet alludes) he brought them forth to purſue the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the Wilderneſs, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42788:213"/>
afterward to follow them into the Red Sea: <hi>they ſhall lye down together, they ſhall not riſe;</hi> that is, They ſhall be irrecoverably deſtroyed, to wit, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Army were. And becauſe this was done by drowning them in the Red Sea, therefore are the following words added, <hi>they are extinct, they are quenched as tow,</hi> that is, They are as eaſily and ſuddenly deſtroyed as the ſnuff of a Candle (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.3.) is extinguiſhed when it is thrown into the water; which doth notably ſet forth the deſtroying of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Army in the Red Sea, when they came out with ſuch burning rage againſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And ſome think that this Compariſon of quenching Tow or Flax, is the rather uſed in alluſion to <hi>Egypt,</hi> that did abound in thoſe kind of Commodities; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Remember ye not the former things,</hi> &amp;c.] It is as if he had ſaid, That the things he did now foretel, were ſo wonderful and ſtrange, that they would be ſufficient of themſelves ſo to convince men of Gods infinite power, that there would be no need to call to mind Gods former deliverance of his people out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Or, as moſt Expoſitors underſtand it, That that former deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though very wonderful, was not worthy to be thought of in compariſon of that which he had now promiſed to do for them. And hereby I conceive is joyntly meant the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and likewiſe, yea principally, that ſpiritual deliverance of Gods people by Chriſt, which was ſignified thereby; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1. For, firſt, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though there were not ſo many ſtrange miracles wrought for the effecting of that, as were for the bringing of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet in many regards that of bringing them back out of <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country, might well be looked upon as the greater and more wonderful mercy, as namely (beſides other reaſons that might be given) 1. Becauſe they were in a more glorious Eſtate when they were carried away Captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> than when they were brought into Bondage by the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and ſo as their miſery was greater when they were made Bond-ſlaves in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo the mercy was greater when they were freed from this Bondage. And, 2ly. Becauſe it was in ſome reſpect a wonder above all the wonders wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and moſt unexpected and ſtrange in the eyes of Gods people, that a Heathen King ſhould of his own accord take ſo much care to ſend back Gods poor captive people into their own Country, and give them back all the rich Veſſels of the Temple, and take ſuch ſtrict order that they ſhould be furniſhed with all neceſſary Proviſions, both for their Journey homeward, and for the rebuilding of their City and Temple when they came thither. And therefore we ſee that elſewhere the Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> is mentioned as a mercy to be prized above the other, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>The days come, ſaith the Lord, that it ſhall no more be ſaid, The Lord liveth that brought up the Children of Iſrael out of the land of Egypt; But the Lord liveth that brought up the Children of Iſrael from the Land of the North,</hi> &amp;c. But ſecondly, the Redemption of Gods people was ſo far tranſcendently above the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that it might well be ſaid, that the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was not worthy to be minded in compariſon of this. And this therefore is queſtionleſs chiefly here intended. So that as by <hi>the former things,</hi> not to be comparatively remembred, is meant their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> together
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42788:214"/>
with all that followed, unto their being put into poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo by the greater deliverance that had been now promiſed, which ſhould make the former things to be in a manner forgotten, is meant their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even unto that which was ſignified thereby, that great work of mans Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Behold, I will do a new thing,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a new and notable work, far above what I have formerly done; whereby is joyntly meant the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> together with that great work, of our Redemption by Chriſt, whereof that was a type; See the foregoing Note. And though neither of theſe were done till very many years after, yet he ſpeaks of them (as the manner of the Prophets is, to imply the certainty of things) as of that which ſhould be done within a ſhort time: <hi>now it ſhall ſpring forth;</hi> and that becauſe Gods Providence would be preſently working towards the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe things, and eſpecially becauſe ſeveral ages are but as a moment with God; See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4. <hi>ſhall ye not know it?</hi> that is, it ſhall be certainly done, and that ſo that you ſhall take notice of it as an Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is now promiſed: <hi>I will even make a way in the Wilderneſs,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3, 4. <hi>and rivers in the deſert,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.7, 8. and 41.18. It is meant of the fair, and ſafe, and comfortable paſſage which God would give them in their return through the deſerts from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Judea;</hi> and likewiſe ſpiritually of making a way in the Wilderneſs of the Gentiles, for bringing in of people to Chriſt, and life eternal.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>The beaſts of the field ſhall honour me, the Dragons and the Owls,</hi> &amp;c.] As this is ſpoken with reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> either it may be an hyperbolical Expreſſion to ſet forth the wonder of Gods providing ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and bountifully for his people in their return through thoſe dry and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren deſerts, through which they went; as if it had been ſaid, That the very bruit beaſts ſhould ſtand amazed at it, and adore the mighty power of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and his fatherly love to his people therein; or elſe the meaning may be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the very unreaſonable Creatures did <hi>honour</hi> God by forbearing to do his people any hurt, that ſo their paſſages through thoſe deſerts might be the freer and ſafer; or elſe, that they fared the better, becauſe of the bounty of God to his people, even as when God brought water out of the rock for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the wild beaſts of the wilderneſs were refreſhed thereby; for as when ſuch Creatures do languiſh for want of food, they may be ſaid to cry unto God for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.21. ſo when they delight themſelves in the proviſion God affords them, and are cheared therewith, they may be ſaid in their kind to praiſe God for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.7. And thus the Beaſts that were refreſhed with Gods bounty to his people, are ſaid to honour God for it; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I give waters in the Wilderneſs, and rivers in the deſert, to give drink to my people, my choſen.</hi> But now, if we take this as ſpoken with reſpect to that greater work of our Redemption by Chriſt, then it muſt be underſtood of the Gentiles, a bruitiſh people, being called into the Church, and honouring God for thoſe waters of Life, wherewith God had refreſhed their ſouls; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.]</hi> Some think this is ſpoken of the Gentiles, whoſe Converſion they conceived is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42788:214"/>
foretold in the foregoing verſe; and that by way of oppoſing them to, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them before the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whoſe wickedneſs God complains in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe. But rather it is ſpoken of Gods peculiar people in general, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.18. And they imply a reaſon why God would certainly deliver them, namely, becauſe having formed them for himſelf and for his own Glory, he was engaged to deliver them, even out of reſpect to his own honour, that he might have a people to praiſe his Name.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, You my people, the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have not called upon me in your troubles, as having indeed no confidence in my protection and help. But rather by calling upon God here, as uſually elſewhere, the whole worſhip of God is meant; and accordingly I take theſe words, <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob,</hi> to be all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, You think that you have called upon me, and ſo have yielded me that honour for which I made you my people (as it is ſaid in the foregoing verſe) but it is not ſo; you have not called upon me, but upon an Idol-god of your own feigning; a god which will be content meerly with external Worſhip, which I abhor, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.13. nor do ever own thoſe Prayers as ſervice done to me, which are not offered with the inward Devotion of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, holy, and obedient heart; and ſo <hi>thou haſt not called upon me, but thou haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael;</hi> that is, it hath been a burden to thee to ſerve me. And the drift of the Lords alledging this, is, ſay ſome, to ſhew what juſt cauſe he had to caſt off them, and take in the Gentiles to be his people. But rather it is to ſhew, that their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> now promiſed them, and likewiſe the great work of our deliverance by Chriſt, would be meerly of Gods free Grace, and not becauſe they had deſired any ſuch favour from him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Thou haſt not brought me the ſmall cattel of thy burnt-offerings, neither haſt thou honoured me with thy ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, Thou haſt not offered them to me, but to Idols. And ſo they underſtand alſo the following clauſe, <hi>I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incenſe;</hi> that is, I have not exacted ſuch abundance of theſe kind of oblations of thee, as therewith to over-burden thee, and to make thee weary of my ſervice: no, it is thine Idols for whom thou haſt been at ſo much coſt, and upon whom thou haſt tired out thy ſelf with offering them ſuch a multitude of Sacrifices. But rather the meaning is, that becauſe they did not offer them in a right manner, God did not own them as ſacrifices offered to him; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.11. &amp;c. they were not the ſervice which he had given them in charge.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Thou haſt bought me no ſweet cane with money,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, for the precious Ointment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23. or for the Incenſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7. wherewith it is therefore joyned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.6. It is thought to be the ſame that is elſewhere called <hi>Calamus, Ezek.</hi> 27.19. and it is ſpoken of as a coſtly thing, becauſe it grew not in their own land, but was brought from far Countries: <hi>neither haſt thou fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me with the fat of thy ſacrifices,</hi> that is, Thou haſt not ſatisfied nor delighted me with thy ſacrifices, I never regarded them; See the foregoing Note: <hi>but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with impoſing upon thee too great a burden of ſacrifices, but thou haſt cauſed me to ſerve with thy
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42788:215"/>
wickedneſs; to wit, becauſe thy ſins have been as great a grief, and trouble, and burden to me, as it is to men to ſerve under hard Task-Maſters; and I have been as much wearied with bearing with thee, as ſuch a man can be with enduring ſuch a hard ſervice.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake,</hi> &amp;c.] And not in regard of any deſert of yours; and ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Put me in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, If you have any thing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or reply againſt this which I have charged you, let me know it; Or, if there be any thing wherewith you have deſerved your deliverance, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins promiſed, put me in mind of it; for it may be I have forgotten it, and therefore you ſhall do well to bring it into my remembrance; which is ſpoken by way of a ſharp ironical deriſion: <hi>let us plead together,</hi> to wit, that the truth betwixt us may be known; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. <hi>declare thou, that thou mayeſt be juſtified,</hi> that is, Say what you can for your ſelves, alledge what it is whereby you have deſerved that I ſhould work ſo great a deliverance, and ſo great ſalvation for you, that hereby you may be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Thy firſt Father hath ſinned,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father of all Mankind; and think that this is mentioned, becauſe ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing traduced from him to all his Poſterity, they that were deſcended from ſuch a corrupt ſtock, muſt needs be ſinners themſelves. Again, becauſe this ſeems to be ſpoken with more ſpecial reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> others underſtand it of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and that with reſpect to his being an Idolater before his calling, ſee the Notes, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2. And indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> is uſually ſpoken of in the Scripture as the <hi>firſt Father</hi> of that Nation, becauſe he was firſt circumciſed, which was the ſign whereby they were always afterwards diſtinguiſhed from other Nations, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.2. <hi>Look unto Abraham your Father.</hi> And they uſed to glory much in this, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. and <hi>John</hi> 8.39. But indeed the moſt of our beſt Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hold, That hereby is meant their Anceſtors in general: <hi>Thy firſt Father,</hi> which is all one as if he had ſaid, Thy fore-father <hi>hath ſinned;</hi> and the word <hi>Father</hi> being uſually taken collectively (as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Thy Father was an Amorite</hi>) it is all one as if it had been ſaid, Thy fore-fathers have ſinned. And ſo for the following words, <hi>and thy teachers have tranſgreſſed againſt me;</hi> thereby I conceive is plainly meant their Prieſts and Prophets; and that this is added as an aggravation of the wickedneſs both of them and their Fathers, that even they that taught others, and ſo ſhould have been themſelves moſt exemplary for good, were even as bad as others. And ſo the drift of the whole verſe, I conceive, is to ſhew, that ſeeing their fore-fathers had been great Tranſgreſſors as well as themſelves, they could not aſcribe the great deliverances which God had now promiſed, to any goodneſs that God had found either in them, or in their Fathers. Indeed this people did uſe to glory much in their Fathers; but God gives them to underſtand, that had there been nothing elſe to move him to ſhew them mercy, they had been deſtroyed long ago.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>Therefore I have profaned the Princes of the Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c.] Reading this as it is in our Bibles, I conceive it is clearly meant of thoſe, at leaſt the chief of thoſe, that in the foregoing verſe were called their <hi>Teachers,</hi> the chief of their
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42788:215"/>
Prieſts and Levites, ſuch as had the chief command in Gods Sanctuary, and that are called, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.1. <hi>chief Governours in the houſe of the Lord;</hi> but as it is in the Margin, <hi>the holy Princes;</hi> their Kings and Princes may be alſo intended, who are ſo called, becauſe they ruled over Gods holy people. And theſe may be ſaid to have been <hi>prophaned,</hi> when they were ſlain and ſold for ſlaves, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way uſed as baſely and contemptuouſly as any of the ordinary ſort of people; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.39. <hi>and have given Jacob to the curſe, and Iſrael to reproaches;</hi> that is, I have given them up, even thoſe that were my peculiar people, to be deſtroyed as an accurſed thing, and to be expoſed to all kind of Reproaches; they ſhall be looked upon amongſt the Nations as an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable and accurſed people. And this may be underſtood as ſpoken, either with reſpect to that which God had already done to them in all the Judgments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which at ſeveral times he had formerly brought upon them, eſpecially the Ruine and Deſolation he had brought upon the ten Tribes by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> or rather with reſpect to what God had determined to bring upon them by the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> for it is uſual with the Prophets to expreſs the certainty of what 0 they foretel, by ſpeaking of ſuch things as if they were done already.</p>

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the many Prophets that God would raiſe up amongſt them in <hi>Babylon, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai</hi> &amp;c. and others, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant gifts of the Spirit which God would pour forth upon the Preachers of the Goſpel in the days of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> with reſpect whereto they conceive the next clauſe is added by way of expounding this, <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. But rather the meaning is, That the Church and people of God that were as a dry, thirſty, and barren wilderneſs, where nothing almoſt grows and thrives, but all things ſeem in a manner dead, ſhall by the bleſſing of God become as a well-watered ground where all things thrive and flouriſh; that is, They ſhall multiply and proſper exceedingly, which is more plainly expreſſed in the following words; <hi>I will pour forth my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring;</hi> where what is meant by Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſee in the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. And this I conceive is meant of the abundance of Mercy and Grace which God afforded the <hi>Jews</hi> at their return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and afterward to his Church both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the days of the Goſpel; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1, 7. and 41.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, They ſhall multiply, grow up, and flouriſh abundantly, even as plants and trees do, that grow in green and fruitful Medows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, My people ſhall with one conſent after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> renounce all Idol-gods, and ſhall give up themſelves wholly and only to the worſhip of the true God. But rather this is ſpoken of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Gods people, as with reference to that which went before, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that though they ſhould be but a few, to ſpeak of, at their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet by degrees they ſhould become very Numerous; which is ſpoken princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with reſpect to the calling of the Gentiles: <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Several perſons of ſeveral ſorts ſhall come in from all Places and Nations, and give up their names to Chriſt, and yield up themſelves to be wholly at his command, and ſhall make open profeſſion of Chriſt and of his Goſpel, and ſo ſhall joyn themſelves to Gods <hi>Iſrael;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.4.</p>

               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>The Smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and faſhioneth it with hammers,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the Smiths forging out Tools for the Carpenter that was to make the Idol. But it is expreſly ſaid, that the Heathens had Idol-gods <hi>of iron,</hi> Dan. 5.4. as well as of other metals; and of theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive the Prophet here ſpeaks, or of the Iron work that was uſed about their Idols: <hi>and worketh it with the ſtrength of his arms:</hi> that is, he puts forth all his might in the forging of it; which is ſpoken by way of deriding their blind zeal, and ſo is likewiſe that which followeth: <hi>yea, he is hungry, and his ſtrength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint:</hi> to wit, as being ſo intent upon his holy work, that he cannot afford himſelf time to eat or drink. Yet this mention of his hungring and thirſting may be alſo covertly to imply, both what a poor Creature ſuch a one is, to undertake to make a God; and what vain things ſuch Gods are that cannot keep their Servants from fainting, when they take ſuch pains for them, unleſs they feed on the meat which the true God. hath provided for men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Carpenter ſtretcheth out his rule,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to meaſure out the length and breadth of the timber to be ſet apart for the making of his Idol: <hi>he marketh it out with a line,</hi> to wit, to ſhew how much of the timber on every ſide muſt be cut away; <hi>he fitteth it with plains, and he marketh it out with the compaſs,</hi> to wit, that he might draw out every member with its due Proportion; <hi>and maketh it after the figure of a man,</hi> that is, a Man or Woman; <hi>according to the beauty of a man;</hi> that is, That noble and majeſtick ſhape which God hath given to man; <hi>that it may remain in the houſe;</hi> that is, in ſome Temple, or in his own dwelling houſe, for his own private Devotions. However, this covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hints their folly; their Idols, after their pains and coſt, not being able to do any thing, and ſo ſerving only to ſtand idle, and fill up a Room in their houſes.</p>

But many do rather like that Tranſlation which we have in our Margin; <hi>and he taketh courage to himſelf among the trees of the foreſt,</hi> that is, he encourageth himſelf to take the faireſt timber-trees for this ſervice, and to put forth his utmoſt ſtrength in hewing them down: <hi>he planteth an Aſh,</hi> to wit, that there may be Timber for their Idol-gods in future times (whereby alſo is hinted their reſolvedneſs for

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the reſidue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven Image: he falleth down to it, and worſhippeth it,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He doth not only provide this Idol for the uſe of others, but he himſelf alſo worſhips it; <hi>and prayeth unto it, and ſaith, Deliver me, for thou art my God:</hi> which is ſo ſet forth to imply, That men cannot worſhip and pray to an Idol, but they own it for their God.</p>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>He feedeth of aſhes,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Idolater doth as miſerably deceive himſelf, as he ſhould do that thinks to ſlake his hunger, and nouriſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with eating aſhes; for as aſhes eaten would be ſo far from doing men any good in theſe regards, that it would rather hurt them; ſo it is with the Idolater: he ſets his heart upon that, he delights himſelf and truſts in that, and ſo feeds himſelf with hopes of Benefit and Comfort from that which will no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him, but rather do him a great deal of Miſchief, namely, his Idols, pieces of wood that ſhall one day be turned into aſhes, as well as the reſt of the trees of which they are made, and therefore no way likely to help them in their ſtraits, but rather to draw the wrath of God upon them. It is an Expreſſion much like to that, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Ephraim feedeth on wind;</hi> implying, That the Idolater feeds himſelf with the vain deceits of his own heart: <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived heart hath turned him aſide,</hi> to wit, out of the way of truth, <hi>that he cannot deliver his ſoul,</hi> that is, He cannot wind himſelf out of this fooliſh Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo ſave himſelf from that Vengeance and Damnation which this his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition is like to bring upon him; <hi>nor ſay, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</hi> that is, Is not this Idol which I am forming, or which I hold in my right hand, an Error and Deceit, a meer Fiction, no ſuch thing as I have falſely conceited it to be?

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Drop down ye heavens from above, and let the skies pour down righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] Under this command a promiſe is implied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, and delivering Gods people from their Bondage there, and ſending them home again into their own Country; which is here called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it was a work of great Righteouſneſs in God thus to puniſh the wicked <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and to deliver his poor oppreſſed people, and becauſe thereby he approved his Faithfulneſs and Juſtice in performing what he had before-hand promiſed them. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>let the earth open,</hi> to wit, to receive the ſhowrs from above, or to let forth that which is to ſpring up, as it follows; <hi>and let them,</hi> to wit, the earth watered by the Heavens, <hi>bring forth Salvation, and let Righteouſneſs ſpring forth together.</hi> As for this figurative Expreſſion whereby this promiſe is expreſſed, <hi>Drop down ye Heavens from above, and let the skies pour down Righteouſneſs; let the earth open, and let them bring forth Salvation; and let righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſpring forth together;</hi> that is uſed to imply, 1. By whoſe command this ſhould be done (and that to the end Gods people ſhould not look upon this
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42788:220"/>
deliverance promiſed as an impoſſible thing, in regard of the deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be at that time) namely, That God from Heaven would ſuddenly and miraculouſly cauſe it to be done. And, 2ly. how wonderfully great this Deliverance ſhould be, and what an abundant diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very there ſhould be made therein of the goodneſs, righteouſneſs and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God; for it is all one in effect as if God had ſaid, I the Lord, who do cauſe the Heavens to water the Earth, and the Earth thereupon to yield all kind of Fruit abundantly, will from Heaven afford you ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo abundantly manifeſt my Righteouſneſs therein, that it ſhall be with you, as if the Heavens did rain whole ſhowrs of it upon you; and as if a plentiful crop of it did every where ſpring out of the earth: See the Note, <hi>chap.</hi> 44.3. And herein alſo may be comprehended the raiſing up of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as a branch of Righteouſneſs ſpringing up (according to the like Expreſſions elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for which ſee the Note, Chap. 4.2.) by whom this great Salvation ſhould be wrought for them. But however, under this promiſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that greater Deliverance is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, whereof this was a type, namely, the Redemption of Gods people from the Bondage of their natural Eſtate by the Lord Chriſt; and that as the happy effect of that typical Deliverance: for, indeed, had not the outward Polity of the <hi>Jews</hi> been preſerved by their Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chriſt could not have ſprung up out of the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> to be a Saviour for his redeemed, as God had promiſed. I know this paſſage is expounded by ſome in ſomewhat a different way. For, 1. ſome underſtand it thus, That Heaven and Earth ſhould concur to afford their help for the effecting of that great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which God had now in hand. And, 2ly. others underſtand it both of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant bliſs, ſafety and righteous dealing, which Gods people ſhould enjoy by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to them; and likewiſe of that fulneſs of all ſpiritual Bleſſings, which the Church ſhould enjoy under the Kingdom of Chriſt. But the Expoſition formerly given, I conceive, is the beſt; yet ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6, 7. and 85.11. As for the laſt clauſe, <hi>I the Lord have created it,</hi> it ſeems added with reference to that which went before, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and that to aſſure them, that how impoſſible ſoever that might ſeem to be, which he had promiſed, yet it ſhould certainly come to paſs; to which purpoſe he ſpeaks of it as done already, <hi>I the Lord have created it;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I the Lord, who do by mine Almighty power what I pleaſe, will effect this.</p>

And this might be ſpoken as by way of declaring in general the evil and danger of oppoſing or muttering againſt any Counſel or Acting of Divine Providence, upon occaſion of that which God had ſaid before, that all that was done in the World, was done by his all-ruling Providence, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. yet it ſeems rather to have been intended more particularly either againſt the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> to ſhew that nothing but miſery and wo would be the Iſſue of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what God intended to do; or rather againſt the murmuring of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> eſpecially as to that which God had now promiſed to do for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Becauſe the poor Captives in <hi>Babylon</hi> might think with themſelves, Why ſhould the Lord bring us his peculiar people under the tyrannical Bondage of ſuch a barbarous Nation, if he meant afterward to deſtroy them, and to deliver us, and ſend us back into our own Country? Or, why ſhould he defer our Deliverance ſo long? Or, why ſhould he not raiſe up one of our own Nation to do it, as he hath formerly done (even this alſo ſome add) but bring a Prince from ſo remote a Country to ſet us free? And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for that which God had promiſed concerning that great Deliverance by Chriſt, becauſe men might argue within themſelves, Why was Chriſt ſent no ſooner? or why ſhould the <hi>Jews</hi> be caſt off, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called into their room? Againſt theſe, and all ſuch Arguings with God, this is here oppoſed; <hi>Wo unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker;</hi> and then he adds, <hi>let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth: ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou?</hi> that is, What intendeſt thou to make of me?

And the drift of this is to ſhew, that if it would be an unreaſonable and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous thing to think, that the clay ſhould quarrel with the Potter about his Workmanſhip, or call him to an account concerning the work he made of it; much more unreaſonable would it be for man, whom God formed out of the earth as the Potter doth his Veſſels of clay, to contend with his Maker about any thing he doth to him; and that the rather, becauſe the clay was not made by the Potter; whereas man had not only his form and ſhape, but his very being from God; and therefore it muſt needs be free for the Creator to do whatever he pleaſed with his Creatures.

Or, why haſt thou begotten me ſo weak, ſo ſickly, ſo unhandſome, ſo deformed, or of ſo mean inward parts as I am? Or, why haſt thou begotten me ſubject to the ſame Miſeries as other men are? The drift of the words is the ſame with that in the foregoing verſe, to wit, to imply, that it is as baſe a thing to call God to an account for any thing he doth, as it is for a Child to quarrel with his Parents about their begetting him.</p>

future things, as he the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, as before, Chap. 41.22. &amp;c. and in ſeveral places afterward) and if you like not what you ſhall hear I mean to to do, you had beſt command me to do otherwiſe, and ſo hinder me from doing what I intended; or <hi>Ask of me,</hi> &amp;c. that is, You had beſt call me to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and lay your Command upon me, not to deliver my people by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as I have ſaid I will do.

Therefore you are overwhelmed with grief in your Miſeries, becauſe you will not ask Counſel of me; whereas, if you would enquire of me, in this you might, as it were, command me; ſo ready I would be to inform you; and ſo you might hear what might comfort you, how careful I am for you, and what a good iſſue I will give to your troubles.

ſend them home into their own Country freely, without any ranſome or conſideration received for it. But now ſtill we muſt remember, that under this Type of the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that greater work of our redemption by Chriſt from our ſpiritual Bondage, is principally here intended; for he indeed was raiſed up of God <hi>in righteouſneſs,</hi> (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.6.) for the effecting of this great work, and had all his ways made ſtraight before him, (See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.4.)

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, The labour of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and merchandiſe of</hi> Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, &amp;c.] That is, The wealth, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> get by their labour, and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> by their Merchandiſe; <hi>and of the</hi> Sabeans, <hi>men of ſtature,</hi> That is, of great ſtature, tall, big and goodly men, <hi>ſhall come over unto thee;</hi> That is, ſhall be brought into thee; <hi>and thy ſhall be thine:</hi> That is, not only the riches of the Nations before mentioned, but even the Nations themſelves ſhall be thine, they that were before thine enemies, ſhall become thy Servants. Some, and that very probably, do underſtand this as ſpoken to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of whom it is clear that he ſpake in the foregoing verſe, to wit, that as a recompence of the ſervice he ſhould do for God, in deſtroying the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ſetting free his People, both theſe mighty Nations, and the wealth of their rich Countrys, ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Babylon</hi> fall into his hands. But others again take it to be ſpoken to Gods people, to wit, That theſe Nations ſhould bring in their wealth to them, and be ſerviceable to them: which they think was partly fulfilled, when theſe Nations, at the commandment of <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1.4. and of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did out of the tributes which they were to pay to the Emperor of <hi>Perſia,</hi> afford them all things requiſite for their return home into their own Country, and for the work they had to do, when they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But eſpcially in the days of the Goſpel, when both theſe and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did joyn themſelves to the Church, and imployed their riches for her advancement. See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12. and 68.31. and 72.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed they that underſtand this as ſpoken to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> do withal hold, that it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally meant of Chriſt, of whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a Type. Nor needs it ſeem ſtrange that the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Gods People by Chriſt, ſhould be thus ſtill joyntly intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe the main end of God's delivering the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was, that Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah, might ſpring up of that Nation, and ſo his Kingdom might be eſtabliſhed in the World. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>and they ſhall come after thee, in chains ſhall they come over,</hi> to wit, as captives are wont to follow the Conqueror in his triumphs; <hi>and they ſhall fall down unto thee, they ſhall make Supplication unto thee, ſaying, ſurely God is in thee, and there is none elſe, there is no God,</hi> to wit, beſides; for as this may be literally underſtood of the Nations crouching before <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and acknowledging that God was apparently w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Verily thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Saviour.]</hi> Here the Prophet breaks forth into an admiration of the hidden depths of Gods Diſpenſations; for therefore is God ſaid to be a God that hideth himſelf; 1. Becauſe of the ſecrecy and unſearchableneſs of his Councels in the actings of his providences, (as in the raiſing up <hi>Cyrus</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon:</hi> God's purpoſe for the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> thereby would not have been thought of; and when it was done, Gods hand in doing it, had not God revealed it, would not have been ſeen.) And 2ly. Eſpecially, becauſe though God be the ſure Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his People, yet he often ſtands a-loof for a time, and appears not as a Saviour; becauſe he proſpers their enemies, and ſuffers his People to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably oppreſſed by them, as if he regarded them not. And thus by this clauſe the Prophet doth covertly perſwade the <hi>Jews,</hi> not to murmure againſt God, according to what was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. But patiently to wait upon him for Deliverance in their loweſt condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus the Prophet applieth that which was ſpoken in the foregoing verſe in general terms, to the particular condition of Gods People, <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed, and alſo confounded all of them:</hi> to wit, the idolatrous <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as the following words explain it; <hi>they ſhall go to confuſion together that are makers of Idols;</hi> this ſhall be at laſt the end of all their flouriſhing greatneſs. See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, by the Lord: <hi>with an everlaſting Salvation;</hi> That is, ſay ſome, in all ages: or ſo that they ſhall never periſh; they ſhall be ſaved unto eternity; which is alledged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Expoſitors as an evidence, that the eternal Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt for his People, is here alſo comprehended, whereof the deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was only a Type; <hi>ye ſhall not be aſhamed, nor confounded World without end.</hi> That is, ye ſhall not always find your ſelves diſappointed of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which ye expect from your God; as he had ſaid in the foregoing verſe it ſhould be with thoſe that worſhipped Idols.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord that created the Heavens, God himſelf that formed the Earth, and made it,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. yet ſome think, that Gods creating all things is here mentioned as an evidence that he was the only true God, and that therefore they that worſhipped him, ſhould not be confounded, as all idolaters ſhould be; as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe: <hi>he hath eſtabliſhed it,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.1. <hi>He created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited;</hi> to wit, by the Children of men. And the drift of mentioning this, may ſeem to be hereby to imply, that if God hath been thus careful to provide an habitation for all mankind, much more will he be ſure to provide an habitation for his own peculiar People that muſt continue on the Earth ſo long as the Earth ſhall ſtand. This, I conceive, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the drift of this place. Yet ſome, I know, do by <hi>the Earth</hi> here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God had provided for the habitation of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

And becauſe, when People reſorted thither for ſatisfaction in any thing they deſired to know, the Devil was wont cunningly to return them anſwers, as dark as the Caves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were given, obſcure and ambiguous, that might always be underſtood ſeveral ways, that ſo, whatever the event was, it might be thought he had foretold the truth; therefore in an alluſion hereto, the Lord intending to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to his People, that he had not ſpoken to them after ſuch a manner, doth thus expreſs himſelf, <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark place of the Earth;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I have always from time to time made known my will to you openly, plainly and perſpicuouſly; and not as the idolatrous nations were informed by their Oracles. And it may well be, which ſome have thought, that it was with reſpect to this of the Prophet, that Chriſt ſpake that of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 18.20. <hi>I ſpake openly to the World: I ever taught in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and in the Temple, whither the</hi> Jews <hi>always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi> However the drift of this paſſage ſeems probably to be, to make known to Gods people, that tho' the Lord might ſeem to hide himſelf from them, as was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. by the ſtrange diſpenſations of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards them, yet having ſo clearly and openly revealed his will to them, that if they ſerved him faithfully, and fled unto him in their ſtreights and troubles, he would certainly deliver them, on this they might with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence rely, however things went: and that becauſe, as his promiſes were clear and plain, ſo they were ſure and faithful; which is intended in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain;</hi> I do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage my people to ſeek unto me in vain, and to no purpoſe, by promiſing that which they ſhall not find in due time exactly performed: <hi>I the Lord ſpeak righteouſneſs, I declare things that are right.</hi> That is, I ſpeak nothing but what is true and juſt, and what in the event they ſhall find to be ſo.</p>

And the reaſon why the Lord doth thus ſummon theſe nations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that were ſpread abroad all the world over, is, that they might ſay what they could in the defence of their Idol-gods, now when they had ſeen how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they were to defend <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the wrath of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And accordingly ſome conceive, that the following words, <hi>they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that ſet up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot ſave,</hi> are added by way of correction, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Why do I ſummon theſe to ſay what they can? Alas, theſe that worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, are very bruits, and have no knowledg. But rather this ſeems to be added, as a declaration of that which the Heathen nations had experimentally ſeen by Gods deſtroying <hi>Babylon,</hi> and delivering his people, namely, how ſottiſhly ignorant they were that ſerved Idol-gods, that could not ſave them. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed take the firſt words, <hi>Aſſemble your ſelves, and come, draw near together, ye that are eſcaped of the Nations,</hi> to be a prophecy of the converſion of the Gentiles by
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42788:223"/>
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and that theſe are appealed to, as thoſe that were able experimentally to ſpeak in this caſe, having been won from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſerving Idols, to the Worſhip and Service of the true God. But the former Expoſition is clearly the beſt, as is very evident by the following Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Tell ye,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that the Heathen Nations are here enjoined to declare to others, what they had learnt or found by experience concerning the true God; and ſo to invite them to come in and join themſelves to his Church and People: But rather here the cauſe is ſhown why the Nations were ſummoned in the foregoing Verſe to <hi>aſſemble</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and accordingly I conceive that in theſe firſt words, <hi>Tell ye;</hi> either the Nations are appointed to tell one another of the Aſſembly intended or enjoined, as the following words ſeem to import, <hi>Tell ye, and bring them near;</hi> or elſe that they are challenged to tell and ſay what they could by way of defending their Idol-gods; yea, after they had met and conſulted together about it, which is certainly intended in thoſe words, <hi>bring them near, yea let them take Counſel together.</hi> And then in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words the particular is expreſſed, whereby they are challenged to prove their Idol-gods to be true Gods; <hi>who hath declared this from ancient time?</hi> that is, Which of your Idol-gods have foretold things to come, long before they came to paſs, as I have foretold this concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deliverance of my people, and ſo other things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, even from <hi>Abraham</hi> unto this time? <hi>Who hath told it from that time?</hi> that is, from ancient time, as was before ſaid; but ſee alſo the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.8. <hi>have not I the Lord? and there is no God elſe beſides me, a juſt God and a Saviour;</hi> that is, a true God, a God indeed, able to ſave thoſe that ſeek to him. It is the very ſame Argument whereby often before it was proved that Idol-gods were no true Gods, namely, becauſe they could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel future things, nor ſave thoſe that ſerved them, as the true-God did. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.22, 26. and 43.9, 12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Look not to your Idol-gods, that cannot ſave you; but <hi>look unto me,</hi> that is, own me to be the only true God, worſhip me, and ſeek unto me, and truſt in me (ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2.) and ſo ye ſhall be ſaved; to wit, both temporally from your ſtreights and dangers here in this World, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hereafter; and doubtleſs this is ſpoken with reference to Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of calling the Gentiles to be his people, as is clear by the following verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>I have ſwore by my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] Upon occaſion of the foregoing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of all Nations to own the true God, to let them ſee that it would be their wiſeſt courſe ſo to do; here the Lord makes his Purpoſe and Decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his bringing in of all Nations to be his People; and becauſe this might ſeem ſtrange and incredible, eſpecially to the <hi>Jews</hi> that looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as choſen of God to be his peculiar people, therefore he confirms it with an Oath, <hi>I have ſworn by my ſelf,</hi> having no greater to ſwear by, ſaith the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42788:224"/>
Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. <hi>the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, upon good and righteous grounds; (it being unqueſtionably a moſt juſt and righteous thing that all men ſhould own and worſhip the true God) or rather, in truth and faithfulneſs, as being fully reſolved to do what I ſay; <hi>and ſhall not return,</hi> that is, the word I have ſpoken is a Decree ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable, I will never reverſe it; or, it ſhall certainly be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſhall not return without effect, as men often do that go out upon ſome enterpriſe, but are not able to effect what they deſigned; <hi>that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear;</hi> that is, I will ſo manifeſt my ſelf to be the only true God, the multitudes of all Nations that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly worſhipped Idol-gods, and ſworn by them, ſhall then know and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, and ſwear by my Name, or ſwear Fealty and Allegiance to me, ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.18. This is undoubtedly the true meaning of this place: The Apoſtle indeed cites this place as a proof that all mankind throughout the World ſhall at the day of Judgment be brought into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under the power of God in Chriſt, and ſhall ſtand crouching before him, as being forced to acknowledg him their Lord and Judg, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10, 11. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt; for it is written, As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God.</hi> But conſidering that the bowing of all Nations before God in Chriſt at the laſt day by way of owning his Soveraignty and Dominion over them, was a full accompliſhment of that univerſal ſubjection of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, which was begun in the converſion of the Gentiles; What wonder is it that this which is here foretold by the Prophet concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and their owning of the Soveraignty of God in Chriſt, ſhould by the Apoſtle be applyed to the whole Worlds acknowledging of it, and being forced to ſubmit to it, when he ſhall come to judg both quick and dead of all Nations?</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the Margin, <hi>Surely he ſhall ſay of me, In the Lord is all righteouſneſs and ſtrength;</hi> and according to this Tranſlation the meaning is, that the faithful among the Gentiles, even eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, that ſhall turn unto God in Chriſt, and ſhall own and ſerve him, ſhall upon all occaſions be ready to acknowledg and profeſs with much rejoicing, that in him is abundance of Righteouſneſs; that is, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Truth and Faithfulneſs, and an All-ſufficiency of Power to do for them whatever he pleaſeth; this they ſhall find experimentally, and ſo to their comfort ſhall ſee how much better it is with them, than when they ſerved Idol-gods; but now if we read it as it is in our Tranſlation, <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength;</hi> there the meaning ſeems to be, that thoſe Converts before ſpoken of, ſhould be ſtill ready to glory in this, that all their righteouſneſs, both imputed and inherent, and all the ſtrength they had to obey Gods Commandments, was wholly from the Lord; of themſelves they had nothing that was good in them, nor were able to do any thing that was good in Gods ſight: As for that which follows, <hi>even to him ſhall men come, and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed;</hi> ſome underſtand the firſt branch of it, <hi>even to him ſhall men come,</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:42788:224"/>
of the Converts before mentioned, to wit, that they ſhould come in, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the advice before given them, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and join themſelves to God and his people, (ſee the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4.) though before Aliens and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; and then the ſecond Clauſe, <hi>and all that are incenſed againſt him, ſhall be aſhamed,</hi> they underſtand of thoſe wicked Wretches that did obſtinately deſpiſe God, and oppoſe him and his Truth, to wit, that they ſhould be deſtroyed, and thereby be brought to ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of face. But then, others again underſtand both branches of theſe that will not ſtoop to God, but ſtand out againſt him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to Wrath, to wit, that they ſhould perforce come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods Tribunal, and there ſhall be put to Everlaſting Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the Seed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> Some hold the genuine ſenſe of this place to be, That the innocency of the main body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or of the faithful amongſt them, ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Lords Pleading their Cauſe againſt their Enemies, by reſcuing them out of the hands of their Oppreſſors, and taking vengeance on them that had ſo ſorely wronged and vexed them; and that they ſhould <hi>glory</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in this, according to that <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.10. <hi>The Lord hath brought forth our righteouſneſs; come and let us declare in</hi> Zion <hi>the work of the Lord our God.</hi> And indeed the word <hi>(juſtified)</hi> is ſometimes ſo taken, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.8. <hi>He is near that juſtifieth me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, to wit, againſt the falſe aſperſions of mine Adverſaries, <hi>Who will contend with me?</hi> But becauſe there is in the foregoing Verſes, ſuch a clear Prophecy of the Calling and Converſion of the Gentiles; I rather do underſtand it with the general current of Expoſitors, of that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication whereby thoſe that come to God in Chriſt are diſcharged from their Sins, and owned as Juſt in his ſight; and ſome conceive that this is added by way of confirming that triumphing of the faithful, in the foregoing verſe, <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs;</hi> and affirming that ſo it ſhould indeed be; <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> See the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.5. yea, and it may well be, which ſome conceive, that by calling thoſe Converts that ſhould be juſtified and glory in the Lord, <hi>the ſeed of Iſrael,</hi> the Prophet did purpoſely ſeek to prevent the <hi>Jews</hi> any thought that he intended that God would caſt off the <hi>Jews,</hi> and take the Gentiles to be his people in their ſtead; No, God would own them ſtill as his firſt-born People, and the Gentiles ſhould be ingrafted into their Stock, and made the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> together with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. BEL <hi>boweth down,</hi> Nebo <hi>ſtoopeth,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe were the principal Idol-gods of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> thoſe doubtleſs which they eſteemed their great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telary Gods; but under theſe all the reſt of their forged Deities are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; for the drift of the Prophet here is to ſhew, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, together with <hi>Babylon,</hi> even their Idol-gods too, in whom they truſted. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.9. And this might be mentioned alſo as a figure of the utter ruine of Idolatry throughout the World, by the Goſpel of Chriſt; the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> being by all acknowledged to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that great work of our Redemption by Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of <hi>Bel</hi> we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.2. <hi>Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,</hi> &amp;c. and again 41.4. <hi>I will puniſh Bel in</hi> Babylon; and in <hi>Pliny</hi> there is expreſs mention of an Idol called <hi>Jupiter Belus;</hi> yea, and probable it is, that with ſome reſpect to this Idol-god it was that <hi>Daniel</hi> was called <hi>Belteſhazzar,</hi> when he was brought a Captive into <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 1.7. becauſe of that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.8. <hi>But at the laſt</hi> Daniel <hi>came in before me, whoſe name was</hi> Belteſhazzar, <hi>according to the name of my God.</hi> Indeed of the other Idol <hi>Nebo,</hi> we find no mention elſewhere in the Scripture; but we find a City ſo called from one of their Idol-gods. See the Note, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.38. And many of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Princes and Nobles ſeem to have had their Names from this Idol <hi>Nebo,</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Naburadan, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bopolaſſar,</hi> and others: The word <hi>Nebo</hi> according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> imports <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;</hi> and therefore it is generally thought that this Idol was an Oracle amongſt them, to whom they reſorted for information concerning future things. As for that which is ſaid of theſe Idols, Bel <hi>boweth down,</hi> Nebo <hi>ſtoopeth,</hi> it is clearly a Prophecy of the ruine and deſtruction of theſe <hi>Chaldean</hi> Idols, when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be taken by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> ſome indeed would have theſe terms of bowing down, and ſtooping, only to imply that theſe Idols that had been ſo magnified and highly eſteemed, ſhould now decline and ſink in their Credit; and others, that they ſhould ſtoop to the Yoke of Captivity; but the following words do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that it is meant of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Souldiers beating them down, being made of Silver and Gold, that they might carry them away as a rich Booty. Indeed conſidering that this was ſpoken when <hi>Babylon</hi> and her Idols were yet in their height of Glory, it may well be, which ſome ſay, that theſe Expreſſions are uſed to imply that their downfal drew nigh, Bel <hi>boweth down,</hi> Nebo <hi>ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:42788:225"/>
as if he had ſaid, they are falling, they are falling, they begin to totter, and will not ſtand long; however it is certainly ſpoken in a way of deriſion, as importing that thoſe lofty Idols before whom the Heads and Knees of the proud <hi>Babylonians</hi> had ſo often bowed, ſhould now bow and fall down themſelves; <hi>their Idols were upon the beaſts and upon the cattel,</hi> that is, they were by the <hi>Perſians</hi> laid as ſo much luggage upon their beaſts, or tumbled into Waggons, that they might be carried as a rich prize into their own Country: <hi>your carriages were heavy loaden, they are a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the weary beaſt;</hi> This may be taken, as ſpoken, either to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> or to the Idols; as terming the carriages wherein they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, their carriages. However this is all ſpoken by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion; as if it had been ſaid; Surely theſe are weighty gods, the poor weary beaſts have much ado to carry them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>They ſtoop, they bow down together,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of the weary beaſt that carried the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Idols, to wit, that they fainted and ſunk under the weight of them; and ſo likewiſe the following words, <hi>they could not deliver the burden,</hi> which they would have to be all one as if it had been ſaid, The poor beaſts could not free themſelves from their burthen: Or, they could not carry the Idols to the place where they were to deliver up that their burden. But rather it is meant, either 1. of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that they ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hung the head, <hi>they could not deliver the burthen,</hi> that is, they could not ſave their Idols from being carried away, when they ſaw the <hi>Perſians</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their beaſts with them; Or rather, 2. Of the Idol-gods. For the firſt words, <hi>They ſtoop, they bow down together,</hi> are in effect no more but a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was ſaid in the beginning of the foregoing verſe, to wit, that both <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Nebo,</hi> and all the reſt of their Idols together with them, did <hi>ſtoop and bow down,</hi> that is, were broken down by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and carried away upon their beaſts. And accordingly they underſtand that which follows, <hi>they could not deliver the burden,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, they could not keep themſelves from being a burthen to the weary beaſts; Or rather, <hi>they could not deliver the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> wherewith the beaſts were laden, out of the hand of the enemy, that is, they could not deliver themſelves; <hi>but themſelves are gone into captivity;</hi> That is, even their Idol-gods; ſo far they were from delivering the People, that they themſelves, together with the People, were carried Captives. It is in the <hi>Hebrew, their Souls are gone into captivity,</hi> which is an Hebraiſm, intending no more than what is ſaid in our Tranſlation, <hi>themſelves are gone into captivity,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.18. where it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph, his Soul went into Iron.</hi> But yet others hold, that theſe Idols are termed the <hi>Babylonians Soul;</hi> becauſe they eſteemed them as their own Souls, accounting that their well-being, yea their very life depended upon them. And again others think, that this expreſſion is uſed ironically, by way of deriding theſe their dead gods, that had indeed neither Soul nor Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:42788:226"/>Ver. 3. <hi>Harken unto me, O houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>and all the remnant of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c.] That is, all that were left of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after Ten of the Tribes were carried away captives into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and after the great havock that ſhould be made amongſt the other two Tribes by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.22. and 28.5. yet ſome by <hi>the remnant of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, underſtand thoſe few of the Ten Tribes that had hitherto joyned themſelves to the people of <hi>Judah.</hi> However that whereto he invites them to hearken, is that which he meant to ſay concerning himſelf, and the vanity of all Idol-gods, that ſo they might learn to truſt in him, and to take heed of idolatry. As for that which followeth, <hi>which are born by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb.</hi> That is, who from your very infancy, (See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.11.) or from the days of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (the firſt Original of your being my People) I have by my providence ſupported, and tenderly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fed and preſerved, even as a Mother that carries her Child up and down in her boſome, and in her arms. See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.31. This ſeems purpoſely added, the better to ſet forth the difference that was betwixt him, the true God, and the Idol-gods of the Heathens: They carried their gods upon beaſts, and carts, and waggons, whereas he on the other ſide did bear his People in his arms, as a Mother doth her young Infant.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And even to your old age I am he, and even to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar hairs will I carry you,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, And ſo I ſhall do more for you, than Mothers do for their young babes; As ſoon as they are grown up a little, they are left to go by themſelves, and are carried no longer: But I will be the ſame to you, even to your old age, that I have hitherto been. <hi>I have made,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.1. (And herein there is another difference hinted, betwixt him, the true God, that made his People, and the Idol-gods that were made by thoſe that worſhipped them) <hi>and I will bear, even I will carry:</hi> See the foregoing Note, <hi>and will deliver you;</hi> to wit, out of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>To whom will ye liken me?</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>They laviſh Gold out of the bag, and weigh Silver in the balance,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, to make ſure, that there was as much Silver put into their Idol as they allowed for it. Now all this is thus ſet forth, to ſhew how unfit theſe Idols were to be likened to the true and living God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>They bear him upon the ſhoulder, they carry him,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Having gotten him upon their ſhoulders, then they carry him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Remember this,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were too much addicted to idolatry, both in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and before they came thither: And ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.21. <hi>and ſhew your ſelves men,</hi> that is, make uſe of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42788:226"/>
and the covenant of your God, call to mind again and again, and meditate ſeriouſly of what I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Remember the former things of old,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, All the glorious Works of God from the Creation unto this time, his Predictions and Works, how he hath ſtill done what he hath foretold. And indeed, becauſe he ſpeaks here to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it muſt be underſtood eſpecially of all the great things he had done for them in former Ages.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Declaring the end from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, foretelling things to come from the firſt to the laſt, <hi>and from ancient times the things that are not yet done;</hi> which is an Argument often before uſed to prove, that the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hath done this, is the only true God: See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.22. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.9. and 43.9. and 44.8. and 45.21. <hi>Saying, My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure;</hi> and therefore what is not yet come to paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall as certainly come to paſs, as thoſe things that have come to paſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Calling a ravenous bird from the eaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.2.) ſhould come ſwiftly upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> overcoming all difficulties lying in his way, as if he flew over them, and ſhould tare their ſtate and people in pieces, as ſuch a bird doth her prey: For ſo it is expounded in the following words, <hi>the man that executeth my counſel from a far Country,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.28.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Hearken unto me, ye ſtout-hearted,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think this is ſpoken to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that out of the pride of their hearts, and ſtoutneſs of their ſtomachs, thought to carry all as they pleaſed themſelves, contrary to God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and purpoſes. But by the general current of Expoſitors, it is taken as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as was that before, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and that they are called <hi>ſtout-hearted,</hi> becauſe they had carried themſelves ſtoutly and ſtubbornly againſt God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the warnings he had given them by his Prophet, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Judgment that lay upon them in their being Captives in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and in the next words, <hi>far from righteouſneſs,</hi> either becauſe they were far from the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs which God required in his people (and haply with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their being much corrupted with the Religion and Manners of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> amongſt whom they lived), and therefore were very unfit for the deliverance they deſired. Or elſe, as ſome think, becauſe they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as in a deſperate condition, and far from ſeeing the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God made good to them by the performance of his promiſe concerning their deliverance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>I bring near my righteouſneſs: it ſhall not be far off,</hi> &amp;c.] They that underſtand the foregoing verſe, as ſpoken to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> do accordingly underſtand theſe words thus; That though they had been far from dealing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42788:227"/>
with his People, yet he would deal juſtly with them, in bringing ſpeedily that vengeance upon them, which by their cruel uſage of his people, they had juſtly deſerved. But taking the foregoing verſe, as ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which by this, that is here added, ſeems far moſt probable) this is all one in effect, as if the Lord had ſaid to them, Though you by your wickedneſs and infidelity do what you can to hinder me from doing it, yet I will approve my ſelf righteous by performing that which I have promiſed concerning your deliverance by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that ſpeedily, and without delay: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.8. which fully agrees with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>What if ſome did not believe? ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid,</hi> Rom. 3.3, 4. And this doth the rather appear to be the meaning of the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the following words, <hi>and my Salvation ſhall not tarry,</hi> to wit, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of my People out of their Captivity; <hi>and I will place Salvation in</hi> Zion, that is, having reſcued them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I will ſettle them again in <hi>Zion,</hi> as in a place of ſafety, <hi>for</hi> Iſrael <hi>my glory,</hi> that is, by whoſe deliverance I will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>COme down and ſit in the duſt, O Virgin Daughter of</hi> Babylon; <hi>ſit on the ground,</hi> &amp;c. What is meant by the <hi>Virgin Daughter of</hi> Babylon, and why ſhe may be here ſo called, See the Notes, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.12. God by the Prophet doth here ſpeak to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as to ſome proud ſtately young Queen gorgeouſly attired, and ſitting upon her Throne, and bids her <hi>come down and ſit in the duſt,</hi> and <hi>on the ground,</hi> to wit, as poor Slaves and Captives uſed to do, and others in times of great and ſolemn mourning; See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 2.8. and that which was intended hereby is, that this glorious Imperial City, that had ruled over ſo many Kingdoms and Nations, ſhould be forthwith brought down to the loweſt pitch of baſeneſs and miſery. And indeed Gods Command is enough to make ſuch mighty changes in Kingdoms: <hi>there is no Throne, O Daughter of the</hi> Caldeans: that is, thou ſhalt never Lord it more over other Nations, as thou haſt done; thy Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ſhall now be tranſlated to the <hi>Preſians; for thou ſhalt no more be called tender end delicate,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt no more be applauded for thine excellent great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or, thou ſhalt no longer live in ſuch tenderneſs and delicacy, but ſhalt be brought into a ſad and miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:42788:227"/>Ver. 2. <hi>Take the Milſtones and grind Meal,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, prepare thy ſelf for the baſeſt of all ſervile employments, ſuch as was grinding at the Mill, wherein they employed their Captives and pooreſt drudges. See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.5. and 12.29. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.21. and <hi>Job</hi> 31.10. As for that which followeth, <hi>Unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, paſs over the rivers;</hi> ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the firſt words, <hi>uncover thy locks,</hi> of the cuſtome of Womens going in their Mourning, with their Hair hanging looſe about them; and becauſe of that mention that is made in the laſt place of paſſing <hi>over, the River,</hi> that which is ſaid of uncovering their Legs and Thighs, they underſtand of taking up of their clothes, when they were to wade through deep Waters: But I rather take this whole paſſage to be a deſcription of the ſad plight wherein the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be, namely, that their ſtately Dames being ſtripped of their bravery, ſhould be carried away captives with their Hair hanging about their Ears, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only ſuch poor tattered Garments upon them as would neither cover their Legs or Thighs: (See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.2, 4.) And ſo ſhould be driven away into <hi>Perſia,</hi> wading through the Rivers as they went along.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Thy nakedneſs ſhall be uncovered; yea, thy ſhame ſhall be ſeen,</hi> &amp;c.) To wit, the nakedneſs of their Privy parts, which Women out of modeſty are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to have ſeen. <hi>I will take vengeance,</hi> as if he had ſaid, it is not ſo much <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that ſhall bring this miſery upon thee, as I the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſhall by this means take vengeance on thee for all the wickedneſs thou haſt committed againſt me, and againſt my people. <hi>And I will not meet thee as a man,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, I will fall upon thee without any pity or compaſſion, which even barbarous enemies will ſometimes ſhew to the conquered, eſpecially to the weaker Sex; and therefore as a Lion, or ſome other ravening Beaſt, rather than as a Man; or elſe, not with the wrath and power of Man, which may be reſiſted and born, but with the unreſiſtable and unſufferable power of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighry God. It is as if he had ſaid, whilſt thou hadſt to do with men, thou wert able to grapple with them, and uſually to ſubdue them; but now God will contend with thee, before whoſe indignation and revenging hand thou wilt never be able to ſtand. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.6. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>As for our Redeemer, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, the Holy one of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael].</hi> This is inſerted by the Prophet in the Name of God's people, as taking occaſion from that which had been ſaid concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> to break forth into this magnifying of God, by profeſſing that it was their God, the great God of Heaven and Earth that would do this, and that he would do it purpoſely for their ſakes, that they might be redeemed out of their Captivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Sit thou ſilent,</hi> &amp;c.] Here again God proceeds to ſet forth the miſery of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in their Captivity. <hi>Sit thou ſilent, and get thee into darkneſs, O daughter of the Caldeans;</hi> ſome think that by theſe words, get <hi>thee into darkneſs,</hi> is intended, that they ſhould be caſt into dark Priſons; or that after they were carried away Captives, they ſhould abide in the darkneſs of continual miſery: But it is more probable, that all the expreſſions here uſed, are to ſet forth how they ſhould be overwhelmed with grief and ſhame; for men in ſuch a condition are wont to ſit ſilent, (ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 2.13.) and to get into dark corners, as being aſhamed to be ſeen. And it may well be, which ſome think, that in
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42788:228"/>
that which is ſaid of their ſitting ſilent, there might be ſome reſpect had to the great noiſe which that Empire had formerly made in the world; as if he had ſaid, Thou that hadſt wont to thunder out thy commands and threatnings through ſo many Kingdoms, ſhalt now ſit ſilent, as being aſhamed of the baſe condition whereinto thou art fallen, and not daring to mutter againſt thoſe that ſhall tyrannize over thee.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I was wroth with my people,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the cauſe is ſhewn why <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſhould be thus deſtroyed: <hi>I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and given them into thine hand:</hi> That is, my people, whom I choſe to be my peculiar inheritance (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.15.) I have caſt off, as an unclean thing, as if they had been never ſeparated from others to be a holy people unto my ſelf, and as a People that had by their wickedneſs made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfit indeed to be my people, and delivered them up into thine hands, an unclean, uncircumciſed people, that thou mighteſt carry them out of my Land, whitherſoever thou pleaſedſt; (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.28.) <hi>Thou didſt ſhew them no mercy: upon the ancient haſt thou very heavily laid thy yoke:</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof, ſee <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.11, 12. The drift therefore of theſe words is clear, namely, to ſhew, that though he was willing that his people ſhould ſmart for their ſins, yet he was highly offended with their cruel uſage of them: Yea, and this alſo is hinted, that if God ſpared not his own people when they ſinned againſt him, much leſs would he ſpare them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And thou ſaidſt, I ſhall be a Lady for ever,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of <hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction, to wit, her ſecurity and preſumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence concerning the perpetuity of her greatneſs, and which was indeed the root of her pride and cruelty: <hi>So that thou didſt not lay theſe things to thy heart;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, That <hi>Iſrael</hi> was my peculiar people; and that therefore, though I made uſe of thee to correct them for their ſins, yet there was no likelihood that I would caſt them off for ever, and conſequently thou didſt not lay to heart the cruelties thou didſt exerciſe towards them. But rather, the things they did not lay to heart, were the things which were now foretold them, thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſeries which their inhumane dealing with Gods people would at laſt bring upon them; which is further confirmed from the laſt clauſe, <hi>neither didſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the latter end of it,</hi> That is, what would at length befal thee for thy cruelty to them: yet ſome underſtand this too, of the end of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the people of God, namely, that they did not bethink themſelves that God would at laſt deliver his people.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleaſures, that dwelleſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, without fear of any change, ſee the Note, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.7. <hi>that ſayeſt in thine heart, I am,</hi> to wit, the great Monarch and Empreſs of the world, <hi>and none elſe beſides me,</hi> that is, there is no Kingdom like me, either for magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or ſure ſtability; all other are not worth the naming, and are as nothing in compariſon of mine. An arrogant and blaſphemous expreſſion, wherein ſhe aſcribes that to her ſelf, which God often mentions as his tranſcendent peculiar dignity. <hi>I ſhall not ſit as a Widow, neither ſhall I know the loſs of Children;</hi> that is, I ſhall not ſit deſolate as a Widow, nor want of the Royal iſſue to ſit upon the Throne: Or, I ſhall never want a King that ſhall be as a Husband to me, nor be
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42788:228"/>
deprived of that numerous people, which, as my Children, live in ſubjection to me. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>But theſe two things ſhall come to thee in a moment, in one day,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in that day when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was done ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly, that there was no place for counſel or eſcape. <hi>The loſs of Children and Widowhood,</hi> that is, the deſtruction of thy people, and thy King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> amongſt the reſt, See <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.30. See the feregoing Note, <hi>They ſhall come upon thee in their perfection;</hi> that is, both the one and the other ſhall be fully and to the utmoſt accompliſhed upon thee, even to the utter deſtruction of thy Kingdom; <hi>for the multitude of thy ſorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments;</hi> that is, for all thy magical arts and practices, wherein the <hi>Caldeans</hi> did abound: So that this is mentioned as another cauſe of their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For thou haſt truſted in thy wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, either their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed policies, their rapines and oppreſſions, and all other the wicked ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had raiſed themſelves to their preſent greatneſs, and whereby they might ſtill hope to ſecure themſelves againſt all fears and dangers. Or 2ly, the riches and power which they had gotten by ſuch ways of wickedneſs. Or 3dly, all their Magick Arts (mentioned in the cloſe of the foregoing Verſe, and much afterward inſiſted on) whereon they relied much, becauſe they thought their Magicians able to foreſee and foretel future things, and heard nothing but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of good from them; and likewiſe able by their Sorceries and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts to help them, and prejudice their enemies. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, none ſeeth me;</hi> That is, thou haſt flattered thy ſelf, as if neither God nor Man could take notice of thy ſinful ways and policies. See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.15. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thy wiſdom and thy knowledg it hath perverted thee;</hi> That is, thy truſting to that which thou eſteemeſt great wiſdom and knowledg, thy carnal policy, or thy great skill in Magick Arts, hath deceived thee and miſlead thee, emboldening thee in thy hardneſs, and cauſing thee to chucker thy ſelf with groundleſs hopes; <hi>and thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I am, and none elſe beſides me;</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. So that all things conſidered, the drift of this Verſe ſeems to be, to ſhew what was the Root and Spring of that pride and ſecurity in the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. as the cauſe why God would deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Therefore ſhall evil come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it riſeth,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the <hi>Hebrew, Thou ſhalt not know the morning thereof;</hi> and therefore ſome take the meaning to be, either that they ſhould not know what day it ſhould come; or that they ſhould take no notice of the apparent ſigns of their approaching deſtruction; though there ſhould be many things that ſhould be as clear tokens of their approaching ruine, as the firſt dawning of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a token that the Sun is about to riſe; yet they ſhould never obſerve them. And becauſe the words may be rendered, <hi>Thou ſhalt not know the riſing thereof,</hi> it may be the more probably thought, that there is a ſecret nip here given to the practice of their Magicians and Aſtronomers, on whom they ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, who in their Figure-caſting, were wont ſtudiouſly to obſerve the riſing and aſpect of the Planets; as if it had been ſaid, you that by the riſing of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, pretend or foretel what all days will prove, whether fatal or proſperous, ſhall not be able to foreſee the riſing or the morning of the day of your own
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42788:229"/>
deſtruction. And again it may be ſpoken with reference to the ſudden ſurpriſal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that was taken before the Inhabitants began to fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger, as all Hiſtories reports. But becauſe our Tranſlators have rendred the word, <hi>thou ſhalt not know from whence it riſeth,</hi> it is clear that they underſtand it of their not knowing from what Nation or Countrey their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould come upon them, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> not dreaming at that time of any quarrel or evil intention that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had againſt them: <hi>And miſchief ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off; and deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, which thou ſhalt not know:</hi> That is, which thou ſhalt not foreſee, and ſo it will be the more grievous to be born.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein thou haſt laboured from thy youth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, whereto thou haſt been violently addicted, and which thou haſt followed with all eagerneſs, even from the firſt raiſing of thy City and State. And indeed this people were of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time much given to theſe ſinful practices; in ſo much, that the profeſſors of theſe Arts were among other Nations known and called by the Name of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans. Stand now with thine inchantments,</hi> &amp;c. This is ſpoken by way of deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by way of inſulting over them for their vain confidence in thoſe things; as if it had been ſaid, Call your Magicians together, and try what good you can do with them; <hi>if ſo be thou ſhalt be able to profit, if ſo be thou maiſt prevail;</hi> That is, ſee whether this will any way advantage thee; whether hereby thou canſt keep off the ruine that is coming upon thee; and then you will ſoon find, that ſuch things will do you no good in the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy Counſels,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Thou doſt but tire thy ſelf in vain, in ſeeking out many and many ſeveral ways to ſave thy ſelf: Or, having hitherto to no purpooſe wearied thy ſelf in thoſe manifold policies and ways, whereby thou haſt ſought to ſecure thy ſelf; try now what thy cunning wiſe men, thy Wizzards can do; as it follows in the next words, <hi>Let now the Aſtrologers, the Star-gazers, the Monthly Prognoſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ators,</hi> that is, thoſe that undertake to foretel what will come to paſs every Month, <hi>ſtand up, and ſave thee from thoſe things that ſhall come upon thee;</hi> that is, let them ſtand up like men, and make uſe of all their Art, to ſee if they can foretel the miſeries that are coming upon thee, and ſave thee from them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Behold, they ſhall be as Stubble,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.7. <hi>The fire ſhall burn them,</hi> which is meant of the invaſion of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and it may be alſo ſpoken with relation to their burning of <hi>Babylon; they ſhall not deliver themſelves from the power of the flame,</hi> to wit, your Aſtronomers and Star-gazers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how then ſhall they be able to deliver you? So that indeed your truſt in them, is as if by heaping Stubble about you, you ſhould hope to keep your ſelves from burning; <hi>There ſhall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to ſit before it,</hi> That is, they ſhall be utterly deſtroyed and conſumed, as where Srub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is burnt, where there is not ſo much as a brand or coal to be found, nothing at all but Aſhes, good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Thus ſhall they be unto thee with whom thou haſt laboured,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thus unable to help thee ſhall they all be, with whom thou haſt tired thy ſelf, in conſulting with them concerning thine Eſtate. And commonly it is held, that this
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42788:229"/>
is meant of their Magicians and Diviners, of whom he had been before ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yea, of the ſame they hold the following words are ſpoken, <hi>even thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants from thy youth,</hi> &amp;c. and that they are called <hi>Merchants,</hi> becauſe (as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants) they had many crafty ways to deceive thoſe they traded with, and made the people pay dearly for what they did for them. But yet others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole Verſe, of the Merchants that from foreign parts traded in <hi>Babylon</hi> in great multitudes, by reaſon of her convenient ſituation for Trade, in regard of her many great Rivers that ran into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea; as if it had been expreſſed thus, As it ſhall be with thee in regard of thy Wizzards, ſo alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thy Merchants, with whom thou haſt traded <hi>from thy youth,</hi> (See the Note above, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. <hi>They ſhall wander every one to his quarter,</hi> That is, they ſhall get away, fleeing every one to his own Country and home; or, they ſhall flee ſome one way, and ſome another, wandring up and down, each one in the way wherein he hopes to find a free paſſage; <hi>None ſhall ſave thee,</hi> to wit, neither. Wizzards, nor Merchants.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLVIII.</head>
               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>HEar ye this,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing Chapters foretold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deliverance of his people from thence; leſt this ſhould make his people think highly of themſelves, here the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth his ſpeech to them, convincing them of their groſs hypocriſie and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and that their deliverance would be meerly of God's free grace, <hi>Hear ye this, O Houſe of Jacob, which art called by the Name of Iſrael,</hi> That is, that are called <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and glory much therein, though you be not ſo indeed; <hi>and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,</hi> That is, that are the off-ſpring of <hi>Judah,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Jews,</hi> deſcending from his Stock, as ſtreams of water from their Spring; See the Notes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. And this is mentioned as another thing wherein they gloried much, becauſe this was the royal Tribe, that had retained the worſhip of God with them, when the other Tribes fell away to Idolatry: <hi>which ſwear by the name of the Lord,</hi> to wit, as owning him to be the only true God, <hi>and make mention of the God of Iſrael,</hi> to wit, in ſwearing by him; or more generally, in that they talked much of God, and gloried in him as their God peculiarly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. <hi>But not in truth nor in righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, not ſincerely, but hypocritically.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For they call themſelves of the holy City,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they boaſt that they are Citizens of the Holy City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in regard of Gods dwelling there amongſt them, and their worſhipping him there, and the confidence they had, that upon this account God would certainly defend the City; <hi>and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael;</hi> that is, they profeſs much confidence in God, and make a great ſhew of relying upon him, though indeed there is no ſuch thing. <hi>The Lord of hoſts is his name,</hi> which is added, not to imply that God, Almighty Al-ruling power was the ground why they did with ſuch confidence rely upon him;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42788:230"/>
but rather how able he was every moment to deſtroy them that did thus groſly diſſemble with him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I have declared the former things from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, from the time when I firſt took you to be my people, I have ſucceſſively in former Ages foretold you future things: <hi>and they went out of my mouth, and I ſhewed them,</hi> That is, I determined on the things to be done, and then revealed them by my Prophets to you. <hi>I did them ſuddenly, and they came to paſs:</hi> That is, when the time determined came, they were ſuddenly done: when they, concerning whom they were foretold, did little think of any ſuch thing. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.9. All which is alledged, as often formerly (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 46.10.) to make it clear to them, that hereby he had ſufficiently approved himſelf to them to be the only true God. And what his aim was in aſſerting this here; is ſet forth in the following Verſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Becauſe I knew that thou art obſtinate, and thy neck is an iron ſinew, and thy brow braſs)</hi> Here the reaſon is given, why he had, by foretelling things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did them, prov'd himſelf to be the only true God (as is ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſe, and repeated again in that which follows) namely, becauſe he knew that they were a ſtubborn, ſtiff-necked, impudent people, that would hardly be brought to believe his words by his Prophets, and very prone to rebel againſt him; and ſo to prevent this (and that meerly of his own free grace, notwithſtanding this their wickedneſs) he had thus clearly manifeſted himſelf to them, even from their firſt being his people, unto that preſent time, when he had foretold them their captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and their deliverance from thence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to paſs I ſhewed it thee,</hi> &amp;c.] See the two foregoing Notes, <hi>leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, mine Idol hath done them,</hi> &amp;c. And this is mentioned as one of the main effects of their ſtubborneſs, which God ſought to prevent by foretelling before-hand what he meant to do in future times, namely, their aſcribing the great things which he did to their Idol-gods.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Thou haſt heard, ſee all this,</hi> &amp;c.) That is, you have heard how in all Ages I have foretold what ſhould come to paſs in future times, and how all things have exactly come to paſs as they were foretold; now mark and conſider all this, and lay it ſeriouſly to heart: <hi>And will not ye declare it?</hi> That is, will ye not declare unto others this which you have heard concerning my Predictions and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of them, and ſo bear witneſs to the truth, that it may be ſeen that I have omitted no neceſſary means of manifeſting my ſelf to you? <hi>I have ſhewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didſt not know them:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, As formerly, ſo now alſo I have foretold thee new things, which were wholly hidden, and which of thy ſelf thou couldeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have known, to wit, the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thy deliverance from thence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>They are created now, and not from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they are now revealed and brought to light (as things are when created) and not in former times, ſee the Notes, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3, 5. <hi>Even before the day when thou heardeſt them not,</hi> That is, before the time when thou hadſt heard any thing of them;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42788:230"/>
                  <hi>leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, behold, I knew them,</hi> that is, leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, when they came to paſs, I knew well enough that theſe things would be.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Yea, thou heardest not,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have the meaning of this whole Verſe to be, that God had revealed theſe new things to them, of which mention was made in the forgoing Verſe, to wit, the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deliverance of his people, when they <hi>heard not,</hi> &amp;c. when they obſtinately ſtopped their ears, and would not hear what he ſaid to them. But it is rather a continuation of what he had ſaid before; <hi>yea, thou heardeſt not,</hi> that is, the things that I now reveal to thee, are things which thou hadſt never heard before from thy Star-gazers, or Soothſayers, or any body elſe; <hi>yea, thou kneweſt not,</hi> That is, thou kneweſt them not any other way: <hi>Yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened,</hi> That is, even when the leaſt of this buſineſs had never yet come to thine ear: <hi>for I knew that thou wouldeſt deal very treacherouſly.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Therefore do I repeat this, and preſs this ſo often upon thee, that it is I that have foretold thee theſe future things that ſhall befall thee, to make ſure thou ſhouldeſt know, that it was I that cauſed thee to be carried away into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that it was I that delivered thee from thence; and that becauſe I knew that thou wouldeſt not own mine hand in all that befel thee, but wouldeſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſcribe it to other things: <hi>And waſt called a tranſgreſſor from the womb,</hi> That is, that haſt been a tranſgreſſor from the womb, to wit, ſay ſome, from thy Nativity, or from thy firſt coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when God firſt took thee upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to be his covenant-people (but ſee alſo the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 46.3.) and therefore mayeſt deſervedly be ſo called, rather than as it is ſaid, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. they were commonly called <hi>by the name of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>For my names ſake will I defer mine anger,</hi> &amp;c.) As if God ſaid, though thou art, and haſt always been ſo wicked, as is before ſaid, yet will I ſtay and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mine anger <hi>for my names ſake,</hi> That is, ſay ſome, becauſe thou art called by my name, as being accounted my people: Or rather for mine own ſake, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. That is, with reſpect to mine own glory. It was not becauſe you deſerved not to be deſtroyed, but that men might not queſtion mine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and faithfulneſs towards my people; or ſay the gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were mightier than I. See the Note alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.20. <hi>And for my praiſe will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off;</hi> That is, I will for thy good withhold my ſelf from deſtroying thee, that I may be praiſed for my mercy and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee. All which is inſerted for the comfort of the faithful amongſt Gods people; and that when they were delivered, they might aſcribe it wholly to Gods free Grace.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Behold, I have refined thee,</hi> &amp;c.] As if the Lord had ſaid, Though with reſpect to mine own Glory I would not utterly deſtroy thee (as was ſaid in the forgoing Verſe) yet with reſpect to thy good, I have ſought to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy Droſs in the fire of Affliction. The greateſt difficulty is in the following words; which ſome read, as they are in the Margin, <hi>I have refined thee, but not for ſilver,</hi> and ſo underſtand it, that it was not for any gain or advantage that God got by it, that he caſt them into the furnace of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and indeed we have the like expreſſions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.13. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.12. for which ſee the Notes there. But by moſt interpreters the words are rendered, as in our Tranſlation, <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42788:231"/>
thee, but not with ſilver;</hi> which though ſome underſtand of the ſucceſleſneſs of Gods afflicting them, to wit, that though he had ſought to refine them in the furnace of affliction, yet it had not been with them, as it is with Silver, which is purged from its droſs in the Refiners furnace; they being ſtill as wicked as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet the moſt and beſt Expoſitors underſtand it of the gentelneſs of Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting them, <hi>I have refined thee, but not with ſilver;</hi> that is, not with ſo hot, and fierce, and vehement a Fire, as the Refiners uſe in refining their Silver: I have afflicted thee but lightly and moderately, having reſpect to thine infirmity, rather than to the greatneſs of thy ſin and ſtubbornneſs; I have not refined ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and exactly, as Refiners do their Silver, who keep it in the Fire, till all the Droſs be waſted and purged out of it; for then they would have been quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. <hi>I have choſen thee in the furnace of affliction,</hi> That is, ſay ſome, I will make a choice one of thee, by purging thee; or I have purged thee, like choice Silver, in the Furnace of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But rather I conceive the meaning is, either that God had choſen their captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> to be as a Refining Furnace to them; or elſe, that in this their affliction he had ſet his heart upon them, and had choſen and called them out, as we do things we mean to preſerve to be delivered.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>All ye aſſembler your ſelves and hear,</hi> &amp;c] That is, as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1 and 11. All ye my people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> conſidering I am ſo great a God (as was ſaid in the foregoing verſe) hearken diligently to what I ſay; ſome would have it that the Prophet ſpeaks here in his own perſon, becauſe of thoſe words in this <hi>verſe, the Lord loved him.</hi> But nothing is more uſual than for God to ſpeak of himſelf in the third perſon; It is therefore more probable, that as before, and after, ſo here alſo, the Prophet ſpeaks in the name of God; <hi>which among them have declared theſe things?</hi> that is, which of the Idol gods (ſee the Note before, <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.) their Diviners or Aſtrologers, have foretold theſe things that I have foretold? See the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.7. and 45.21. <hi>The Lord hath loved</hi> him, that is, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> named before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.1. to wit, in that he exalted him ſo highly,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:42788:231"/>
and made uſe of him in ſo great a Service: <hi>He will do his pleaſure on Babylon.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap</hi> 44.28. <hi>and his arm ſhall be on the Caldeans,</hi> that is, he ſhall fall heavily on them, and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>I, even I, have ſpoken,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I, even I alone, who am a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, and ſure to perform what I ſay: <hi>yea, I have called him,</hi> to wit <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (as before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. to the doing of that great work, whereunto I have appointed him; <hi>I have brought him,</hi> that is, I will bring him; <hi>and he ſhall make his way proſperous,</hi> that is, he ſhall proſper in whatever he undertakes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this,</hi> &amp;c.] ſee the Note before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret from the beginning,</hi> the meaning whereof muſt needs be this (if we take them to be the words of the Prophet, as many do, and as the laſt words in this Verſe clearly are) that from the beginning of Gods calling him to his Prophetical Office, he had publickly and plainly made known to them what God had reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; and accordingly the following words muſt alſo be underſtood, <hi>from the time that it was, there am I;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, from the time that any thing was revealed to me, there ſtill am I (as in my watch-tower) faithfully and plainly declaring the whole will of God unto his People. But this Expoſition is ſomewhat hard; rather therefore it is God that ſpeaks here to his People, <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret from the beginning,</hi> that is, from the firſt time that I took you to be my people, or from the time that I firſt began to foretel you future things by my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, I have always made known ſuch things to you clearly and in publick: ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.19. And then agreeably hereto, muſt the following words be underſtood, <hi>from the time that it was, I am there;</hi> namely, either 1. that from the time that any thing was foretold by his Prophets, he was there revealing to them, by his ſpirit; the things which they did foretel; ſo that it was he indeed that ſpake by them. Or 2. That from the time that any thing came to paſs which was foretold, he was there accompliſhing the things foretold, by his Almighty power; as they were foretold, ſo they were alſo accompliſhed by him. And then for the laſt clauſe there, as is ſaid before, it is clear that the Prophet ſpeaks in his own perſon; <hi>and now the Lord God and his Spirit hath ſent me,</hi> that is, as formerly in other things foretold by me and other the Prophets of God; ſo now in this which I ſay concerning <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I ſay nothing but by commiſſion from God, and by the inſpiration of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit;</hi> that is, who teacheth thee by my Word and Spirit, thoſe things which will be for thy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; <hi>which leadeth thee by the way that thou ſhouldeſt go;</hi> that is, teaching and directing thee how to order thy converſation. And the aim of theſe words, I conceive, is this; leſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould ſay, If the Lord meant to fetch us back out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> why did he bring us hither? Therefore the Lord tells them here, that he had done enough to make them a Righteous people, which had they improved for good, they might have been ſtill in their own Land.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my Commandments,</hi> &amp;c.] Implying, that then they had been free from all thoſe miſeries, which by their diſobeying Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they had brought upon themſelves, &amp; particularly in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſee the foregoing Note: <hi>then had thy peace been as a river,</hi> that is, then had thy peace
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42788:232"/>
or thy proſperity in every regard (See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165.) been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a continued courſe, exceeding great, over-bearing any thing that might in likelihood be any hinderance to it: And to the ſame purpoſe is the following clauſe, <hi>and thy righteouſneſs as the Waves of the Sea;</hi> for by <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> here, is meant, either the reward of Righteouſneſs, namely, Peace and Proſperity, as before (as iniquity is ſometimes put for the reward of iniquity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13.) See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.17. Or more particularly, a State rightly and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and eſtabliſhed; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Thy ſeed alſo had been as the Sand, and the Off-ſpring of thy Bowels like the Gravel thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Whereas your number hath been of late much diminiſhed, by the breaking in pieces of ten of your Tribes, and the carrying of them away into Captivity, and by the havock alſo that your enemies have made, even amongſt you of <hi>Judah,</hi> had you been Obedient to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, it would have been quite contrary with you; God would have exceedingly multiplied you according to his promiſe of old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. <hi>His Name ſhould not have been cut off, nor deſtroyed from before me;</hi> that is, my people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their State and Commonwealth, and ſo their name and memory, and the great renown which formerly they enjoyed, ſhould not have been cut off from the Land, where in the Temple I dwelt amongſt them, as now it is like to be, to wit, in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Go ye forth,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing verſes told them, that they by their ſins had been the cauſe of the miſeries that were come upon them, here he adds, that yet notwithſtanding, to wit, of his own free grace, and for his own name-ſake, as he had ſaid before, he would deliver them out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And this he ſpeaks of, as if it were then a doing (though it were not to be done till about a hundred years after) to make the tidings thereof the more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, and the better to aſſure them of the certainty of it, <hi>Go ye forth of Babylon; flee ye from the Caldeans,</hi> to wit, that ye may not be deſtroyed with them. Some indeed conceive, that in theſe laſt words the <hi>Jews</hi> are adviſed, upon the firſt report of the approach of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to get them away from amongſt the <hi>Caldeans;</hi> but the following words do rather import a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture with full and free Liberty upon the proclamation of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> than an eſcape by flight; <hi>with a voice of ſinging declare ye;</hi> that is, with great joy declare what God hath done for you; and therefore it is repeated again and again, as a matter of great joy, <hi>tell this, utter it even to the end of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſpread it abroad, ſo that the ſame may be carried to the ends of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And they thirſted not when he led them through the Deſarts,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, Though in this return of my People from <hi>Babylon</hi> to their own Countrey, they went through many wild and dry deſarts, yet they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing that was neceſſary for them, I provided for them as I did for their Anceſtors, when I carried them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilderneſs into the Land of <hi>Canaan; He cauſed the waters to flow out of the Rock for them,</hi> &amp;c. that is, he did in a wonderful manner provide for them, as once for their Anceſtors in their paſſage to the Promiſed Land, ſee the notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.18. and 43.19. But yet, though this be thus expreſſed as done already, to imply the certainty of it; yet; that I conceive which the Prophet intended, was, that thus it ſhould be when they were delivered out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:42788:232"/>Ver. 22. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith the Lord, unto the wicked.]</hi> Having before told them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. That if they would have obeyed Gods Commandments, their peace ſhould have been always abundantly great; here he aſſures them, that it is never ſo with wicked men. But the drift of the Prophet in cloſing this Prophecy with this general Propoſition, may ſeem to be, to imply, either, 1. that whilſt God ſhewed ſo much Mercy and Goodneſs to his people, yet it ſhould be quite otherwiſe with the wicked <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they ſhould certainly be deſtroyed; and therefore it would be wiſdom in the <hi>Jews</hi> to haſte out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Or 2ly. that though the <hi>Jews</hi> might have been in a moſt proſperous eſtate, had they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed Gods Commandments (as was ſaid before, <hi>Verſe</hi> 18, 19.) yet it was no wonder that it was ſo ill with them at preſent, becauſe of their great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or 3dly. that in the foregoing promiſe, made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Peace ſpoken to the wicked amongſt them, but only to the godly; for though they might go out of <hi>Babylon</hi> together with others, yet this would not be done for them, becauſe God was reconciled to them, but ſtill they would lye under Gods wrath, becauſe of their wickedneſs.</p>

I do not ſee any inconvenience in that, which ſome learned Expoſitors hold; namely, that the Prophet ſpeaks here in his own perſon, and as before concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet as principally intending hereby to ſpeak in the name of Chriſt, of whom he was a Type, and to ſet forth the greater work of Redemption which was ſhadowed forth in the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that was to be accompliſhed by Chriſt. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the general current of Expoſitors do underſtand this as ſpoken by Chriſt alone, without reſpect to any other. Having (ſay they) hitherto ſpoken of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and his deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> here he ſpeaks of Chriſt and of our Redemption by him; and ſo on to the end of his Prophecy: whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they ſay it is, that whereas before the <hi>Jews</hi> only were ſpoken to, <hi>Hear ye this, O houſe of Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. here the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called upon to hear, <hi>Liſten, O Iſles unto me, and hearken ye people from far;</hi> becauſe the Goſpel of Chriſt was to be preached to them, even to to the utmoſt of them, and becauſe they would embrace Chriſt, when the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould reject him, and ſo ſhould be taken in to be Gods People, inſtead of the <hi>Jews.</hi> However, it is clear that Chriſt is here principally (if not ſolely) intended, becauſe many paſſages in this Chapter are in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> expreſly aſcribed to Chriſt, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 6, 8, and 10. And indeed, if we conſider that the People of God would have no well-grounded hope of that promiſed deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but by their recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God in and through the Mediation of Chriſt; it cannot ſeem ſtrange that from the prediction of the deliverance, he ſhould now proceed to this promiſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42788:233"/>
concerning Chriſt, <hi>The Lord hath called me from the Womb,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Even from the Womb he deſigned me to the Office of the Mediator; yet the meaning is not, that God did not appoint him thereto, till he was conceived or born (for he was by Gods decree choſen and ſeparated to be the Meſſiah from all Eternity) but that in his conception and birth, there was a tendency to the accompliſhment of this which God had decreed concerning him; to that end he was born. Thus it was with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in regard of his Prophetical Office (as it was with <hi>Jeremy</hi> alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. and with St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.15.) and thus it was with Chriſt; <hi>From the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of my Mother hath he made mention of my Name;</hi> that is, from my very birth, or before I was born, he aſſigned me my name, and did thereby make known the Work and Office whereunto I was appointed; ſee <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.31. and 2.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And he hath made my mouth like a ſharp ſword; in the ſhadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a poliſhed ſhaft; in his Quiver hath he hid me.]</hi> For the underſtanding of this, we muſt know, firſt, that Chriſts Word and Preaching, (and Typically the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> too) is here compared to a <hi>ſharp ſword,</hi> and to a <hi>Poliſhed ſhaft,</hi> (which wounds, not only near at hand, but alſo at a great diſtance, very far off) be cauſe it ſhould be of ſuch power and efficacy, to wound and pierce the hearts of Men, both by working effectually upon ſome for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and by convincing, vexing, and galling of others, yea, even of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the utmoſt parts of the World; the accompliſhment whereof we ſee in many things recorded in the Goſpel concerning Chriſts preaching; as where it is ſaid of Chriſt, that he was <hi>mighty in word, Luk.</hi> 24.19. and where his very enemies confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Never Man ſpake like this Man, Joh.</hi> 7.46. and in that which is ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. that it is <hi>quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged, ſword,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the Notes alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6.

And indeed, conſidering how ſharply <hi>Iſaiah</hi> dealt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that for ſo long a time together, under ſo many ſeveral Kings (as when he called them <hi>Princes of Sodom, and People of Gomorrah, Chap.</hi> 10. and ſo in many other places) he might well ſay that God had hid him in the ſhadow of his hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For otherwiſe how could he have been ſo long ſecured againſt their Rage and Fury?</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And ſaid unto me, Thou art my Servant, O Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] In our great Annotations, another Tranſlation is approved as beſt, <hi>And he ſaid, thou art my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, It is Iſrael in whom I will be glorified.</hi> But this cannot be the meaning of the words, according to our Tranſlation; of thoſe therefore that adhere to our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, ſome hold that this is ſpoken of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and that he is called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as owning him to be the only one, in a manner, amongſt his people, that in thoſe times of general defection deſerved to be called by that name, <hi>an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> is called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47. but far moſt generally it is underſtood of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art my Servant, O Iſrael;</hi> for <hi>Servant,</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1. The greater queſtion is, why Chriſt ſhould be here called <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Some ſay it is, becauſe he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42788:233"/>
was deſcended of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which is not improbable, it being manifeſt, that elſewhere in like manner he is called <hi>David, Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. Others, becauſe he was the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who wreſtled with God to pacifiy his wrath againſt poor ſinners, and prevailed, as <hi>Jacob</hi> once wreſtled with the Angel, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and was thereupon called <hi>Iſrael, Gen.</hi> 32.28. And others again, becauſe he was the <hi>Seed,</hi> to wit of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the promiſe is made, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. And ſo they hold, that both Chriſt as the Head, and the faithful as his Members, are here joyntly together called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as elſewhere Chriſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the whole Church, is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. But this ſeems not ſo probable, becauſe it is ſo clear in the foregoing Verſe, that one particular perſon is here ſpoken to. However the ground of the following words, <hi>In whom I will be glorified,</hi> (as they have reſpect to Chriſt) is clearly becauſe, 1. by his making God known, and the riches of his Grace towards poor ſinners; and 2ly, by his accompliſhing the great work of their Redemption, and triumphing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in over Satan, Death, and Hell: And 3dly. by his performing all that had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, God was exceedingly Glorified; whence was that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Then I ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Chriſt, (though indeed the following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint might well be <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> alſo, as a type of Chriſt) <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought and in vain,</hi> to wit, in regard I could prevail with ſo few of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to embrace the glad tidings of the Goſpel; ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.32. <hi>Yet ſurely my Judgement is with the Lord,</hi> that is, he it is that can and will judge my cauſe, and to him I willingly refer my ſelf; <hi>and my work with my God,</hi> that is, he knows the Commiſſion I had from him, and how faithfully I have diſcharged my truſt; labouring therein, even to the ſpending of my ſtrength; and therefore I know that he will reward me, not according to the ſucceſs of my Labours, but according to my faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of my duty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And now ſaith the Lord, that formed me from the Womb, to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that appointed and fitted me from the Womb to be his Servant, (and indeed then Chriſt took upon him the form of a ſervant) ſee the Notes above, Verſe 2, 3. <hi>to bring Jacob again to him,</hi> that is, to convert the <hi>Jews,</hi> to bring them by Faith and Repentance to return to the Lord their God, from whom they were ſtrayed; <hi>Though Iſrael be not gathered,</hi> &amp;c. Some read this as it is in the Margin, <hi>that Iſrael may be gathered to him, and I may be glorious,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo make it a farther declaration of Gods end in ſending Chriſt, namely, the gathering of the <hi>Jews</hi> in to God. But reading the words as they are in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord;</hi> the meaning is plain, as if he had ſaid, it would have been indeed a great glory to me, had I been the means of converting <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to that which the Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe that were converted by him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>ye are our glory and joy;</hi> and when God ſeems to curſe the labours of his Servants, by making them ineffectual for the good of a People, it is ſome kind of a diſhonour to thoſe his Servants; but yet though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be obſtinate, and will not be gathered in by me (according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a hen gathereth her Chickens, and ye would
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42788:234"/>
not?</hi>) yet will God highly eſteem of me, and of my labour in my Miniſtry; yea, and ſome think that under thoſe words, <hi>yet ſhall I be glorious,</hi> that glory may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be comprehended, where with God honoured him by his reſurrection, and the glory that followed thereupon, and by the bringing in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon the preaching of the Goſpel amongſt them; <hi>and my God ſhall be my ſtrength,</hi> to wit, 1. to ſupport and comfort me againſt the ingratitude and incredulity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom I am ſent. 2. To defend me from the rage of mine enemies. And 3. to inable me for the whole work that ſhall be impos'd on me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God ſaid, as before, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>It is a light thing, that thou ſhouldeſt be my Servant to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob;</hi> that is, (ſay ſome, that underſtand it of the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi>) to raiſe up the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is ruin'd and broken down, and to ſet them up again in their former State, in their own Countrey: Or, (as others ſay, that underſtand it of their ſpiritual converſion) to raiſe up the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that by their apoſtatiſing from God, is in a manner broken to pieces, and to make them again a holy people to the Lord their God: <hi>and to reſtore the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (or <hi>the deſolations) of Iſrael;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, to reſtore that little remnant that is left in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom God hath hitherto preſerved in the midſt of thoſe great deſolations that have been made amongſt them, and to bring them home again to their own Land. Or, as others, to bring home to God, that little remnant of his elect, whom God had in all ages preſerved for himſelf with ſpecial care, even as the apple of his own eye. <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be my Salvation unto the end of the Earth;</hi> that is, (ſay they that underſtand the foregoing words of the Prophets, foretelling the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his People) this mercy of the deliverance of my people ſhall not be the only effect of the ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even to many of the remote nations of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhall it bring great joy, becauſe even they ſhall thereby be delivered from that fear and Bondage they had formerly been in. But this expoſition is nothing ſo clear, as that which moſt follow, concerning Chriſts enlightning the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel to them, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.1, 2. and 4.26. for to this, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> applied theſe words, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 47. where they told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the rejecting the Goſpel, they would turn to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and gave this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; <hi>For ſo hath the Lord commanded us, ſaying, I have ſet thee to be a light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for ſalvation unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> And accordingly, I conceive, the words of the Prophet may be underſtood, as if he had ſaid, though it be a great matter that thou ſhouldeſt convert the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo raiſe up the tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which implies that ſome even amongſt them ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Chriſt; yet this is but a light and a ſmall matter in compariſon of that which thou ſhalt do, for by thee the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be enlightened, and be brought in to be one Church together with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and partake of the ſame common Salvation together with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord the redeemer of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.] to wit, that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten redeemed them out of many dangers and diſtreſſes; <hi>and his holy one;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. <hi>to him whom man deſpiſeth</hi> &amp;c. or as it is in the Margin, <hi>to him that is deſpiſed in Soul;</hi> that is, that is apprehenſive in his own Soul, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly he is ſcorned and deſpiſed, according to the complaint of the <hi>Jews</hi> in
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42788:234"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> (of whom ſome underſtand this place) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.4. <hi>Our Soul is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at caſe, and with the contempt of the proud.</hi> But the great queſtion is, Of whom, and to whom this is ſpoken. Some underſtand it of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, to him whom man deſpiſeth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, a ſervant of Rulers;</hi> and that, ſay they, becauſe he was deſpiſed and abhorred by the generality of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and uſed like ſome poor contemptible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by their Princes and Rulers, and that out of their rage againſt him for his bold and ſharp reproving their ſins. And indeed, I ſee not why this might not be ſpoken with reſpect to him, as he was a type of Chriſt; the greateſt difficulty is in applying the following words to him, <hi>Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip.</hi> But even that might be ſpoken with reſpect to that reverent eſteem they ſhould have of him, and the honour they ſhould do him, when they ſhould ſee many things come to paſs exactly as he had foretold them, as it was particularly in the caſe of <hi>Sennacharib.</hi> Again, others underſtand it of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe deliverance they ſay the Prophet here foretels, who were uſed there indeed as a moſt deſpicable and abominable people, and were perfect ſlaves to their great Lords, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they alſo underſtand the following words, <hi>Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip;</hi> to wit, that Kings ſhould take notice of the wonder of their deliverance, and upon the account thereof ſhould afford them much reſpect and honour (which they ſay was accompliſhed in the great reſpect they had from <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and others, after their return out of <hi>Babylon) becauſe of the Lord that is faithful, and the holy one of Iſrael; and he ſhall chooſe thee;</hi> becauſe they ſhould ſee the promiſes, that God had made to them, faithfully performed; the Lord thereby owning them, and appearing for them as his peculiar people. But queſtionleſs it is Chriſt that is here principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>to him whom man deſpiſeth,</hi> that is, whom every man in a manner deſpiſeth, as it is ſaid afterward again of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.3. <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> See the Notes alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6, 7. <hi>to him whom the Nation abhorreth,</hi> to wit, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as was moſt evident in their bitter proſecuting of Chriſt at his death; <hi>to a Servant of rulers,</hi> that is, Chriſt, whom the rulers uſed, as if he had been the baſeſt of Servants or Slaves; <hi>Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip,</hi> that is, even the great Kings of the Earth ſhall at laſt own thee, that wert ſo deſpiſed and abhorr'd, to be the Lords annointed, and ſhall ſtoop to thy Scepter and Soveragn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>becauſe of the Lord that is faithful, and the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Lord of his faithfulneſs, bringing this about to make good his promiſe made concerning thee; and theſe Princes being convinced hereof, upon this very account, ſubmitting themſelves to thee; <hi>and he ſhall chooſe thee,</hi> that is, I will chooſe thee, that haſt been deſpiſed of man, to rule over the great Princes of the World. But the meaning is this, that God would make it evidently appear that he had choſen him to be the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Thus, I ſay, theſe words are certainly to be underſtood concerning Chriſt; yet withal, we muſt know, that many learned Expoſitors do underſtand this of Chriſt and the Primitive Church (the Body of Chriſt) jointly together. And indeed it may well be ſaid of the Church of Chriſt, that ſhe was deſpiſed of Man, and abhorred of Nations, and a Servant of Rulers, (or of the Jewiſh Nation particularly) ſo that they looked upon them as the ſcum and the off-ſcowring of all things, and made nothing of killing them; and yet withal, that afterwards even their Kings did honour her, and ſubmit to her, and that upon the account of her Intereſt in Chriſt in whom God hath faithfully made good his promiſes to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:42788:235"/>Ver. 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] The ſame having been expreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> twice before, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and 7. we may well conceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is with reſpect to the greatneſs and the ſtrangneſs of the Myſteries now delivered by the Prophet, that this is the third time here repeated. And it is doubtleſs, God the Father ſpeaks here again to Chriſt, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of Salvation have I helped thee;</hi> and that happily with relation to that which <hi>David,</hi> had long before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of himſelf, as a type of Chriſt, <hi>My prayer is unto thee, O Lord in an acceptable time, Pſal.</hi> 69.13. So that the meaning is clearly this, that when the ſet time ſhould come, which God of his own free grace had appointed for the accompliſhment of the work of mans Redemption, by the death of Chriſt, he would then hear his Prayers and Interceſſion for his people (for theſe words may well comprehend both his Prayers upon Earth, ſuch as that, <hi>John</hi> 17. and his interceſſion in Heaven) and that in the execution of that, whereto God appointed him, he ſhall be ſure of ſupport and aſſiſtance from him, ſee the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1-6 and becauſe by the preaching of the Goſpel, this great work of Mans redemption by Chriſt was made known, and the doing of this, in the time determined by God of his free grace, for the ſalvation of his Redeemed ones, and that even amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was a part of the Office of Chriſt, as Mediator, even this <hi>acceptable time</hi> muſt needs here be comprehended. And therefore we ſee the Apoſtle doth expreſly apply this Prophecy thereto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted; and in the day of Salvation have I ſuccoured thee; behold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of Salvation.</hi> As for the following words, they alſo muſt be accordingly underſtood; <hi>and give thee for a covenant of the People,</hi> that is, to be the Mediator of the Covenant of grace betwixt God and his People; (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.6.) and to make good by thee all the deliverances which by covenants are to be wrought for my People, whether Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as the deliverance out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> or ſpiritual, from the Bondage of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan, whereof that other out of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Bondage, was a ſhadow and type: and ſo likewiſe the laſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>to eſtabliſh (or raiſe up) the earth, and to cauſe to inherit the deſolate heritages:</hi> for as this is ſpoken with relation to the type, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> by the eſtabliſhing or raiſing up <hi>the Earth,</hi> muſt needs be meant the ſetling of the ſtate of the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> again, or the reſtoring of it to its former flouriſhing condition; and by cauſing to inherit the deſolate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritages, is ſurely meant the Peoples re-edifying, and then their re-poſeſſing of their old inheritances, which in the time of their captivity had lain waſte and deſolate. But as it hath reſpect to mans deliverance by Chriſt, that which is intended thereby is, the reſtitution and eſtabliſhing of the Church by him, which was ſunk very low in the Jewiſh Church, by bringing in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be added to the Church, that God had given to Chriſt as his inheritance, by raiſing up and reſtoring to life, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; dead men, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Simeons</hi> concerning Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. <hi>Behold, this Child is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael;</hi> by chearing poor ſinners oppreſſed with the bondage and burden of Sin, &amp; by reſtoring them to their Heavenly inheritance which they had forfeited &amp; loſt by their defection from God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>That thou mayeſt ſay to the Priſoners, go forth; to them that are in darkneſs, ſhew your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, come forth into the light; this is ſtill ſpoken to Chriſt, and as in the type it is meant of the deliverance of the captivtated <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (ſee the Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.13.) ſo principally in the antitype it is meant of Chriſts
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42788:235"/>
ſetting free his redeemed ones by preaching of the Goſpel, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> eſpecially, from that ſpiritual Bondage and blindneſs under which they lay by nature; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.7. and ſo likewiſe the following words, <hi>they ſhall feed in the ways, and their paſtures ſhall be in all high places;</hi> under the ſimilitude of a flock of Sheep, for whom the Shepherd is wont to provide good paſtures, and that are wont, as they are removed from one place to another, to graze on the Road-ways as they go. There is a promiſe made, 1. concerning thoſe that were to return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> both that they ſhould be plentifully provided for by the ways they went, of all things neceſſary; and likewiſe that their Country that had lain long untilled and deſolate, ſhould every where be abundantly fruitful at their return, even in thoſe places that are uſually barren. And 2. concerning Chriſts redeemed ones, that they ſhould plentifully enjoy the means of Grace at all times, and at all places: See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>They ſhall not hunger, or thirſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Promiſe in the laſt clauſe of the foregoing Verſe is further ſet forth; and that ſtill under the ſame Metaphor of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's providing for his Flock, ſee the Notes <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.11. and 41.17, 18. and 48.21. And here again, as in the place laſt cited, there is an alluſion to the proviſion that God made for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, by ſhowring down <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven upon them, and fetching Water for them out of the Rock. And ſo it is likewiſe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>neither ſhall the heat nor Sun ſmite them;</hi> for therein he alludes alſo to that Pillar of the Cloud, that was to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by day a covering from the heat of the Sun, ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.5, 6. And in the laſt clauſe, <hi>for he that hath mercy on them, ſhall lead them, even by the Springs of water ſhall he guide them;</hi> he alludes again to the ſtreams of Water that were fetched out of the Rock. And how this muſt be alſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually underſtood of Chriſt's feeding his Flock with the food of their Souls, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing them with the Waters of Life, and of Gods protecting them, ſo that the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, neither of temptations, nor afflictions, ſhall ever be able to hurt them, we may eaſily conceive, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.17, 18. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 2. And becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the firſt words to the State of the glorified Saints in Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.16. <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more,</hi> &amp;c. It may well be, which ſome Expoſitors ſay, that under this promiſe of the good Chriſt would do for his Church here in this Life, the perfecting thereof in Heavenly Glory is alſo comprehended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And I will make all my Mountains away, and my Highways ſhall be exalted.]</hi> For the meaning of this, ſee the Note upon two like paſſages, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3, 4. Yet as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Chriſt, ſome would have the meaning to be, that thoſe holy ways of Religion, which ſeemed hard and impoſſible to them, ſhould through Grace become eaſie to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Behold, theſe ſhall come from far,</hi> &amp;c.] Firſt it is ſaid in general, that they ſhould come from remote Countries, and then afterwards ſome particular quarters of the world are named, to imply they ſhould come from all parts of the world on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide; <hi>and lo, theſe from the north and the weſt,</hi> &amp;c. This I conceive is clearly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of theſe words, according to our Tranſlation. But now becauſe moſt Expoſitors conceive that three quarters of the world are mentioned in the following mords, <hi>lo, theſe from the north and the weſt, and theſe from the land of Sinim,</hi> that is, ſay they, from the South (holding that thus the South-quarter is ſet forth, either from the people that dwelt upon the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 16.1. or from the <hi>Sinites,</hi> reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poſterity of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 10.17. or from a remote Country in <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Sina</hi> or <hi>China;</hi> or from the inhabitants of <hi>Sien</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> a chief City in <hi>Egypt, Ezek.</hi> 30.15.
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:42788:236"/>
all which they ſay lay South of <hi>Judea</hi>) therefore they do generally underſtand the firſt branch of this Verſe thus, <hi>Behold, theſe ſhall come from far,</hi> that is, from the Eaſt; and ſay that the Eaſt-quarter is thus ſet forth, becauſe the Continent reached fartheſt that way from <hi>Judea,</hi> the Sea being on the Weſt, and the North and South not extending ſo far, by reaſon of the inhabitable <hi>Poles.</hi> But however thoſe, whoſe coming is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, are certainly the ſame that were before intended in a place parallel to this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.5, 6, 7. For which ſee the Notes there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Sing, O Heavens,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.23. This expreſſion of exceeding joy implies the certainty of the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>But Zion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by reaſon of their long continuance in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, and the grievous miſeries they endured there. And ſome add too, that they did thus complain, becauſe the coming of the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was ſo long deferred.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou art always in mine eye, as if I had engraven thee upon the palms of both mine hands; ſo that I am continually mindful of thee, and cannot indeed forget thee, no more than I can forget my ſelf. Some think there is in this expreſſion an alluſion to the memorials which men are wont to hang upon their hands, or upon their fingers, ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.9. or to the Signets or Tablets, whereon they had the names or pictures engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſome perſons whom they did much affect, ſee the Note, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. <hi>thy walls are continually before me,</hi> that is, I continually ſee in what a ſad condition thy Walls lye, and do think of having them repaired again. And hereby alſo is meant, that God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mindful of the preſervation of his Chuch, her Polity and Government, and of the raiſing her up again when ſhe is in a low condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Thy Children ſhall make haſt,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they ſhall with great earneſtneſs flock in ſpeedily to thee; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. <hi>thy deſtroyers, and they that made thee waſte, ſhall go forth of thee;</hi> that is, thine enemies that laid thy Land waſte ſhall no more plead any title to it, but give it up wholly to thee; or thine enemies, that ſought thy ruine, ſhall let thee alone and not trouble thee: Or it may be meant of Gods ridding them of thoſe wicked oppreſſors that were amongſt them. As it reſpects the Church of Chriſt, it may imply Gods freeing her from all that outwardly by force, or within by falſe Doctrine or ſcandalous lives ſhould be likely to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold, all theſe gather themſelves together, and come to thee,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord,</hi> that is, as ſure as I live, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament,</hi> to wit, becauſe their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhould be an honour to <hi>Zion,</hi> eſpecially conſidering they ſhould not be a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Company, ſuch as are blots and blemiſhes to a State, but ſuch as were eminent for their endowments and graces, and therefore of high eſteem both with God and man; <hi>and bind them on thee as a bride doth,</hi> that is, as a Bride puts on her Jewels and other Ornaments; all which is chiefly meant of the honour, which the coming in of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhould be to the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And the ſimilitude of a Bride is the rather uſed, to imply, that the Lord having ſo long ſeemed to have forſaken that Church, by his return then to her, ſhe ſhould ſeem to be as it were anew Married to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>For thy waſte and thy deſolate places, and the land of thy deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thy deſtroyed Land, <hi>ſhall even now be too narrow by reaſon of the inhabitants;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, when thou ſhalt again poſſeſs thy Land, which now lieth waſte and deſolate, it ſhall be ſo fully inhabited, yea, even the moſt ruinous places of it, that there
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42788:236"/>
ſhall ſcarcely by room for thy people to dwell one by another: But this is chiefly meant of the mighty enlargement of the Church by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles: And they that ſwallowed thee up ſhall be far away;</hi> That is, as before, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. thou ſhalt no more be troubled with enemies, that ſhall ſeek to deſtroy thee. But ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>The Children which thou ſhalt have, after thou haſt loſt the other, ſhall ſay again in thine ears, the place is too ſtrait for me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, there ſhall be ſuch multitudes of them, that they ſhall complain that there is not room enough for them. And this is meant of <hi>Zion,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> 1. in regard of the multitudes of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the great increaſe of their poſterity, as formerly in <hi>Egypt;</hi> whereas before ſhe was left as a childleſs woman, when the enemy had made ſuch havock amongſt them, &amp; carried them away Captives: and 2. eſpecially in regard of her great encreaſe by the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the days of the Goſpel; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was as a Childleſs Woman, there being ſo few amongſt them, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as they profeſs themſelves to be, <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, upon the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhe ſhould be abundantly full of Children.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Then ſhalt thou ſay in thine heart,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, ſay ſome, as not being able fully in words to expreſs her joy and admiration; <hi>who hath begotten me theſe, ſeeing I have loſt my Children, and am deſolate,</hi> &amp;c? That is, <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall admire at her wonderful multitudes, becauſe ſhe had been not only Childleſs (ſee the foregoing Note) but alſo <hi>deſolate,</hi> without a Husband, the Lord having ſeemed to caſt her off. And indeed, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Jewiſh Church, and particularly that by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> joyning themſelves to her, was very ſtrange and wonderful, conſidering that before the Goſpel came to be Preached, there was ſo little of the word of Life amongſt them, the Seed of the new-birth; and that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſo unlikely to leave their Idolatries, and to embrace the Religion of Chriſt, and eſpecially to joyn themſelves to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were ſuch a deſpiſed people in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, As men are wont to do, when they call any that ſtand ſome diſtance from them, to come to them; <hi>and ſet up my Standard to the people,</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.10, 12. and 13.2. The meaning is, either that God would call in the Nations, that is, by his Almighty Power cauſe them to come in, and ſo accompliſh what was promiſed in the foregoing Verſes. It may be meant of Gods gathering an Army, as Kings do, by ſetting up their Standard, that ſhould deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſet free his people; but eſpecially it is meant of that which was ſignified thereby, the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the lifting up of that ſpiritual Standard, the Preaching of the Goſpel, accompanied with the effectual working of Gods Spirit; <hi>and they ſhall bring thy Sons in their arms, and thy Daughters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders;</hi> which, as it hath reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> implies that the Nations ſhould ſhew them great love and reſpect, and afford them all poſſible help for their return home into their own Country. But as it reſpects the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it ſets forth their ready tendering of their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, together with themſelves, to be joyned to the Church; even as it is now, when Children are brought in Arms to the Aſſemblies of the Church to be Baptized. Yet ſome would have it underſtood of the great reſpect, which even Pagans ſhould afford to Chriſtians that lived amongſt them, becauſe of the eminent holineſs of their lives.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing Mothers,</hi> &amp;c.] This was accompliſhed, ſay ſome, in the protection and ſupport which the <hi>Jews</hi> found, even during their Captivity, under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings and Queens, and which
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42788:237"/>
the Church ſhould find under Heathen Princes. But rather it is meant of the great and tender reſpect that ſhould be ſhown to the <hi>Jews,</hi> both in their return, and after their return, by <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Eſther</hi> and others; and of great Kings and Queens, that being converted to the Chriſtian Faith, ſhould ſhew great favour to the Church, and do great things for them, ſuch as were <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and many others. And ſo that which follows, <hi>they ſhall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth,</hi> ſome underſtand of Nations that ſhould be ſubdued by Gods people; but rather it is meant of the great honour and reſpect which thoſe Princes ſhould yield to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and eſpecially of the honour which thoſe Chriſtian Princes ſhould yield to Chriſt (and for his ſake, to his Church and Servants) ſubmitting to his Miniſtry, his Scepter and Government; <hi>and lick up the duſt of thy feet,</hi> for which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.9. <hi>and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord,</hi> to wit, experimentally, by my accompliſhing of theſe things which I have promiſed; <hi>For they ſhall not be aſhamed that wait for me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Hereby men ſhall find this to be true.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty? Or the lawful Captive delivered?]</hi> This is generally taken as an objection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> alledging this as a reaſon why they could not believethe promiſe of their being delivered out of their Captivity. But more probably, as I conceive, it may be taken as the proud boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> inſiſting upon two reaſons, why the <hi>Jews</hi> could have no juſt ground of hoping to be delivered, 1. their might, which the poor Captives were not able to reſiſt: and 2dly. their right, becauſe by law of arms and right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, they were their lawful Captives; yea, and under this Type there may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo implied, how unlikely it was in an eye of reaſon, that Satan's bond-ſlaves ſhould ever be reſcued out of his Power.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>But thus ſaith the Lord, Even the prey of the mighty ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered;</hi> &amp;c.] That is, be your enemies, never ſo mighty, and let them pretend what they will for their detaining of you in Bondage, yet ye ſhall be delivered. And withal, obſervable it is, that thoſe whom they had called <hi>the lawful Captive,</hi> the Lord here terms only <hi>the prey of the terrible.</hi> As for that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,</hi> it may be underſtood of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that God would ſet himſelf againſt them; and that to be ſure would be ſufficient; <hi>and I will ſave thy Children;</hi> that is, deliver them out of their Captivity: Or it may be taken as a more general promiſe, that after he had reſcued them out of their Captivity, he would ſtill be an enemy to their enemies, and defend their poſterity againſt all that ſhould ſeek to hurt them. And how this may be applied to that which is ſaid of Chriſts vanquiſhing the ſtrong man arm'd, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21, 22. we may eaſily conceive.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And I will feed them that Oppreſſeth thee, with their own Fleſh, and they ſhall be drunken with their own Blood as with Sweet Wine,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have the meaning of theſe words to be only this, that by deſtroying Gods People they ſhould bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon themſelves; or that as they had deſtroyed Gods People, and thereby had, as it were, eat their-Fleſh, and drunk their Blood, ſo they alſo ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their cruelty ſhould be in a manner ſatisfied with their own Fleſh and Blood, which ſome think might be the more fitly ſaid, becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> brake in upon them, and deſtroyed them when they were Feaſting together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. But rather the meaning is, that they ſhould deſtroy and tear one another in peices, as eagerly as if it were meat and drink, yea ſweet wine to them; and ſo the People of God ſhould need to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing themſelves towards their deliverance: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.20. And indeed
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42788:237"/>
thus it was at the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> thoſe nations that had formerly helped the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Jews,</hi> did then joyn with <hi>Cyrus</hi> in deſtroying the <hi>Caldeans;</hi> yea, as Hiſtories report, the <hi>Caldeans</hi> here divided among themſelves, in ſo much that many of them fell off to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and had a principal ſtroke in the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon. And all Fleſh ſhall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob,</hi> and therefore able to deliver you from all your mightieſt Enemies.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>THus ſaith the Lord, where is the Bill of your Mothers divorcement, whom I have put away?</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> (and very many apply it alſo to thoſe that ſhould live when the <hi>Romans</hi> had broken that Nation in pieces, after their Crucifying of Chriſt) did complain of Gods caſting them off, who had formerly been as a Husband to them, never Charging it upon their own Wickedneſs, whereby they had provoked him to ſuch diſpleaſure againſt them; therefore, in alluſion to that Law; <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.12. (for which ſee the Notes there) whereby the Husband that put away his wife was enjoyned to give her a bill of divorce, and was diſabled for ever taking her again; and by warrant or pretence whereof the <hi>Jews</hi> did uſually put away their wives upon very ſlight occaſions, even upon any diſlike which they took againſt them; the Lord in a way of deriſion doth here challenge them to produce the bill of divorce whereby he had divorced them; <hi>where,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the Bill of your divorcement whom I have put away?</hi> intending thereby, either that he had not caſt them off, but that they had treacherouſly left him; or that he had not caſt off the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in a way of divorce, at leaſt not their whole Nation, nor for ever, never to receive her for his wife again; or elſe (which ſeems moſt probable) that he had not put them away without any juſt cauſe (as they uſed to put away their wives) out of inconſtancy or over-much auſterity, only becauſe it was his pleaſure ſo to do; but upon very juſt grounds, for her baſe adulteries, and breach of the Marriage-Covenant with him. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe tend the following words, <hi>or which of my Creditors is it to whom I have ſold you?</hi> for there likewiſe, in alluſion to that law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.7. (for which ſee the Note there) by warrant whereof many parents, to help themſelves in their want, or pay their debts, were wont to ſell their Children, and their Creditors, when they were no other way able to ſatisfy them, took their Children for their debts, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.1. The Lord requires them to name which of his Creditors it was to whom he had ſold them? imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was moſt abſurd for them to think of him, as of one that could be indebted to any man, or that ſhould through poverty be conſtrained to ſell his Children. And this ſome underſtand of ſelling their Children to thoſe of another Nation; for when they ſold them to any of their Brethren, theſe were always to be ſet free at the year of <hi>Jubile. Behold, for your iniquities have you ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſſions is your Mother put away;</hi> that is, you have ſold your ſelves to Satan, and Sin; ſee the note, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25. or rather by your wickedneſs you have brought your ſelves into the ſtate of Bondage you are in, and have provoked God to caſt you off.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Wherefore when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken of the obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in not receiving God when he came to them by his prophets; and not minding him, nor hearkning to him, when by
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42788:238"/>
them he ſhewed them how they might be delivered, and ſo did as it were tender to reſcue them out of their Bondage; and ſo likewiſe (as ſome think) of their farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in their ſlighting and diſregarding God, when by his own Son he came to them and taught them the way of Life and Salvation; and there was none in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that regarded him; or his Doctrine, or miracles; according to that, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Now accordingly though ſome think this is added to make good the charge in the foregoing verſe, that by their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs they had provoked God to caſt them off, and ſo had brought themſelves into Bondage (if they would have minded God, when he called upon them by his prophets, by the Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles, they had never come into ſuch a ſad condition) yet I rather think, that this is added as a farther Charge, to wit, that as they had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Bondage, ſo they themſelves alſo were the cauſe why they were not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. God had by thoſe he ſent to them ſhown them the way how they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but they would not hearken to him. For thereto tends that which is added; <hi>Is my hand ſhortned at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver?</hi> namely, to ſhew, that they muſt needs yield that it was their ſtubborneſs, in not hearkning to his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and counſels, that was the cauſe why they continued in their Bondage, and were not delivered, becauſe certainly they would not dare to ſay, that his hand was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and could not reach to the working of as great deliverances as he had formerly wrought for his people; to which purpoſe it is that he mentoins thoſe wonderful works of his, in drying up the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> firſt, and <hi>Jordan</hi> afterwards, before the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> For hereto the following words have clear reference, <hi>I dry up the Sea; I make the Rivers a Wilderneſs,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.9. <hi>Their Fiſh ſtinketh becauſe there is no water; and dieth for thirſt;</hi> and indeed we might well think that this might well be ſo at thoſe miraculous dryings up of the Sea and <hi>Jordan,</hi> if we conſider how long they lay dry, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a while Fiſh can live out of the water, and great Fiſh out of great waters; yet ſome I confeſs hold, that this laſt clauſe is meant of the miracles of turning the rivers in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> into Blood, becauſe in the relation of that, there is expreſs mention of the dying of the Fiſh, and the ſtinking of the Rivers thereby. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.17, 18. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I clothe the Heavens with blackneſs, and I make Sackcloath their covering]</hi> That is, I can, when I pleaſe, cover them with black Clouds, and ſo clothe them in a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, habit, as they uſed to be clothed that in times of ſolemn humiliation and mourning wore Sackcloath made of black goats hair. But this is ſpoken alſo with reſpect to the plague of Darkneſs which God brought upon <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 10.21. and, as ſome think, to that miraculous darkneſs that was at the paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned,</hi> &amp;c.] Having before proved that it was by their own wickedneſs that they continued in Bondage, becauſe the Lord was as able to deliver them, as ever he had formerly been; ſo here now he farther proves it, becauſe God was alſo willing to have fitted them for deliverance, as appeared by his ſending, as other his prophets, ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> particularly, fitted and furniſhed for this work. Yea, and under theſe Chriſt is principally intended, of whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a Type, as is evident in the following verſes. And withal this might tend to the encouragement of the better party amongſt them, and for the ſtrengthning of their Faith concerning thoſe promiſes wherewith he was ſent to them, <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned,</hi> that is, the tongue of a learned and able teacher, one that hath been well taught and inſtructed, and that is fitted to move and affect the Hearts of thoſe to whom he ſpeaks; which how it was moſt eminently accompliſhed
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42788:238"/>
in Chriſt, ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. <hi>that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary,</hi> that is, ſeaſonably to chear up thoſe that were wearied with the miſeries they endured, or overpreſſed with the burden of their ſins. And this indeed is that which Chriſt dayly doth by his Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, according to that, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, <hi>he wakeneth morning by morning,</hi> that is, God doth ſtir me up to receive inſtructions from him continually, day by day, yea, early every day (for it may well be which ſome think, that the morning is purpoſely mentioned, as the fitteſt time for learning) meaning, that God did continually reveal his will to him, which he accordingly did reveal to them, as our Saviour ſaid expreſly of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.49. <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the father which ſent me, be gave me a commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak:</hi> Yea, and there are that think, that as this expreſſion reſpects Chriſt, it implies, that he was conſtantly informed by Gods Spirit, and not at times only, as the Prophets were: <hi>He makeneth mine ear to hear as the learned,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, as Learned Teachers are wont to excite their Diſciples to learn; or as others, moſt diligently, as men are wont to hear thoſe that are eminently learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rather, as thoſe that do not hear idly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit to themſelves, but that become learned by their Teaching; as thoſe that are not only learners, but learned. Thus I conceive theſe words muſt be underſtood of the Prophet, as the Type; but principally of Chriſt, as the Antitype. I know indeed that many Expoſitors hold, that this cannot be meant of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but of Chriſt only, becauſe we read not that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ever endured that which followeth, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> But this might be objected likewiſe concerning many paſſages in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> clearly ſpeaks of himſelf, though as a Type of Chriſt; for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.18. and 40.6, 7, 8. and 69.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine Ear,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he cauſed me to hearken to him, to know his Will, and to obey him in all things he gave me in charge, ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. <hi>and I was not rebellious,</hi> which might covertly imply a reproof of the peoples rebellion; as if he had ſaid, <hi>I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious</hi> againſt the Word of God to me, as you have been againſt that which from God I have ſpoken to you; <hi>neither turned away back,</hi> that is, I neither refuſed to go, when God ſent me; nor did I ſhrink or turn away from doing what was given me in charge, notwithſtanding all the hard uſage I met with in the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I did chearfully and willingly ſubmit to be thus opprobriouſly uſed for the faithful diſcharge of my Office. And indeed, conſidering that they uſed other the Prophets of God thus, as <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 King. 22.24. and <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 20.2. It is very probable that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo was thus uſed; eſpecially in the days of wicked <hi>Ahaz; and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> However it is clear that all this was done unto Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.26, 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.63, 64. and 18.32. unleſs it be in that one particular of plucking off his hair; which though it be not expreſly mentioned by the Evangeliſts, yet their mad rage and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſage of Chriſt in all other regards, joyned with this prediction of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> may well encline us to think, that even this amongſt other things they did to him. And if not ſo, we muſt then look upon that as a proverbial expreſſion, implying, that they uſed him with all poſſible ſcorn and contempt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For the Lord God will help me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he will aſſiſt me in the diſcharge of mine Office, and uphold me againſt all that oppoſe me: And as this is ſpoken with relation to Chriſt, it imports the carrying him through the work of the Mediator, even to the raiſing of him out of the Grave, and ſo cauſing him to triumph over Hell and Death; <hi>therefore ſhall I not be confounded:</hi> that is, diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſcouraged; their ſhameful uſage of me ſhall not make me aſhamed; <hi>therefore have I ſet my face like a flint,</hi> that is, I harden my ſelf againſt all the oppoſition and injuries I meet with, not to fear them, nor to be troubled at them: For becauſe theſe paſſions will be ſeen in the face, therefore is this phraſe uſed of ſetting his face like a flint, as likewiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.9. <hi>harder than flint have I made thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> that is, ſo courageous as not to be moved with all that wicked men can do to thee; <hi>and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> to wit, of my hope and patience, but that the iſſue will be good.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>He is near that juſtifieth me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God will be ſtill ready to juſtify my cauſe, to wit, that I was truly ſent by him, and have faithfully diſcharged my Office; And as this reſpects the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the meaning may be that God would juſtify him by bringing to paſs all that he foretold, and by defending him againſt his enemies. But as it reſpects Chriſt, it may be meant of all that God did, tending to the clearing of his innocency, and the juſtice of his cauſe, eſpecially at his death, and afterwards, as the teſtimony given to Chriſt by <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Centurion, the riſing of the dead out of their Graves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his triumphant Reſurrection and Aſcention into Heaven, and the converſion of ſuch multitudes by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and ſome of them ſuch as had been themſelves active in the crucifying of him; <hi>Who will contend with me?</hi> That is, who will argue or plead againſt me? <hi>Let us ſtand together,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42788:239"/>
to wit, to argue the cauſe with thoſe that oppoſe and perſecute me, before God the juſt Judge of all men. And to this place the Apoſtle ſeems to have alluded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth. Who is be that condemneth?</hi> &amp;c. and that very fitly; becauſe from hence it may be clearly gathered, that it is in vain to condemn thoſe, whom God juſtifies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Behold, the Lord God will help me,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Who is he that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me?</hi> to wit, juſtly, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi> See alſo <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.59. <hi>Lo, they all ſhall wax old as a garment:</hi> That is, though mine enemies be never ſo ſplendid and glorious, yet as a ſplendid Garment wears away, they ſhall be outworn and periſh. <hi>The Moth ſhall eat them up,</hi> That is, they ſhall by degrees be waſted and conſumed. And as it concerns thoſe that contended with the Prophet, it may ſeem to have reſpect to their being waſted in their long captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the laſt clauſe of the foregoing Verſe denounced judgment againſt the Prophets enemies (and ſo Chriſts alſo, as the antitype) this is here inſerted for the comfort of the godly amongſt them, thoſe that did obey the voice of Gods Servant, to wit, the Prophet, or Chriſt and his Miniſters, See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1. There were but a very few ſuch amongſt them as this queſtion imports, <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. (See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12.) But yet thoſe that were ſuch, the Prophet (on Chriſt of whom he was a Type) doth here by his example (of whoſe confidence in God much is before ſpoken) exhort them to truſt in God; And it is indeed <hi>a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary,</hi> for the ſpeaking whereof, as it is ſaid before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. God had given him the tongue of the learned; <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light,</hi> that is, that is in great diſtreſs, miſery and ſorrow, and void of all inward comfort, through the apprehenſion of their lying under the Wrath of God. <hi>Let him truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> that is, in God, who hath declared himſelf able to comfort and ſupport them in their greateſt ſufferings, and to deliver them out of their greateſt troubles, and hath withal promiſed that he will do it; <hi>and ſtay upon his God,</hi> to wit, in regard of the covenant which, through Chriſt, God hath made with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing Verſes encouraged the righteous amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt their long continued calamities, and ſtirred them up to caſt their care upon their God; here the Lord returns to denounce judgment againſt the generality of the people, that ſlighted his Word, and deſpiſed his Promiſes, <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks,</hi> &amp;c. And ſome underſtand this of their kindling the fire of Gods wrath againſt them by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold wickedneſs, and their incenſing him to overwhelm them on every ſide with Judgments, which ſhould utterly conſume and burn them up, See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.31. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we muſt then underſtand the following words, <hi>Walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that you have kindled,</hi> as ſpoken ironically, thus, Walk on deſperately in theſe your wicked ways, not fearing the fire which you have ſet a flaming about you; and ſee what the iſſue of it will be. But rather it is meant, as the moſt of Expoſitors take it, of all thoſe vain things, wherein that wicked people did flatter and chucker themſelves. <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid in a way of deriſion, you that do encourage and chear up your ſelves, and even compaſs your ſelves about with ſuch variety of devices and carnal counſels on every ſide, wherewith you hope to ſafeguard your ſelves, and ſeek to comfort your ſelves againſt all the evils and judgments wherewith you are threatned, rejecting the conſolations of Gods Word, even as men ſhould ſit and warm and refreſh themſelves at a great many fires they had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about them (and hereby is meant, 1. the vain hopes of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the days of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in their ſtrength, and policy, and confederacy with other Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which made them ſlight the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that God made them by the Prophets; and ſecondly, their confidence in their own natural righteouſneſs, and in the falſe Doctrines and Traditions of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> which made them deſpiſe and diſregard Chriſts Goſpel Promiſes) <hi>Walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks which ye have kindled,</hi> chear up your ſelves as much as you can with theſe brands and ſparks of your own kindling, with theſe fleſhly hopes and comforts, all will be to no purpoſe; <hi>this ſhall ye have of mine hand,</hi> that is, by my juſt judgement upon you, <hi>ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow,</hi> that is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe vain ſelf-deceits of yours, you ſhall be overwhelmed at laſt with unremovable anguiſh and ſorrow, out of which you ſhall never riſe again: ye ſhall dye in your ſin, and ſo ſhall be laid in a bed of darkneſs and inſufferable ſorrow and torments unto all eternity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>HEarken to me,</hi> &amp;c.] The Lord having, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of the foregoing <hi>Chap.</hi> encouraged the faithful amongſt the People to truſt in God, though their condition might ſeem never ſo hopeleſs; but then <hi>ver.</hi> 11. turning to the generality of People, denounced Judgment againſt them; here he returns again to comfort the godly party amongſt them, <hi>Hearken to me, ye that follow after Righteouſneſs;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.21. It may be meant of hungring and thirſting after the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but rather doubtleſs of ſtriving to do that which was juſt and right in Gods Eyes. <hi>Ye that ſeek the Lord,</hi> that is, that ſeek to approve your ſelves to him, and to aſſure your Intereſt in him, and that ſeek to him in all your ſtreights. Now that which he firſt aſſays here to comfort them in, is concerning the ſmall number to which they ſhould be brought, before that deliverance and reſtitution of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhould be wrought, which by him God had promiſed them; and hereby may be meant, both the fewneſs of that little Remnant that ſhould come home out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in compariſon of the numerouſneſs of that Nation formerly: And likewiſe the paucity of Believers that ſhould be found in that Nation, when Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah ſhould come to them with the glad tydings of Salvation. And that which he ſaith to encourage them herein, is, That he adviſeth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how miraculouſly he had formerly multiplied their Nation: <hi>Look unto the Rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the Pit whence ye are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> That is, as it is explained in the following Verſe: Look to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> out of whoſe Loins, you, the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had your deſcent. And the rather we may well think that <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>the Rock,</hi> and <hi>Sarah the hole of the Pit,</hi> that is, the Stone-querry out of which they were <hi>hewn</hi> and <hi>digged,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Abrahams dead Body,</hi> and <hi>the deadneſs of</hi> Sarahs <hi>Womb, Rom.</hi> 4.19. They being both in regard of Age like dry and hard Rocks, ſo that there ſeemed to be no likely, yea, in a natural way, no poſſibility that they ſhould have any iſſue, until God was pleas'd miraculouſly to open <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb. Now if God did at firſt from ſuch a dead Stock raiſe ſuch a numerous Nation, as they had been; why ſhould they be diſcouraged at that very ſmall Remnant to which their Church ſhould be brought?</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Look unto</hi> Abraham <hi>your Father, and unto</hi> Sarah <hi>that bare you,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added by way of explaining the former Words, <hi>for I called him alone;</hi> that is, I brought him out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> when he was a lone man, one Man, and Childleſs too, yea without hope of having any Children
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:42788:240"/>
by <hi>Sarah,</hi> being barren, and at laſt, by reaſon of Age, paſt any hope of Childing: <hi>And bleſſed him, and encreaſed him;</hi> that is, as in many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards I bleſſed him, ſo particularly in the mighty encreaſe of his Poſterity, ſo that they became as the Stars in the Heaven, or the Sand on the Sea-ſhore for multitude; and hereby is implyed, that the ſame God that did this, could likewiſe encreaſe and multiply their Church and People, though they were brought to never ſo poor a Remnant: See the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For the Lord ſhall comfort</hi> Zion, &amp;c.] To wit, with manifold bleſſings, and particularly with an abundant encreaſe, as he did <hi>Abraham.</hi> See the foregoing Notes. And this may be meant both of the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1.) and of the Church in the days of the Goſpel: <hi>He will comfort all her waſte places;</hi> that is, he will raiſe up her City and State again, and thoſe places that lay deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſhall be inhabited again with multitudes of people: <hi>And he will make her Wilderneſs like</hi> Eden, <hi>and her deſart like the Garden of the Lord;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1, 2. But now as this is meant of the Church in the days of the Goſpel, it muſt needs intend the holy change that ſhould be wrought in Believers; and particularly the mighty alteration that ſhould be made in the Apoſtatiſed Church of the Jews by the Converſion of a Remnant of them, and by the great acceſs of the Gentiles: <hi>Joy and gladneſs ſhall be found therein, thanksgiving,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2. But as this hath reſpect to the days of Chriſt, it is chiefly meant of the great joy that ſhould be wrought in afflicted Conſciences by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Hearken unto me, my People, and give ear unto me, O my Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken ſtill to the faithful amongſt the Jews, Gods peculiar People; ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>for a Law ſhall proceed from me;</hi> that is, (ſay ſome that would limit this to the Jews that were to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi>) as I will bring home my People to their own Land; ſo I will govern them there as mine own People. Do not think that Religion ſhall be loſt amongſt them by their long Bondage; when I have brought them home they ſhall be governed by my Law, as formerly. And accordingly they expound the following Clauſe: <hi>And I will make my Judgment to reſt for a light of the People;</hi> that is, I will make good my Promiſes to my People in the ſight, and to the convincing of all Nations. But queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is that new Law of the Goſpel, which God here ſaith ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from him for the governing of his Church; for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3, 4. And ſo one main drift of the Words ſeems to be, to ſhew how the Church of the Jews ſhould be ſo exceedingly multiplied, as was before ſaid, namely, by the coming in of the Gentiles to them. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we muſt underſtand the next Clauſe: <hi>And I will make my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſt for a light of the People;</hi> that is, I will cauſe my Goſpel to reſt amongſt the Gentiles, as a light which the Enemies thereof ſhall never be able to blow out. For it is not ſtrange that the Goſpel ſhould be called Gods <hi>Judgment,</hi> becauſe it is the Rule which God hath given us to judge of Good and Evil, and the Scepter whereby he governs his
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:42788:240"/>
Church; and Law, and Doctrine, and Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Words ordinarily uſed in the Scripture promiſcuouſly one for another.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>My Righteouſneſs is near,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The time is near at hand, when I will approve my ſelf Righteous and Faithful, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my promiſe of ſaving you out of the hands of your Enemies; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.27. And this may be meant both of that deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of our deliverance by Chriſt from our Spiritual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Enemies; and the laſt, the rather, becauſe the expreſſion here uſed, may alſo imply our being made Righteous by Chriſt, and Chriſts governing his Church as a Righteous King; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.10, 11. <hi>My Salvation is gone forth;</hi> ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.19. The expreſſion here uſed may relate, either to the making known Gods Decree to the People by his Prophets, or to the approaching and going forth of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Decree concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance. <hi>And mine Armes ſhall judge the People;</hi> that is, by mine Almighty Power I will puniſh the Nations, the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> and others, that oppreſs my Church; or by mine own Power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and confirmed by many miraculous Works; many Nations ſhall be Converted, and ſhall ſubmit themſelves to my Government. And indeed the ſtretching forth of his Arms ſeems to imply the enlarging of Gods Kingdom: And hereto like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agrees that which followeth; <hi>the Iſles ſhall wait upon me;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.1. and 42.4. It may imply the miſerable condition of the Gentiles, in regard whereof it might be ſaid, that they waited for Salvation by Chriſt, even as it is ſaid of the bruit Creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27. that they wait upon God for his giving them their Meat in due ſeaſon: Or rather the readineſs of the Gentiles, after their Converſion, to obey all the commands of Chriſt: <hi>And on mine Arm ſhall they truſt;</hi> that is, they ſhall in all things rely on my Power and Aid.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Lift up your Eyes to the Heavens, and look upon the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he ſhould have ſaid, conſider how wonderfully the whole fabrick of the World is, by the mighty Power and provident Care of God over it, upheld and preſerved; <hi>For the Heavens ſhall vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like Smoke, and the Earth ſhall wax old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein ſhall die in like manner;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.26. <hi>But my Salvation ſhall be for ever, and my Righteouſneſs ſhall not be aboliſhed;</hi> of all which the meaning is, either, 1. That though there ſhould be never ſuch horrid overturnings in the World, God would not fail to make good his Promiſes in the Salvation of his People; or, 2. That though the whole frame of the World ſhould at laſt be diſſolved, yet the promiſed Salvation ſhould not fail, but ſhould continue for ever; or, 3. (which moſt Expoſitors like the beſt) that the whole World ſhould rather be broken in pieces and come to nothing, than God would not make good his Righteouſneſs and Faithfulneſs, in working that Salvation for his People which he had promiſed them; which is the ſame with that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.33. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall not paſs away.</hi> Though Gods People may chear up themſelves by ſeeing
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42788:241"/>
how God preſerves and upholds the whole fabrick of the World, yet in the unqueſtionable certainty of his Promiſes there is a ſurer Foundation of Hope and Comfort for them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Hearken unto me, ye that know Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and regard it, that live Righteouſly; <hi>the People in whoſe Heart is my Law;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.31. And this is the third time that they are here called upon to hearken to what is ſaid; becauſe it is ſo hard a thing to chear up thoſe that are in great miſery and ſorrow: <hi>Fear ye not the reproach of Men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings;</hi> that is, when your Enemies ſhall reproach you for your Piety and Confidence in God, fear them not, no, not the greateſt of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For the Moth ſhall eat them up like a Garment, and the Worm ſhall eat them like Wool,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, like a Woollen Cloth, or Garment; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.9. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>But my Righteouſneſs ſhall be for ever, and my Salvation from Generation to Generation;</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And as this is meant of that great work of our Salvation by Chriſt, the word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> may have alſo reſpect to that everlaſting Righteouſneſs whereby Gods People are juſtified and ſaved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Awake, awake, put on Strength, O Arm of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet, and haply in the name of Gods People, doth here pray, that God would exert the power of his mighty Arm, which he had ſeemed of late to lay by, by deſtroying his Peoples Enemies, as he had promiſed. And this may be meant both of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and of the ſpiritual Enemies of Gods People vanquiſhed by Chriſt, who is therefore by ſome thought to be <hi>the Arm of the Lord</hi> here ſpoken of; and ſeems purpoſely intended to chear the Hearts of Gods People with the remembrance of his Almighty power: <hi>Awake, as in the ancient days, in the Generations of old;</hi> that is, as in times of old, when thou haſt often delivered thy People, and deſtroyed their Enemies. <hi>Art not thou it that hath cut</hi> Rahab? ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.4. <hi>and wounded the Dragon?</hi> that is, deſtroyed <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.13, 14. Now becauſe the ſtrength of Gods Arm is unchangeable, and not ſubject to the leaſt decay, therefore theſe Inſtances are alleadged, as a ſure proof, that he could do the ſame ſtill for his People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] The Church and People of God do here chear up themſelves, from the conſideration of thoſe great things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the foregoing Verſe, which God had done for his People: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the redeemed of the Lord ſhall return and come with Singing unto</hi> Zion, &amp;c. ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>I, even I am he that comforteth you,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet ſpeaks again to them in the name of God: <hi>Who art thou?</hi> that is, What a vain, fooliſh, heartleſs Creature art thou? <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a Man that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man that ſhall be made as Graſs?</hi> To wit, having the Eternal and Almighty God to be your Protector and Saviour: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:42788:241"/>Ver. 13. <hi>And forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.1.21. <hi>that hath ſtretched forth the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. <hi>and haſt feared continually every day, becauſe of the fury of the Oppreſſor, as if he were ready</hi> (or, <hi>had made himſelf ready) to deſtroy?</hi> That is, as if the Enemy were ſure to deſtroy, becauſe he was fully reſolved, and had made ready to do it: Intimating, that it was their great Sin to be ſo overwhelmed with fear in their greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, having the promiſe of God for their deliverance; <hi>and where is the fury of the Oppreſſor?</hi> That is, ſay ſome, what is become of the fury of thoſe that formerly oppreſſed my People? As namely, of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. or of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> of whom ſee what is ſaid before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.4. Though they were ready to deſtroy, did not their fury ſoon come to nothing? And if God deſtroyed them, is not he able to do the like to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> too? But rather it is ſpoken with reſpect to the <hi>Babylonian; and where is the fury of the Oppreſſor?</hi> That is, aſſoon as I begin to contend with him, what will become of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? It will ſoon come to nothing: Or it may be taken more generally, that when ever the Enemies of Gods People do oppreſs them, God can ſuddenly put an end to their Fury; and that he will at laſt ſo perfectly deliver his People, that they ſhall no more be in danger of being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The Captive exile haſteneth that he may be looſed,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Gods poor People, that are now Captive in a ſtrange Country, ſhall within a ſhort time be delivered; the time haſteneth when they ſhall be ſet at Liberty. Now though there ſeems to be an alluſion in the Words to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> concerning whom it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.33. That <hi>the</hi> Egyptians <hi>were urgent upon the People, that they might ſend them out of the Land in haſte;</hi> yet queſtionleſs it is meant (in the type) of the Captivated Jews in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the time of their deliverance was coming on apace; and in the antitype of Chriſts delivering his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, that were in bondage to Satan, bound with the Fetters of Sin and Death; who ſhould with all readineſs embrace the Salvation tendered them in the Goſpel. And accordingly we muſt underſtand the following words, <hi>and that he ſhould not die in the Pit;</hi> that is, in that Pit of miſery whereinto they were fallen; or in thoſe Priſon-houſes wherein they were kept in <hi>Babylon:</hi> Or (as it reſpects Chriſts ranſomed ones) that they might not periſh for ever in the bottomleſs Pit of Hell; <hi>nor that his Bread ſhould fail;</hi> that is, that the poor Captives in <hi>Babylon</hi> might not periſh there, for want of neceſſary proviſion in their long continued thraldom, or in their return homeward, by reaſon of the deſart places they were to go through: Or (as it reſpects thoſe that are redeemed by Chriſt) that they might be inſtructed in the myſteries of the Goſpel, and not want that Spiritual food of their Souls. And in this too there may be an alluſion to Gods care over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom he delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they ſhould not want Bread to eat, as they travelled through the Wilderneſs to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which ſeems the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe of that which followeth in the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:42788:242"/>Ver. 15. <hi>But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the Sea,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, The red Sea, <hi>whoſe Waves roared,</hi> to wit, by reaſon of the violent blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eaſt Wind, wherewith God divided the Waters of the Sea, that ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might paſs over on dry ground, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And I have put my words in thy Mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] Expoſitors dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much in their Judgments concerning the Perſon to whom this is ſpoken. That which ſeems to me moſt probable, is, That it is ſpoken firſt to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as the type; but then, ſecondly, under him to Chriſt, and to all his Prophets, and faithful Meſſengers and Miniſters; or, as ſome ſay (which is all one in effect) to Chriſt, and to his People, as the Body of Chriſt. However the drift of the words is clear: Namely, That this is ſpoken to comfort his People, as before, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. by aſſuring them, 1. That the Prophet ſpake Gods Word to them, nothing but what he had enjoined him, and in the very words and terms which he had prompted to him; and that therefore they had no cauſe to queſtion the promiſes that he made them. And the like we muſt hold concerning Chriſt, who often affirmed this, that he ſpake nothing but what God had put into his Mouth; ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. and 8.26.28. And, 2dly, That God would ſecure him from all his Enemies, <hi>and have covered thee in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of mine hand;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.2. And then to ſhew what ſhould be the effect of this, the following words are added, <hi>that I may plant the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth;</hi> That is, That I may hereby create a new World, a new Heaven, and a new Earth. Now we muſt know, that though this may be meant of the Jews deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe there was then ſuch a change wrought amongſt that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as if they had been brought into a new World; and becauſe that is uſually aſcribed to the Miniſtry of Gods Prophets, which they did only declare and foretell, as in that <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. <hi>See I have this day ſet thee over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant:</hi> Yet certainly it is meant principally of that great change and renovation, that God by Chriſt did actually and effectually work in the World at his coming, by the Work of his Redemption, and the publiſhing thereof by the preaching of the Goſpel; by means whereof the curſe was taken off from the Creatures, which the Sin of Man had brought upon them, and all things that were before, as it were, broken and ruined, were reſtored and ſettled in Chriſt; and (which is chiefly intended) a holy Church is gathered and planted throughout the World, who are reconciled to God and made new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a People whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, and who are daily fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for heavenly Glory; <hi>and ſay unto</hi> Zion, <hi>Thou art my People;</hi> That is, That God might ſay, to wit, by the Prophets, Apoſtles, and others, by whom it is publiſhed, and by Chriſt, by whom it was both effected and publiſhed, ye that were not my People, are now become my People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Awake, awake, ſtand up, O</hi> Jeruſalem, &amp;c.] Some think, that becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were at this time proud and ſecure, and fearleſs of any Evil that was coming upon them, like a drunken Man fallen into a dead
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:42788:242"/>
ſleep, by reaſon of a Spirit of drunkenneſs and ſlumber that God had pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth upon them: therefore God by the Prophet doth here awaken them, and calls upon them to ariſe and repent, and turn unto the Lord. And indeed expreſſions much like to theſe are uſed by the Apoſtle in this ſenſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. But by the whole current of the Text it appears, that this is ſpoken by way of comforting them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might diſregard the promiſe of deliverance which God had made them, by reaſon of that extremity of miſery and oppreſſion under which they lay; therefore there is hope here given them, that notwithſtanding that depth of Calamity, whereinto they were fallen; yet God would raiſe them up. And accordingly comparing them to a People, that by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cup of Gods wrath, were fallen down and lay in a dead ſleep; he calls upon them to awaken and ariſe up: <hi>Awake, awake, ſtand up, O</hi> Jeruſalem; as if he had ſaid, There will be ſuddenly a happy change; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lye no longer, O my People, in ſo ſad and diſconſolate a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>which haſt drunk at the hand of the Lord the Cup of his Fury:</hi> That is, Whom God hath in his juſt wrath puniſhed with great ſeverity; <hi>thou haſt drunken the dregs of the Cup of trembling, and wrung them out;</hi> that is, the whole Cup of Gods indignation, even to the very bottom, dregs and all, (which in bitter potions uſe to be the bittereſt) and thoſe preſſed and ſqueezed, that nothing might be left. The meaning is, That they had ſuffered the whole that God had meaſured out to be their portion; or, ſo much that one would think their miſery could not be well greater than it was. And why this is called a Cup of trembling; ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. and 60.3. and 75.8. Now this may be conceived to be ſpoken: 1. With reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> And, 2dly. With reſpect to their greater deſtruction by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that following glorious condition, whereto that Church was raiſed by Chriſt, and eſpecially in the acceſs of the Gentiles: yet it may be applyed, as it is by ſome Expoſitors, to the very ſad condition, whereinto the Church of Chriſt may be brought by her perſecuting Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Gods appearing ſeaſonably for their deliverance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>There is none to guide her among all the Sons whom ſhe hath brought forth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Amongſt all that have been bred and brought up in her, there were none, neither King, Prince, nor Prophet, that were able to lend her a helping hand for her aid or deliverance; none that could counſel or comfort her, uphold or direct her: For in thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>there is none to guide her,</hi> and, <hi>neither is there any that taketh her by the Hand;</hi> there is ſtill an alluſion to the ſupporting and leading of one that is drunk; and of whom this is meant, ſee in the foregoing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Theſe two things are come unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] There is a like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 47.9. <hi>Who ſhall be ſorry for thee?</hi> that is, there is none that will lay thy miſeries to Heart, or that will condole thy ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thee. And this indeed is a great addition to any Mens miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when no body pities them, nor diſcovers the leaſt fellow-feeling they have of their Griefs and Sufferings: Whence is that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>I looked for
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42788:243"/>
ſome to take pity, and there was none.</hi> The great queſtion is, which are the <hi>two things,</hi> the two Evils before mentioned, that were come upon them; that is, that were to come upon them. Some think that theſe are ſet forth in the following Words, <hi>Deſolation and Deſtruction, and the Famine and the Sword.</hi> For though four things ſeem here to be mentioned; yet they are reducible to two Heads; <hi>Deſolation,</hi> to wit of the City and Land; and <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> to wit, of the People, being mentioned as the <hi>two things</hi> before intended; and then <hi>the Famine and the Sword</hi> are added, as the means whereby the City and Land were laid deſolate, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants deſtroyed. But I rather think that the <hi>two things</hi> that are here ſaid ſhould come upon them, are, the Evil that ſhould come upon them by their Enemies from without, comprehended in thoſe Words, <hi>Deſolation and Deſtruction, and the Famine and the Sword;</hi> the other from within, namely, that they ſhould have none amongſt themſelves that ſhould be able to help, adviſe, or comfort them; implyed in thoſe queſtions, <hi>who ſhall be ſorry for thee?</hi> And afterward in the cloſe of the Verſe, <hi>by whom ſhall I comfort thee?</hi> As if he had ſaid, alas! there is none to comfort thee; ſee the Note before <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And this we find often mentioned in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Lamentations, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Among all her Lovers ſhe hath none to comfort her,</hi> and ver. 21. <hi>They have heard that I Sigh, there is none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me.</hi> Yet I know by ſome theſe laſt Words are otherwiſe expounded, <hi>by whom ſhall I comfort thee?</hi> that is, by whoſe Example, that hath been in the like miſery, ſhould I aſſay to comfort thee? Which is all one in effect, as if he had ſaid, alas! thy miſeries are matchleſs, and without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. And indeed we find a like expreſſion uſed to ſet forth <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Calamities, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>What thing ſhall I take to Witneſs for thee? What thing ſhall I liken to thee, O Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem! <hi>what ſhall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Thy Sons have fainted,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Through extremity of grief, or, as being in a manner ſtarved; and ſo inſtead of being able to uphold and comfort thee, they are ready to periſh themſelves; <hi>they lie at the head of all the Streets;</hi> that is, all the City over they lye in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Streets, they lie languiſhing, as being houſeleſs and harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, quite famiſhed in a manner; and ſo not able to ſtand or go. Some, I know, underſtand this of the multitude of Carcaſes of men ſlain or famiſhed, that lay ſcattered about the Streets unburied. But that agrees not with the following ſimilitude, <hi>as a wild Bull in a Net,</hi> that is, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and afflicting themſelves, but no way able to help themſelves, no, not thoſe that have formerly been of greateſt Power and Strength; no more then a wild Bull can do, when he is once taken in the Huntſmans Net, though he fume and toil himſelf with ſtriving and tumbling about never ſo much: <hi>they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God;</hi> that is, full of the Calamity and Miſery, that vexation and anguiſh, which God in his juſt wrath hath brought upon them. But in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion there is an alluſion alſo to that <hi>Cup of Fury</hi> mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. whereof God had cauſed them to drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:42788:243"/>Ver. 21. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe thy miſery is ſo great, and thou haſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered what I allotted for thy portion; <hi>hear now thou afflicted and drunken, but not with Wine;</hi> to wit, as formerly thou wert wont to be, but with the Cup of Gods Fury, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And indeed theſe expreſſions of love and pity do clearly ſhew, that the drift of all that went before was the comforting of Gods People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Thus ſaith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God, that pleadeth the cauſe of his People,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.39. <hi>Behold, I have taken out of thine Hand the Cup of trembling, even the Dregs of the Cup of my Fury;</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>thou ſhalt no more drink it again;</hi> That is, Thou ſhalt no longer drink of that Cup; the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhall no longer keep thee in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, nor ſhall ever any more come to oppreſs thee. He doth not ſay, That they ſhould never be brought into ſuch a ſad condition any more, (for after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were often brought very low; and by the <hi>Romans</hi> they drank deeper of the Cup of Gods Fury than ever; inſomuch that unto this day they are drinking the dregs of it) but that there ſhould be an end of their Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And indeed, if this promiſe be extended, as it is by ſome, to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their ruine by the <hi>Romans,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of that Remnant of them that embraced the Chriſtian Faith, (for the reſt of them were then caſt off from being Gods Church) and of this Remnant this promiſe ſhall for ever hold good, that they ſhall no more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and caſt off from being Gods People, as the Generality of the Jewiſh Church were.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Miſeries, which they brought upon thee, others ſhall bring upon them; <hi>which have ſaid to thy Soul,</hi> that is, to thee; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>bow down that we may go over;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>and thou haſt laid thy body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over:</hi> The meaning is, That in their Bondage in <hi>Babylon</hi> their great Lords ſhould trample upon them proudly and contemptuouſly, and without any Compaſſion, and uſe them juſt as they pleaſed themſelves, they not daring in the leaſt to mutter againſt them. And the like may be ſaid too concerning their ſad condition, when they were vanquiſhed by the <hi>Romans.</hi>

This is ſtill to chear up the Jewiſh Church with hope of deliverance from that poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition, whereinto they were to be brought; and it is thus often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, partly, becauſe of the delight the Prophet took in imparting theſe
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42788:244"/>
glad tydings to the People; and partly becauſe the People were ſo hardly wone to embrace the promiſe, in regard that they looked upon their Eſtate as deſperate, and paſt all hope of recovery: <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy Strength, O</hi> Zion; that is, pluck up a good courage, be courageous and ſtrong in the confidence of Gods favour and protection, which is indeed properly <hi>thy ſtrength; put on thy beautiful Garments, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the holy City;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Put off thy poor and ſad attire, wherewith thou wert clad in thy low and captived Eſtate, when thou wert wont to embrace the Dunghill, and put on that brave attire again, which thou wert accuſtomed to wear on thy Feſtivals, and other times of Joy and Gladneſs: As for the following words, wherein there is a reaſon given, why Gods People are ſtirred up to be ſo courageous and joyful; <hi>for henceforth there ſhall no more come into thee the uncircumciſed and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;</hi> though ſome underſtand it of the great Reformation that ſhould be made amongſt them, that no wicked ones ſhould harbour amongſt them; or of the great holineſs of the Church in the days of the Goſpel, which ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Heavenly Glory: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.8. Yet certainly it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant of their being freed from the Cruelty and Tyranny of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But how then was this promiſe ever made good to the Church of the <hi>Jews; from henceforth there ſhall no more come into thee the uncircumciſed and the unclean?</hi> I anſwer: As this was ſpoken with reſpect to their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> the meaning cannot be that they ſhould never more be invaded, vexed and oppreſſed by any of the uncircumciſed Heathens: For it is well known, that after that they were ſorely afflicted and oppreſſed by <hi>Antioches Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> and others; and that at laſt the <hi>Romans</hi> did worſe to them, than ever the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had done. And therefore if we take this as a promiſe made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were delivered from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> it muſt be limited to the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> to wit, that they ſhould <hi>no more</hi> be invaded, as they had often formerly been, nor tyrannized over by that Nation, that had then ſo long held them in Bondage; and he tearms them <hi>the uncircumciſed and the unclean;</hi> becauſe in their Bondage this did moſt vex and afflict them, that they, Gods peculiar People, ſhould be made drudges to ſuch a baſe, heatheniſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed People. But now, if we extend this to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after they were ruined and deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> namely, thoſe that were, together with the Gentiles, the Church of Chriſts redeemed ones; I ſee no other way, that it can be underſtood, but that their wicked Enemies ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ruine them, as the Jewiſh Church was by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And this is that which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. that his Church ſhould ſtand in the midſt of all oppoſition, till ſhe be taken up into Heaven, where her Enemies ſhall trouble and afflict her <hi>no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Shake thy ſelf from the duſt,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſeems to be thus expreſſed, with reference to that which had been ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. (See the Note there) of their lying on the ground, whilſt their proud Lords trampled upon them; <hi>ariſe and ſit down,</hi> or, <hi>ariſe and ſit up</hi> (as it is well render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our great Annotations) Lie no longer on the ground, but ſit in a quiet and comfortable condition, as formerly. As <hi>Babylon</hi> was commanded to <hi>come down and ſit in the duſt, Chap.</hi> 47.1. So <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is here called upon to ariſe
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42788:244"/>
and ſit up from the duſt; <hi>looſe thy ſelf from the bands of thy neck, O captive Daughter of</hi> Zion; That is, caſt off thy Yoke. But ſtill we muſt know, that the intent of this is to ſhew, that this ſhould ſhortly be done; and that under this type there is alſo a promiſe couched, of the Spiritual Redemption of the Church of God by Chriſt: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, ye have ſold your ſelves for nought: and ye ſhall be redeemed without Money.]</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.13. and 50.1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.12. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> might think it impoſſible, that they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they had been kept in bondage ſo long, under ſuch a mighty People; therefore God tells them here, that though they had ſold themſelves by their Sins; that is, though he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them up to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> by way of puniſhing them for their Sins; yet he, their Lord and Soveraign, had never ſold away his intereſt in them, by receiving any price of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> for them; they did not ſo much as give him thanks for them; and that therefore they could alledge no juſt Title to them, but that it was free for him, when he pleaſed, to challenge his own juſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them, and to recover them out of their hands again. By all which it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there would be no difficulty in the work of their deliverance: If God would challenge his juſt intereſt in them, and deliver them from thoſe that did unjuſtly keep them in bondage, who could hinder him? As they were ſold for nought, ſo they ſhould be redeemed for nought: As they were ſubdued by the Sword, ſo by the Sword they ſhould be delivered out of their Power: And indeed in this too ſome Expoſitors endeavour to ſhew, how the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> had ſome ſhadow in it of our Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c.] By former examples of the Lords delivering his People from the oppreſſion of their Enemies, he ſheweth them what good reaſon they had to believe and wait for that deliverance out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which he had now promiſed them; <hi>my People went down aforetime into</hi> Egypt <hi>to ſojourn there;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, And ye know how the <hi>Egyptians</hi> oppreſſed them there, and how he plagued the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for it, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his People out of that their bondage; <hi>and the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>oppreſſed them without cauſe;</hi> as if he had ſaid, and ſo likewiſe <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (and ſome would have all the reſt of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings included, that invaded Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) did mightily afflict them, cauſeleſly, when my People had no way injured them; (for though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had at firſt revolted from him, yet he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubmitted himſelf to him, and by mutual agreement made him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and ye know how God deſtroyed him and his mighty Army, and delivered his People from their Rage and Fury. Thus I conceive, is the meaning and drift of this Verſe. There is a hint here given the <hi>Jews</hi> of two former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances that God had wrought for his People; and then in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe he ſhews what might be inferred from hence concerning the ſadder condition of his People in <hi>Babylon.</hi> I know indeed that ſeveral Expoſitors do judge otherwiſe concerning the ſecond clauſe, <hi>and the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>oppreſſed them without cauſe:</hi> For ſome think, that by <hi>the Aſſyrian</hi> there, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> is meant; and ſo they would have the meaning of the whole Verſe to be this, That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> only to ſojourn there; the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42788:245"/>
King of that Country did without cauſe ſorely oppreſs them. But this opinion is built upon meer groundleſs and improbable conjectures; as namely, that that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that knew not <hi>Joſeph, Exod.</hi> 1.8. was a Stranger, even an <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> or elſe, that all Tyrants were in thoſe days, by a Proverbial way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called <hi>Aſſurs.</hi> Others therefore ſay, that by <hi>the Aſſyrian</hi> the <hi>Babylonian</hi> is meant, and that he is here called <hi>the Aſſyrian,</hi> becauſe the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon</hi> was always formerly a branch of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, and all <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was at preſent under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yea, the rather too, becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> frequent invading <hi>Judea,</hi> in former times, did open a Door to that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Conqueſt which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> did afterward make of that People, and their carrying them away Captives into <hi>Babylon.</hi> And ſo accordingly they make the Senſe of the whole Verſe to be this, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did of old wrongfully oppreſs the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they ſojourned amongſt them; and that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had now done the like. But the former Expoſition is far the cleareſt; to wit, that there are here two Inſtances given of Gods pleading the Cauſe of his oppreſſed People formerly; and that God argues from hence by an Argument taken from the greater to the leſs; that if God puniſhed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for dealing ſo hardly and inhumanly with his People, that went down into that Country voluntarily of their own accord, that they might ſojourn there, though the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> had ſome pretence for what he did, becauſe they were in his Dominions, and under his Juriſdiction. And ſo again, if God deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that only invaded and waſted the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and afflicted them there in their own Country; much more will he puniſh the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who without cauſe invaded their Country, and carryed them away Captives into a ſtrange Land.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Now therefore, what have I here, ſaith the Lord, that my People is taken away for nought?</hi> &amp;c.] The firſt words are very conciſe in the original; and therefore may be underſtood ſeveral ways: As 1. With reference to that which was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Now that my People hath been forcibly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away into <hi>Babylon,</hi> without any price paid to me for them; what have I here? that is, what gain and advantage do I get by their being here in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? As if he ſhould have ſaid, Surely nothing at all; it was not a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of my making, neither do I get any thing by it; and therefore why do I delay the reſcuing of my People from this their Captivity? Or, 2. With reſpect to the foregoing Verſe: Seeing I could not endure the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that oppreſſed my People, but puniſhed them, <hi>what have I here</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> that ſhould move me to ſpare them that have carried them away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into a ſtrange Country, which the other did not? Or, <hi>what have I here</hi> to do, but to deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to haſten the deliverance of my People from their greater oppreſſion here? Or, 3. As bewaling the deſolations of <hi>Judea;</hi> having no People left me here in <hi>Judea,</hi> what do I here? Why do I not go away to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and fetch my People from thence? Or, 4. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Bondage in <hi>Babylon;</hi> what have I here in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that I ſhould be as it were as a Captive here amongſt my People, and not carry them back again to my Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And laſtly, ſome take it as ſpoken with reſpect to the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when Chriſt, their promiſed Meſſiah, was
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42788:245"/>
ſent unto them; why do I ſtay any longer amongſt this People ſold over for nought, and not remove from them, and gather to my ſelf another People? Or, what do I ſpeak of what my People ſuffer here in <hi>Babylon?</hi> ſeeing they lye under a far greater oppreſſion of their Spiritual Enemies? Why do I not haſten to deliver them from that bondage? All theſe ſeveral ways theſe firſt words are underſtood by Expoſitors, not without ſome ground of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. But the firſt, I conceive, doth beſt ſuit with our Tranſlation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever according to what is ſaid in this firſt branch of this Verſe, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the following words; <hi>they that rule over them, make them to howl, ſaith the Lord;</hi> to wit, becauſe of their cruel oppreſſing them, both outwardly and in their Conſciences alſo; <hi>and my name continually every day is blaſphemed;</hi> to wit, by the wicked Enemies of my People, who continually inſult, as if I were not able to deliver my People out of their hands. Indeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirms, that this might be applyed to the Enemies blaſpheming Gods name, becauſe of the wickedneſs of thoſe that profeſs themſelves his People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. But doubtleſs the Prophet intended here the Heathens blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by their boaſting that he was not able to protect or deliver his People, according to what we find alſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20. <hi>And when they entered unto the Heathen whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they ſaid to them, theſe are the People of the Lord, and are gone forth out of his Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Becauſe my People have been thus carried away for nought, and have been thus cruelly oppreſſed, and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Enemies have thus blaſphemed my Name, <hi>my People ſhall know my Name;</hi> that is, they ſhall experimentally know that I am the Lord Jehovah, the only true God, of Infinite Power, and faithful to make good all my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; according to that which followeth; <hi>therefore they ſhall know in that day;</hi> to wit, when my People ſhall be delivered out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and when all things ſhall be accompliſhed by Chriſt, that were foretold of him by the Prophets; <hi>that I am he that doth ſpeak, behold it is I;</hi> that is that it is I the Lord God that do now foretell theſe things by my Prophets, in that I will exactly then accompliſh what I now foretell.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tydings,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, How welcome, delightful, and acceptable ſhall the coming be, and how highly eſteemed ſhall the perſons be, of every one of thoſe that ſhall bring to <hi>Zion,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſituate in a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Country, the glad tydings of the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deliverance of Gods People from their Captivity there; yet there may be, I confeſs, an emphaſis in theſe words; <hi>how beautiful are the feet,</hi> &amp;c. as if it had been ſaid, The very feet of theſe Men, though duſty and dirty with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, will be beautiful and amiable in the Eyes of Gods People; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.9. <hi>that publiſheth Peace;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.18. <hi>that bringeth good tydings of good, that publiſheth Salvation, that ſaith unto</hi> Zion, <hi>thy God reigneth;</hi> that is, he hath now manifeſted his regal Power in governing the World, by deſtroying his Enemies, and delivering his People, and hath again taken them to be under his Protection and Government, and to ſerve
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:42788:246"/>
and worſhip him in his Temple according to his Laws, as formerly. Now by theſe welcome Meſſengers are meant, both the Prophets that foretold theſe things, and likewiſe thoſe that did firſt make known to the <hi>Jews</hi> the purpoſe of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſet them at Liberty, and the Meſſengers that from <hi>Babylon</hi> were ſent before-hand to acquaint thoſe that were left in <hi>Judea.</hi> But certainly this was chiefly accompliſhed in the Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel; as is evident by the Apoſtles applying this place thereto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tydings of good things!</hi> And as this is intended, the Phraſe here uſed ſeems to have reſpect to the Apoſtles travelling into many Countries, to preach the glad tydings of that Salvation and Peace, which in Chriſt was tendered to them; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. And that which is ſaid, <hi>thy God reigneth,</hi> is meant of the Kingdom of Chriſt, according to that expreſſion ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by the Baptiſt and Chriſt: <hi>Behold the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Thy watchmen ſhall lift up the voice,</hi> &amp;c.] By the <hi>watchmen</hi> here ſome underſtand the ſame that in the foregoing Verſe were mentioned, as the Meſſengers that brought good tydings to <hi>Zion.</hi> And indeed, if by them we underſtand the Prophets and Apoſtles, it is clear, that both theſe are tearmed <hi>watchmen</hi> in the Scripture; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17. But it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by others ſaid, that by their Watchmen here, are meant thoſe Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſhould ſtand in the Watch-Tower about <hi>Zion,</hi> who, when they ſhould ſee the People flocking home from <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to what the Meſſengers ſent from thence had told them, ſhould <hi>lift up their voice;</hi> to wit, with great joy and confidence, to proclaim unto the People thoſe glad tydings; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.1, 9. And to imply that many of them ſhould do this, (which was a clear evidence of the certainty of it) therefore is that added, <hi>with the voice together ſhall they ſing;</hi> to wit, as being raviſhed with Joy to ſee Gods People come back again; <hi>for they ſhall ſee Eye to Eye, when the Lord ſhall bring again</hi> Zion; that is, they ſhall with their Eyes ſee the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives come home into their own Country: As the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſay to <hi>Zedekiah, Ezek.</hi> 34.3. <hi>Thine Eyes ſhall behold the Eyes of the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and he ſhall ſpeak with thee Mouth to Mouth.</hi> But now referring this to our Redemption by Chriſt, the Watchmens lifting up their voice, muſt be underſtood of the Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel unanimouſly, with great joy and aſſurance of Faith to all Nations, according to that of the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Their ſound went into all the Earth;</hi> and ſo likewiſe that which is ſaid of their ſeeing <hi>Eye to Eye,</hi> when the Lord ſhould bring again <hi>Zion,</hi> muſt be underſtood of their being Eye witneſſes of Chriſts performing the great work of our Redemption; for which ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 4.20. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Break forth into joy,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words may be taken, as the Words of the Prophet, or the words of the Watchmen, mentioned in the foregoing Verſe; <hi>Break forth into joy, ſing together ye waſte places of</hi> Jeruſalem; to wit, becauſe now, upon the return of Gods People, we ſhall be all built up again, and abundantly repleniſhed with Inhabitants; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.19. and 51.3 And under this may be alſo comprehended, the building up of the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:42788:246"/>
Church (eſpecially by the acceſs of Gentiles) which at the coming of Chriſt was miſerably waſted and weakned; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1. <hi>for the Lord hath comforted his People;</hi> to wit, by their Redemption, and the bleſſed effects that followed thereupon; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.3. for ſo it is expreſſed in the following words, <hi>he hath redeemed</hi> Jeruſalem; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.23. But withall obſervable it is, how this expreſſion agreeth with that <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Simeon</hi> was a juſt and devout man, <hi>waiting for the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>The Lord hath made bare his holy Arm in the Eyes of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c.] By making bare, that is ſtretching forth, or ſtripping his Arm, is meant the clear diſcovering and making viſible his Almighty power to Men, by delivering his People, and deſtroying their Enemies; ſo that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, far and near, ſhould with admiration take notice of this wonderful work of God; and he ſaith <hi>his holy Arm,</hi> becauſe it was Gods holineſs that ingaged him to do this for thoſe whom he had ſet apart to be a holy People unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1, 2. <hi>and all the ends of the Earth ſhall ſee the Salvation of our God;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.20. It is thus often repeated, to imply the care and ſpeed that was required herein. And under this typical departure out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> men are alſo called to come out of the World, namely, out of that ſtate of uncleanneſs and bondage, wherein the World lies, and from the fellowſhip of the wicked of the World, by a true Converſion and Profeſſion of Chriſt, according to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. as it follows here, <hi>touch no unclean thing, go ye out of the midſt of her;</hi> which as it enjoyned a care to keep themſelves clean, or to purifie themſelves from all legal uncleanneſs; ſo likewiſe, eſpecially that which was ſignified thereby, that they ſhould not ſuffer themſelves to be polluted with the Superſtitions and other wickedneſs of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> amongſt whom they lived; <hi>be ye clean, ye that bear the Veſſels of the Lord;</hi> that is, ye that are Prieſts, and Levites; for I conceive it is clear by that which is ſaid, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8.24. (See the Note there) that the carrying back of the holy Veſſels and Utenſils of the Temple, which <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> had carried away to <hi>Babylon,</hi> was committed to the Levites, and that therefore they are here particularly and principally charged to keep themſelves unpolluted. And ſo under this type, all Chriſtians, that are <hi>an holy Prieſthood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. (Miniſters eſpecially, that are intruſted with diſpenſing Gods Ordinances) are preſſed to be ſingularly pure and holy.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>For ye ſhall not go out with haſte, nor go by flight,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> poſted away out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the People preſſing them to be gone without any delay, and themſelves haply ſuſpecting leſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould repent of the leave he had given them, and again oppoſe their departing: See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.33, 39. and 14.5. And ſome think that this is added to imply, that in this regard there would not be ſo much danger of defiling themſelves by the caſual touching of any unclean thing, (of which he had warned them in the foregoing Verſe)
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42788:247"/>
as if they had been to go away in any tumultuous haſte. But ſure the main ſcope of theſe Words was to arm the People againſt any doubts that might ariſe in their minds, concerning any difficulty they might meet with in their get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for to prevent any ſuch fears, he tells them, that they ſhould not make an eſcape out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as thoſe that ſteal away out of a Country without the conſent of their Prince, that make all the haſte they can for fear of being purſued and ſurprized; or, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſuch haſte, that they had not time to leaven the Bread they were to carry with them; but that they ſhould go away openly, orderly, and freely, without any fear of diſturbance, as being ſet at liberty by Supream Authority; or juſt as a King ſhould carry away his People, having vanquiſhed their Enemies, marching away triumphantly with Banners diſplayed. And then further, to hearten them, he adds that which was chiefly conſiderable; to wit, That God, whoſe will it was that they ſhould be ſet at liberty, would go along with them, and guide and ſafe-guard them on every ſide, before and behind; <hi>for the Lord will go before you and the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will be your rereward;</hi> wherein there is an alluſion to the Lords going along with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the Pillar of a Cloud and Fire, which ſometimes went in their Front, and ſometimes in their Rear, as when it ſtood between them and the Army of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 14.19, 20. And in all this we may conceive a ſhadow and reſemblance alſo of our Spiritual deliverance by Chriſt; in that Chriſts redeemed ones do come free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntarily, through Grace, out of their ſpiritual bondage, and are thenceforth kept by the Power of God unto Salvation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Behold my Servant,</hi> &amp;c.] Many learned Men begin the following Chapter with theſe words. And indeed theſe three laſt Verſes of this Chapter are clearly of the ſame Subject with that, and do together contain an entire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt. Having promiſed the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that God would be with them to protect and bleſs them, after they were delivered; here now he proceeds to Prophecy concerning Chriſt: 1. Becauſe the main and chief end of that deliverance was, That he, the promiſed Meſſiah, might ſpring from that Nation, who was to rear up the Throne of <hi>David;</hi> and upon whom depended the making good of all Gods Promiſes: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. 2. Becauſe that deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was a type and ſhadow of that Spiritual deliverance of Gods People, which was to be accompliſhed by Chriſt, and chiefly intended by the Spirit of God in all the foregoing promiſes concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> 3. Becauſe his aim here might be to comfort his people, by ſhewing them, that it was no wonder, though God brought them very low before he exalted them, ſeeing it ſhould be ſo alſo with their Lord and Head, the promiſed Meſſiah, <hi>Behold my Servant;</hi> that is, Chriſt: See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1. <hi>ſhall deal prudently;</hi> to wit, in his exact obeying the will of God, which is the higheſt point of Wiſdom, and in his wiſe managing all that belonged to the Office God had impoſed upon him; or, <hi>he ſhall proſper;</hi> to wit, in that he ſhall perfectly finiſh the work, wherewith the Father ſhall entruſt him, concerning Mans Redemption. And indeed this Tranſlation ſuits beſt with that which followeth; <hi>he ſhall be exalted and extolled, and be
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42788:247"/>
very high;</hi> that is he ſhall be every way exalted in his humane Nature tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently above all the Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth; to wit, in the uniting thereof in one Perſon with the only begotten Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. in the eminency and excellency of his gifts, far above all other men, in the mighty effecting of the work of mans Redemption, but eſpecially in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, and ſitting down at the right hand of his Father; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. The ſpreading of his Name and Glory throughout the World, by the preaching of the Goſpel, and the high and honourable eſteem, which Believers ſhall have of him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>As many were aſtonied at thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Some would have this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Mens being <hi>aſtonied,</hi> in a way of admiration and reverence, at his Doctrine and Miracles; as where it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.28, 29. <hi>The People were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine,</hi> and 8.27. <hi>But the Men marvelled, ſaying, what manner of man is this, that even the Winds and the Sea obey him?</hi> And ſo they underſtand this Verſe, as if it had been expreſſed thus: As many ſhall adore and admire and reverence him for his Word and Works, ſo others ſhall as much deſpiſe and abhor him; which they think is intended in thoſe following words; <hi>his viſage was marred more than any mans,</hi> &amp;c. But it is clear, that our Tranſlators underſtood it not thus, becauſe they make the reddition of the ſimilitude to be in the following Verſe. And therefore according to our Tranſlation it is clearly meant of Mens being aſtoniſhed at the contemptible and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein the Lord Chriſt ſhould be in the World; having ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, how he ſhould proſper, and how highly he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; he adds this concerning the low and ſad condition wherein he ſhould be for a time, <hi>As many were aſtonied at thee,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould have ſaid, It is true, that at firſt nothing of ſuch a glorious condition, nothing of ſuch exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſeen in thee, my Servant; rather multitudes ſhall be <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> at thine extream low, and deſpicable, and miſerable Eſtate, as not enduring to think that the promiſed Meſſiah ſhould be ſuch a one as thou art. But yet, <hi>As many were aſtonied at thee</hi> for this, ſo many ſhall as much afterward admire thy Glory and Majeſty, And this is in ſeveral tearms expreſſed in the next Verſe. Only firſt in this Verſe, to ſhew what it was for which many ſhould be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, theſe words are added as in a Parentheſis; <hi>his viſage was ſo marred more than any man, and his form more than the Sons of Men;</hi> which muſt not be underſtood of any deformity in his Countenance or Perſon, but of the contemptibleneſs and miſery of his outward condition above all men whatſoever, no way ſuitable in the Eye of reaſon, for him that was indeed the Lord of Glory; as namely, in that he was born of ſuch mean Parentage, and lived in ſuch a poor and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable condition, and was ſo ſcorned, and reviled, and abuſed, and afflicted all his Life long, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6. but eſpecially in regard of his unparallell'd ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at his Paſſion, both outwardly in his Body, and in the anguiſh of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when indeed his outward appearance was as of a man ignominiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected both of God and his People; and he that was <hi>fairer than the Children of Men, Pſal.</hi> 45.2. through the imputation of our Leproſie became the moſt ſad and loathſome ſpectacle that ever was ſeen amongſt the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:42788:248"/>Ver. 15. <hi>So ſhall he ſprinkle,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added with reference to the firſt words of the foregoing Verſe: <hi>As many were aſtonied at thee; ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall he ſprinkle many Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Which is all one in effect, as if it had been ſaid: As many ſhall be aſtoniſhed at his baſe and contemptible condition, ſo ſhall many alſo, yea many Nations, be as much aſtoniſhed at his Exaltation, and the great works that ſhall be done by him; for this is intended by theſe words; <hi>So ſhall he ſprinkle many Nations,</hi> &amp;c. for by ſprinkling many Nations is meant, either that he ſhould diſtill down the ſhowers of the Goſpel, and therewith ſhed forth the dew of his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. among many Nations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be converted and brought to ſubmit to his Scepter; wherein there is an alluſion to the watering of the Earth with Rain or Dew from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. Or elſe, that he ſhould purge and cleanſe them by that his Spirit, accompanying the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and by his blood through faith applyed unto their Souls for their Juſtification and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. which is therefore called <hi>the Blood of ſprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12.24. Wherein there is an alluſion to thoſe ſprinklings of Men in the time of the Law with Water or Blood, or both meant together, which were for the purifying of thoſe that were legally unclean; or rather to that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental waſhing with Water, wherewith Chriſt appointed the ſpiritual clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſtians by his Blood and Spirit, to be ſealed unto them in Baptiſm. And ſo by thoſe words, <hi>the Kings ſhall ſhut their Mouths at him;</hi> is meant, That even the Kings of the Heathens ſhould be ſilent before him; to wit, either as not able to expreſs the greatneſs of his Majeſty and Glory, or by way only of admiring his tranſcendent excellency and reverencing him for it, or by way of admiring him for his Doctrine, and ſilent attending upon his Teaching; See the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 29.9. not daring any way to gainſay or oppoſe him, but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own wiſdom and ſubmitting themſelves chearfully to his Scepter and Government. And thus though the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould reject him; yet the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould embrace him; of which the reaſon is given in the following words, <hi>for that which had not been told them ſhall they ſee, and that which they had not heard ſhall they conſider;</hi> that is, they ſhall ſee the accompliſhment of thoſe things which the Prophets had foretold, whereof they had heard nothing, and ſhould hear and ſeriouſly meditate of thoſe Goſpel Myſteries, <hi>which in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ages was not made known to the Sons of Men, Eph.</hi> 3.5. And hence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth this place to juſtifie his Preaching the Goſpel amongſt the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.21. <hi>But as it is written, to whom he was not ſpoken of, they ſhall ſee; and they that have not heard, ſhall underſtand.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WHO hath believed our report,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, thoſe <hi>good tydings,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.7. which we from God have reported to his People. In the Septuagint the word <hi>Lord</hi> is inſerted; and ſo accordingly we find it rendered where this paſſage is cited in the New Teſtament, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> And accordingly we may well conceive it to be ſpoken by the Prophet, in the name of all thoſe who had publiſhed, or ſhould publiſh thoſe glad tydings concerning Chriſt, whether the Prophets that had foretold them, or Chriſt and his Apoſtles that ſhould make known the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, and that by way of bemoaning and bewailing to God the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of thoſe to whom they were preached. It is indeed commonly held by Expoſitors, that it is the incredulity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here complains of. And it cannot be indeed denied, that they are here primarily intended, both becauſe this complaint ſeems to be oppoſed to that which the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of the foregoing Chapter, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpreading of Chriſts Kingdom amongſt many Nations; as if he had ſaid, Though the Gentiles ſhall readily ſubmit to him, yet how few of the <hi>Jews</hi> will be won to believe in him? And likewiſe becauſe the Evangeliſt ſaith expreſly, that this was accompliſhed in the <hi>Jews, Joh.</hi> 12.37, 38. <hi>But though he had done ſo many Miracles before them, yet they believed not in him: That the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet might be fulfilled, which he ſpake; Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> &amp;c. But yet I ſee not why it might not be intended of the paucity of thoſe that ſhould believe theſe glad tydings concerning Chriſt, both amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for even amongſt them there are but a very ſmall Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of thoſe that truly believe, in compariſon of thoſe that believe not. And therefore we ſee St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of his preaching the Goſpel to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, alledgeth this Prophecy, to ſhew that it was no wonder, though but a few of the Gentiles did embrace theſe glad tydings of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they have not all obeyed the Goſpel: For</hi> Eſaias <hi>ſaith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> I conceive therefore that this is ſpoken of the incredulity of all, to whom the Goſpel ſhould be preached, though in the firſt place, and principally of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Prophet knowing, that what he had ſaid, and what he was further to ſay, concerning Chriſt, were Myſteries which Fleſh and Blood would not, nor could not believe, unleſs they were ſupernaturally enlightned and perſwaded thereto by the Almighty power of Gods Spirit, he breaks forth into theſe words; <hi>who hath believed our Report? and</hi> (which is the ſame in effect,) <hi>to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> That is, to how few ſhall theſe things be revealed by the mighty power of God, working by
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:42788:249"/>
Chriſt, and ſhewing forth it ſelf in Chriſt, and in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel (which is therefore called <hi>the power of God unto Salvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. without which indeed no Man can believe? See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.9. and 52.10. The expreſſion here uſed, <hi>to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> ſeems to be taken from Workmen, that are wont to ſtrip up their Sleeves, and make bare their Arms, when they ſet themſelves to work.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For he ſhall grow up,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the reaſon is given why ſo few of the Jewiſh Nation ſhould believe the glad tydings of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles concerning Chriſt, and accordingly, why ſo few ſhould entertain him as the promiſed Meſſiah, namely, becauſe of the mean and contemptible condition, both of his Perſon and Kingdom outwardly. They expected a Meſſiah, that ſhould come in Princely State, as ſome mighty Monarch, that ſhould deliver them from their bondage under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and therefore ſeeing no ſuch thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt, but the quite contrary, he being ſo exceeding low and mean in the World, they could not endure to think that he ſhould be their promiſed Meſſiah. <hi>For he ſhall grow up,</hi> to wit, Chriſt, in his humane Nature, of whom the Prophet had ſpoken in the cloſe of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>before him;</hi> that is, before God, who had ſent him into the World as his Servant, (and ſo it may be ſpoken as with relation to that in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold my Servant,</hi> &amp;c.] and under whoſe provident Eye and Protection, and Bleſſing he grew up: Or, <hi>before him,</hi> that is, before the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that did ſo ſcorn and deſpiſe him, <hi>as a tender Plant, and as a Root out of a dry ground,</hi> a Succour (as we uſually call them, and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word here ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) that ſprings out of the root of a Tree, that grows in a dry, ſandy, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ground, a poor ſlender Twig, in danger to be trodden down by every foot; See the Note, <hi>Chap,</hi> 11.1. The meaning is, That he ſhould be amongſt the great ones of his time, as ſuch a poor ſhrivelled Twig amongſt many tall and ſtately Trees; <hi>he hath no form nor comelineſs;</hi> that is, there was no ſplendor outwardly, either in his perſonal ſtate, or in his Kingdom; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.14. <hi>and when we ſhall ſee him</hi> (this is ſpoken as in the perſon of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and as ſetting forth what the Judgment of Fleſh and Blood in all men would have been) <hi>there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him;</hi> that is, there was no ſightlineſs, nothing that was deſirable in him, at leaſt nothing that ſhould induce Men to deſire him as the promiſed Meſſiah. He lived for thirty years together unknown, and in a poor and mean condition, and his Church was at firſt poor and of no eſteem, and becauſe of this, he that was <hi>the deſire of all Nations, Hag.</hi> 2.7. was looked upon as one that had nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> &amp;c.] Not only not deſired, as was ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, but alſo <hi>deſpiſed and rejected,</hi> as a vile, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, which was that St. <hi>Peter</hi> charged the <hi>Jews</hi> with, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.14. <hi>But ye denied the holy one and the juſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A man of ſorrows;</hi> that is, full of all ſorts of ſorrows all his life long, but eſpecially at his paſſion, ſo that he might ſeem to be even made up of ſorrows, <hi>and acquainted with grief;</hi> that is, inured and accuſtomed to grief; all manner of griefs and ſufferings were familiar and ordinary with him: <hi>And we hid as it were our Faces from him;</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:42788:249"/>
which is again ſpoken of the generality of the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Some indeed read this, as it is in the Margin; <hi>he hid as it were his face from us;</hi> and they that render it ſo, underſtand it of Chriſts hiding his Face, as it were, out of ſhame, becauſe of his ſad and deſpicable condition; as the <hi>Lepers</hi> by the Law were appointed to hide and cover their Faces, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.45. But it is far better rendered in our Tranſlation; <hi>and we hid as it were our Faces from him;</hi> to wit, by way of loathing him, as an abominable Perſon, whom they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to behold; or by way of hatred and deteſtation, as being aſhamed to own him, or to converſe with him; or laſtly, by way of diſregard, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as not thinking him worthy to be in the leaſt minded or looked after. And that this laſt is chiefly intended, the following words may incline us to think, which ſeem to be added for the explaining of this; <hi>he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not;</hi> whence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. That <hi>he made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Surely,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Prophet ſhews, why Chriſt was to live in ſuch a mean and contemptible Eſtate, and to ſuffer that abundance of grief and ſorrow, mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. (hereby alſo to imply the folly of thoſe that ſtumbled at this) namely, becauſe he was to take upon him the guilt of our Sins, and the puniſhment which our ſins had deſerved; <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows;</hi> that is, the guilt of our Sins, the diſeaſes of the Soul (as the word here uſed in the Original doth properly ſignifie) and all thoſe infirmities, griefs, ſorrows, and pains, which mans Nature in general is ſubject and liable to becauſe of Sin (for thoſe perſonal infirmities, ariſing from the ſeveral conſtitutions and complexions of men, Chriſt did not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) for thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth this, as is moſt probable in alluſion to this place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our Sins in his own body.</hi> The great queſtion concerning this place is, how it is by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> applyed to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Cures which Chriſt wrought, if it be to be underſtood as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.16, 17. <hi>He caſt out the Spirits with his word, and healed all that were ſick: That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet, ſaying, Himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi> But to this two anſwers are given by Expoſitors: The firſt, which moſt agree in, is, That the Evangeliſt ſaith that this Prophecy was fulfilled in theſe miraculous Cures of Chriſt, becauſe they were a type and ſign, that he was come to cure them of, and deliver them from their Sins, the Spiritual diſeaſes of their Souls; by theſe miraculous cures he taught them as it were; that he was come to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, by bearing the puniſhment due to their Sins, that ſo their Sins might be pardoned, and God being reconciled to them, might ſhew mercy in curing them of their bodily diſeaſes. But then the ſecond anſwer is, (which ſeems to me far the cleareſt and plaineſt) that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, That this Prophecy of <hi>Eſaias</hi> was fullfilled, when Chriſt cured ſuch a multitude of ſick and diſeaſed Perſons, becauſe by his tender pity and bowels of compaſſion towards thoſe ſad afflicted Creatures, he ſhewed plainly, that, together with our Nature, he had aſſumed the penal infirmities of our Nature, and therefore had a ſad fellow-feeling of the pains and griefs, which thoſe poor wretches did endure. But however that the Prophet did intend this which he here ſaith of Chriſts bearing in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42788:250"/>
the puniſhment which our ſins had deſerved, is evident by the following words, wherein he ſheweth how far otherwiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> would judge of his ſufferings, <hi>yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted;</hi> that is, inſtead of eſteeming him according to the tranſcendent dignity of his perſon, we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be one whom God had juſtly plagued and puniſhed for his notorious wickedneſs. And hence it was that they mocked him for his hoping in God; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He was grievouſly <hi>tormented,</hi> (ſo it is rendered in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) and cruelly afflicted, even to the taking away of his Life; not for his own wickedneſs, (which the <hi>Jews</hi> vainly conceited, as was ſaid in the foregoing Verſe) but to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for our Sins; <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him;</hi> that is, he was puniſhed to procure our peace, that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation being by him wrought for us, we might be at peace with God, and might enjoy peace in our Conſciences; and ſome add too, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover for us all that bliſs and proſperity, which we had loſt by our Sins, even the favour of God here, and Life Eternal hereafter: <hi>and with his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> and from hence doubtleſs the Apoſtle took this expreſſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>All we like Sheep have gone aſtray,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, All Mankind, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>we have turned every one to his own way;</hi> that is, we have all left the way of Life, and have wandered, ſome in one by way, and ſome in another, <hi>and the Lord hath laid on him,</hi> to wit, as our ſurety, <hi>the iniquity of us all;</hi> that is, the guilt and puniſhment of all the Sins of us all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he was by the violence of his Enemies ſorely and unjuſtly afflicted; <hi>yet he opened not his Mouth,</hi> which may be underſtood of that which is recorded by the Evangeliſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſtanding ſilent, when he was arraigned and accuſed before the Judgment Seat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.62, 63. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.12, 13, 14. <hi>inſomuch,</hi> as it is ſaid there, <hi>that the Governour marvelled greatly,</hi> perceiving, as it is likely, in his countenance the ſigns of a meek and quiet and undiſturbed mind; and that it was not out of anger or ſtubbornneſs, that he anſwered not. But certainly that which is intended here is, that <hi>he opened not his mouth</hi> in any way of impatience, either againſt God, or againſt his Enemies. It is clear in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> that Chriſt ſpake ſeveral times from the beginning to the end of his paſſion, yea, and ſometimes by way of clearing his innocency, and the injuſtice of their dealing with him; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.55. <hi>Are ye come out againſt a Thief with Swords and Staves for to take me? I ſat daily with you, teaching in the Temple,</hi> &amp;c. And when he anſwered the Officer that ſmote him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.23. <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil; but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> and ſo in other places. But I ſay, here by not opening his Mouth is meant, that he did not open his Mouth in any way of impatience or murmuring, or by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering any unwillingneſs to ſuffer, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> For indeed the very ſcope of this place is to ſhew, that Chriſt ſuffered willingly, and not meerly
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:42788:250"/>
by conſtraint, and did patiently ſubmit to his Fathers appointment herein; though his natural deſires were againſt his ſufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me;</hi> yet he readily, and without any repining, ſubmitted his will to the will of his Father; (without which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his ſuffering could not have been ſatisfactory to the juſtice of God) See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. knowing that he was to ſtand in the ſtead of poor Sinners, and to ſuffer what their Sins had deſerved, he would not by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of diſcontent ſhew any diſlike of what he endured. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which followeth, for having ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray,</hi> as in alluſion thereto, he expreſſeth here the patient ſubmiſſion of Chriſt to his ſufferings under the Similitude of a Lamb or Sheep; <hi>he is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter;</hi> that is, As a Lamb goeth as quietly to the Slaughter-houſe, as if it were going to the Field or Fold; ſo did this Lamb of God, knowing that he was to be the Prieſt, as well as the Sacrifice; ſo did he go patiently to lay down his Life for Sinners, <hi>and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb;</hi> that is, makes no clamouring noiſe, as Swine and ſome other Creatures will do, when Men lay hold on them, but is uſually ſilent, though the Shearers do not only cut off her Coat, but alſo many times clip her Skin; <hi>ſo openeth he not his Mouth;</hi> to wit, by way of ſilent and free ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to all his ſufferings, that we might with open Mouth glory in his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Obſervable it is, that this was the Text which <hi>Philip</hi> opened to the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch, at his Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.33. But there it is rendered as it is in the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>He was taken away from Priſon,</hi> &amp;c.] The words here in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal are very diverſly interpreted, and ſo differently expounded. But I ſhall keep to thoſe Tranſlations which we have in our Bibles. They may be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they are in the Margin; <hi>He was taken away by diſtreſs and judgment,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly refers to his being <hi>taken away</hi> by death. And then by <hi>diſtreſs</hi> muſt needs be meant, that either the unjuſt violence and oppreſſion, wherewith his Enemies proceeded againſt him without all Equity or Juſtice; or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, under which they held him until they came to execute Judgment upon him; or in general, all the miſery and anguiſh he endured in his ſufferings, whether Bodily or Spiritual. And ſo likewiſe by <hi>judgment</hi> is meant, either the pronouncing of judgment againſt him, or the executing of it upon him, or all thoſe ſevere and cruel Courſes, wherewith under a pretence of Judgment, they proceeded to puniſh him, and at laſt to take away his Life. But now read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words as they are in our Tranſlation: <hi>He was taken from Priſon and from Judgment;</hi> the moſt probable Expoſitions that are given of it may be reduced to two Heads: For, 1. Some underſtand it of his being taken from his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Tranſlated into Heavenly Glory. By <hi>Priſon</hi> none underſtand a Priſon-houſe; for in the Hiſtory of Chriſts Paſſion it is clear, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put into any ſuch Priſon: but by the word which we Tranſlate <hi>Priſon,</hi> ſome underſtand the reſtraint under which he was held after they had apprehended him, yea including his impriſonment in the Grave, where his dead Body was ſealed up and watched by a guard of Souldiers: And ſome add too, thoſe bonds of anguiſh and anxiety that were upon the Soul of our Saviour from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42788:251"/>
of Gods wrath, when in his Agony he ſweat drops of Blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. and when upon the Croſs he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Matth.</hi> 27.46. And then by <hi>Judgment</hi> they underſtand (as is before ſaid) the Judgment that was pronounced againſt him, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him. And thus they make the meaning of this firſt branch of the Verſe to be this, That he was taken from all his ſufferings, riſing again tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly out of the Grave, and then aſcending up into Heavenly Glory. But 2. Others underſtand it only of what he ſuffered from his Enemies; namely, that the intent thereof is to ſhew, either, that after they had him under reſtraint, and had pronounced ſentence of Judgment againſt him, he was <hi>taken</hi> away by death: (and ſome think too, that in the expreſſion here uſed, there is relation to his being taken up to the Croſs, according to a like expreſſion uſed elſe-where, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32.) or elſe the violence and precipitancy of their proceedings againſt him; to wit, that after they had him once under reſtraint, they preſently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away to the Judgment Seat, and when <hi>Pilate</hi> had pronounced Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, immediately, without any delay, they hurried him away to Execution; ſo that, as it is clear in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> all was done in a violent hurry; they apprehended him but over night, and he was condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the very next day. And indeed, becauſe the Prophet, both before and after theſe words ſpeaks of his ſufferings, this laſt Expoſition I judge the beſt. But then for the following words, <hi>and who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that moſt of the ancient Writers have underſtood it, either of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt of God the Father from all Eternity, as he was the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.24. or of his Conception and Birth as man, of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> without the knowledge of man. And indeed both theſe are wonderful Myſteries, which no man is able to comprehend or expreſs. But why in this place they ſhould be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is hard to conceive. And therefore the moſt of our later Expoſitors do underſtand it otherwiſe: and that three ſeveral ways. For, 1. Some by <hi>his generation</hi> do underſtand the duration, or continuance of his Life and Kingdom. (as indeed the word is ſometimes taken, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.20.) Having ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, ſay ſome, that he was from his ſufferings taken up into Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory; he adds here, expreſſing it by way of admiration; that after that, the continuance of his Age, his Life and Kingdom, would be uncountable, even unto all Eternity; it ſhould not be with him, as with them, who being delivered from Death, do yet afterwards dye again, becauſe <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dyeth no more, Death hath no more dominion over him, Rom.</hi> 6.9. Yea, and ſome extend this alſo to the Life everlaſting, of his Church and People; which indeed agreeth well with that which follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed, he ſhall prolong his days.</hi> Or, ſay others, Having in the foregoing words ſpoken of his being taken away by Death, here he adds as in oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>but who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Though he lived ſo ſhort a time, and was cut off in the flower of his age; yet who can count his age, who ſhall live and reign even unto Eternity? 2. Others by <hi>his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> underſtand the Men of that generation, wherein he lived, and ſo make the meaning of the words to be this, <hi>who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> that is,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:42788:251"/>
who is able to ſet forth the monſtrous impiety and wickedneſs of that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, that could deal thus with the Lord of Glory that came to ſave them? And, 3. Others by <hi>his generation</hi> underſtand his Spiritual Seed or Iſſue; as the word is taken <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.30. And this too is conceived to be added as in oppoſition to the foregoing branch, thus: Though he ſhall be taken away by Death; yet, oh! what an innumerable generation ſhall ſpring from him? In an ordinary way, when a man is ſlain, there is an end put to the enlarging of his Poſterity; but it ſhall not be ſo with him; no man ſhall be able to count the Spiritual generation that ſhall ſpring up to him after his Death; to wit, of thoſe that ſhall believe in him; which is that is ſaid afterwards, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> &amp;c. And then for the laſt Clauſe; <hi>for he was cut off</hi> (it is the very ſame word that is uſed concerning the death of the Meſſiah, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26.) <hi>from the Land of the Living;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my People was he ſtricken;</hi> therein a reaſon is given, why he ſhould not be quite deſtroyed by Death, but ſhould be taken up into Heavenly glory, (for, as is ſaid before, ſo ſome underſtand the firſt words of this Verſe) and ſhould live and ſee his Seed, or Generation, unto Eternity; namely, becauſe he ſhould not dye for any wickedneſs of his own, but in obedience to his Father, and that to bear the puniſhment due to the Sins of Gods People; that is, the Sins of Gods Elect People, ſay ſome; See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. Or, the <hi>Jews,</hi> amongſt others, that put him to death. And thus the Prophet might call them his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Though indeed, becauſe of thoſe words, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> many Expoſitors hold, that theſe laſt words are ſpoken in the Perſon of God the Father.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And he made his Grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his Death,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the <hi>Hebrew, in his Deaths,</hi> becauſe of his many grievous ſufferings, which were as ſo many <hi>Deaths</hi> to him; as the Apoſtle ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was in Deaths oft, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Not only becauſe he was often in danger of Death, but alſo, becauſe his Afflictions and Sufferings were as ſore and bitter as Death it ſelf. There are many Expoſitions given of theſe words, which ſeem to me extreamly forced; and ſome, which our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can by no means admit. I will only mention thoſe that may conſiſt with our Tranſlation, and which have ſome appearance of probability in them. 1. Some underſtand it of the juſt vengeance, which befell the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Crucifying of Chriſt, when they were deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans;</hi> to wit, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (or Chriſt) would bring that wicked People, even the greateſt and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them (who are particularly mentioned, becauſe ſuch being puffed up with their greatneſs and riches, are uſually moſt boldly wicked and oppreſſive of others) to be as harſhly and cruelly dealt with by others, as they had dealt with Chriſt; that he would bring them to Death, and to the Grave, as they had brought Chriſt. 2. Others underſtand it of the efficacy of Chriſts Death and Burial; namely, that thereby many wicked men; yea, many of the great and rich ones amongſt them, moſt unlikely to yield, ſhould be crucified with him, and buried with him, to wit; Spiritually; and ſo be made new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and be brought to be obedient to the will of his Father; or (which is all one in effect) that they ſhould be brought to be with him, and own him,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:42788:252"/>
though Crucified and Buried, as their Lord; and as his People, to ſubmit to his Scepter and Government. Again, 3. Some underſtand it only of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but in a ſeveral way. For, 1. Some take it thus, That God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave Chriſt over into the hands of the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even the great ones of thoſe times, ſuch as were <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> that ſo they might diſpoſe of him how they pleaſed, both in regard of his Death and Burial; which agreeth with that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.45. <hi>Behold the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners;</hi> or, (for ſo ſome would have it) that <hi>He,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People, gave him up into the hands of the wicked <hi>Gentiles, Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, that they ſhould Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie and bury him as they pleaſed. But, 2. Others underſtand it thus, that he ſhould be cut off by an untimely Death, as a wicked man, and accordingly ſhould be Executed amongſt other Malefactors in Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> the ordinary place where ſuch kind of Varlets uſed to be Executed and Buried, according to that which followeth in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>And he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſours:</hi> but yet withall, the providence of God ſo diſpoſing of it, he ſhould be buried in the Sepulchre of <hi>a rich man,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.57. the Evangeliſt thereby pointing, as ſome think, to the accompliſhment of this Prophecy. And this laſt ſeems to me the moſt probable Expoſition of this place. As for that which follows, <hi>becauſe he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his Mouth;</hi> or, as it is cited, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>neither was guile found in his Mouth,</hi> which ſeems to have ſpecial reſpect to the unqueſtionable truth of his Doctrine; it is given as a reaſon of that which went before; and therefore muſt be underſtood according to the ſeveral Expoſitions of the foregoing words; as either, 1. That God would bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon thoſe that crucified Chriſt, becauſe they had dealt ſo cruelly with an innocent man, that had never done any thing blame-worthy, either in word or deed: Or, 2. That his Death ſhould be efficacious for the Converſion of wicked Men, yea, even the greateſt and richeſt of them, becauſe he ſhould not dye for any guilt that was in him, but as a ſpotleſs Lamb, that ſuffered for the Salvation of others: Or, 3. That God would not ſuffer him to be buried amongſt thoſe notorious Malefactors, in that common place appointed for their burial in or about Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> but provided that he ſhould be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably laid in a new Sepulchre, which a rich and honourable perſon had provided for himſelf, becauſe he was ſuch a new man indeed as the World had never ſeen, a man that had never ſinned neither in word nor deed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Though there was no fault in him, yet it was the will of God that he ſhould ſuffer ſorely, to wit, becauſe he was to ſuffer for poor Sinners; See the Note before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>when thou ſhalt make his Soul an offering for Sin;</hi> that is, when thou, O God, ſhalt bring it to that, that <hi>his Soul,</hi> that is, his Life, or himſelf, ſhall be offered up as a propitiatory Sacrifice for ſinful men; Or, (as it is in the Margin) <hi>when his Soul ſhall make an offering for Sin;</hi> that is, when Chriſt ſhall willingly, even with all his Soul, offer up himſelf, as a Sacrifice for his People, to wit, in his Death; See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>he ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> that is, his Spiritual Progeny; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:42788:252"/>
of Believers, that ſhall be begotten again by his Word and Spirit. It is as if he had ſaid, that his Death ſhould not hinder his having a numerous Seed, becauſe he ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſo ſhould live and ſee his Seed; yea, it ſhould be ſo far from hindering it, that it ſhould be the cauſe of it, becauſe reconciliation being made by his Death, he ſhall thereby purchaſe them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which our Saviour intended in that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Except a Corn of Wheat fall into the ground, and dye, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much Fruit;</hi> and likewiſe becauſe it was not till after his Death and Aſcenſion into Heaven, that his Spirit was to be ſo abundantly poured forth, both upon thoſe that were to preach the Goſpel, and upon thoſe to whom it was Preached, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>he ſhall prolong his days;</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. It is ſpoken with reſpect to his reigning long over his Church upon Earth, till all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were ſubdued, and after that, together with his Church Eternally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand;</hi> that is, that which it was the Lords good will and pleaſure ſhould be done by him, to wit, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation of Men, and that which ſhould make way thereto, the bringing in of Men to believe in Chriſt, by the ſpreading of the Goſpel through all Nations; See <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.34. and 6.39.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, He ſhall for a long time together, with much content and delight, ſee and enjoy (See the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 7.7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12.) the effect and fruit of all the toilſome and weariſome pains that he had taken, and pains and ſorrows he had endured, and that eſpecially in his Soul, by reaſon of the preſſures of Divine Wrath that lay upon him, and put him into a bloody ſweat. And by this fruit of <hi>the travel of his Soul,</hi> is meant, that which in the foregoing Verſe was called, the proſpering of the pleaſure of the Lord in his hand; as namely, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of multitudes of Gods Elect People from amongſt the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that tranſcendency of Glory, whereunto himſelf ſhall be exalted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sufferings and Labours; (See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26.) and the Eternal Salvation of all his redeemed ones; <hi>and ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> to wit, with full content and delight, as having obtained that which he earneſtly thirſted after, and accounting it an abundant recompence for all his Labours and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; even as a Husband-man is ſatisfied, when after all his toil he comes to reap a plenteous Harveſt; and as a Woman is ſatisfied, when after all her pains in travel, ſhe ſees the Child ſhe hath brought forth. And indeed this doth notably ſet forth the wonderful love of Chriſt to poor Sinners, in that he is ſatisfied with their Salvation, as having therein obtained that only thing, which above all things he earneſtly deſired; <hi>by his knowledge ſhall my righteous Servant juſtifie many,</hi> that is, by their knowing him, and believing on him, according as the like expreſſions are uſed elſe-where, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>for he ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> that is, the guilt and puniſhment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; See the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Seeing he hath done me ſuch faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not ſparing to lay down his own Life, that he might bear the puniſhments due to poor Sinners, and ſatisfie my Juſtice on their behalf: <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the Spoil with the ſtrong;</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:42788:253"/>
where the ſame thing is intended in both expreſſions; only in the firſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers donation of that which is here promiſed is ſet forth, and in the ſecond the Lord Chriſts poſſeſſion and enjoyment of that which his Father had aſſigned to him. Some would have the intention of the words to be the ſame, as if it had been expreſſed thus: I will divide him great ones, or, I will divide great ones to him for a portion; and he ſhall divide him a ſpoil amongſt the ſtrong, or he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſtrong for a ſpoil. And accordingly they would have the meaning to be, either, 1. That Chriſt ſhould vanquiſh, and ſubdue, and ſpoil, all his <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> Adverſaries, Satan and the World; as the Apoſtle expreſſeth his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over the Powers of Darkneſs, at his Death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly:</hi> Or, 2. That he ſhould bring the Great Princes and Potentates of the World, and the famous wiſe and learned men that were amongſt the Nations of the World, to ſtoop and ſubmit to his Scepter: But, according to our Tranſlation, I conceive the meaning muſt needs be, That after Chriſts vanquiſhing his Enemies, he ſhould divide the ſpoil, as other great and mighty Conquerours are wont, when they have overcome their Enemies in Battel, to divide the ſpoil amongſt their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. And if we ſo underſtand the words, then by Chriſts conquered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies muſt be meant Satan, Sin, Death, and Hell, together with the wicked of the World, who were all overcome and vanquiſhed by the Death of Chriſt; and by the portion and ſpoil he ſhould have, as the effect and reward of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and Victory, may be meant; 1. And principally, The many Souls, all the World over, that ſhould be reſcued out of that Spiritual bondage, under which they lay, and brought into ſubjection to Chriſt; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. and 68.19. 2. The riches of the Kings and great ones, and the learning and wiſdom of the wiſe men of the World, who being Converted, ſhould dedicate all that they had to the ſervice of Chriſt: And 3. That tranſcendent Honour and Glory, whereto Chriſt ſhould be exalted: All which he may be ſaid to <hi>divide,</hi> in regard his Church and People are made ſharers with him in them all. And indeed there are ſome Expoſitors, that by <hi>the great</hi> and <hi>the ſtrong,</hi> with whom Chriſt divided the ſpoil, do underſtand both the Apoſtles, and others that ſhould preach the Goſpel, and likewiſe thoſe violent ones, of whom our Saviour ſpake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. that took the Kingdom of Heaven by force. As for the following words, therein the reaſon of this is further ſet forth; <hi>becauſe he hath poured out his Soul unto Death;</hi> that is, he willingly, with all his Soul, gave up himſelf to ſuffer Death for Mans Redemption, <hi>and he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors,</hi> to wit, in that they eſteemed him ſuch an one, and Accuſed him, Proſecuted, Arraigned, and Condemned him as ſuch an one; yea, the worſt of ſuch, in that they choſe rather to have <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Thief and a Murderer, to be let looſe than him; and ſo likewiſe, in that he was put to the ſame Death that Malefactors uſed to ſuffer, and in the ſame place, where ſuch were ordinarily wont to be Executed, and at the ſame time together with others; yea, in the midſt betwixt two Thieves, as the chief of Tranſgreſſors; ſo that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith expreſly, that therein this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was fulfilled, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.27, 28. <hi>and he bare the Sin of many;</hi> See the Notes before, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>and made interceſſion for the Tranſgreſſors,</hi> to wit, even

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>SIng, O barren,</hi> &amp;c.] Some conceive that this is ſpoken to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Prophet, ſay they, foreſeeing that the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that ſeemed for the preſent to be in the Eſtate of a married Wife, proſperous and comfortable, injoying Gods preſence in his Temple-worſhip, and bringing forth daily a new Generation, whom God owned for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould e're long, when they were carried Captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> be in the condition of a barren Woman, caſt off, as it were, by God, in a waſting and dying Eſtate, and not likely to bring forth a Poſterity, whom God would own for his Children; he doth here, for the comfort of the Faithful, give them a promiſe, that after this ſhe ſhould bring forth a more numerous Iſſue to God, than ever ſhe had done: Yet though this, they ſay, began to be fulfilled at the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it was not fully accompliſhed, till the days of the Goſpel. But becauſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26, 27. doth plainly cite this Prophecy, as accompliſhed in the days of the Goſpel; Jeruſalem, <hi>which is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all; for it is written,</hi> (and we muſt know, that the place is rendered, as it is in the <hi>Septuagint) Rejoyce thou bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren that beareſt not, break forth and cry, thou that travelleſt not, for the deſolate hath many mo Children, than ſhe that hath a Husband;</hi> therefore I think that others do better hold, that by the <hi>barren</hi> here is meant, the Church of the New Teſtament, conſiſting both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but primarily with reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> out of whom the firſt-Fruits of the Church of the New Teſtament were gathered, and into whoſe Body the Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ingrafted, and ſo became one Church of God, together with them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that in the following words, (wherein the reaſon is given, why ſhe is called upon to break forth into ſo great joy) <hi>for more are the Children of the deſolate, than the children of the married Wife;</hi> by <hi>the married wife,</hi> mentioned in oppoſition to her that was <hi>barren,</hi> and <hi>deſolate,</hi> is meant the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament, who was of old Gods Covenant People.

ſet at liberty by Chriſt from their ſpiritual bondage; yet queſtionleſs it is the Church of the New Teſtament, to whom the Prophet here directs his Speech. Having in the foregoing Chapter foretold the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt, and the numerous <hi>ſeed</hi> he ſhould have, notwithſtanding he ſhould be ſo cut off by Death, meaning thereby the generation of believing Converts, that ſhould joyn themſelves to him, and become his Church and People; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.10. hereupon, as in a triumphant manner, he breaks forth here into a Congratulation of this Church for her great enlargement and advancement; <hi>Sing, O barren, thou that didſt not bear, break forth into ſinging, and cry aloud thou that didſt not travel with Child;</hi> wherein, as ſhe is compared to a <hi>barren</hi> woman, and one that had not travelled with Child, that is, a woman that was not very fruitful in bringing forth Children; either with reſpect to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had been before barren, and brought forth no Children unto God, having been hitherto <hi>without God, and without Chriſt in the World, Eph.</hi> 2.12. or with reſpect to the depraved condition of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the time when Chriſt came amongſt them, when there was but a very few that were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, and ſuch as God owned for his Children, or elſe rather with reſpect to the ſmall number of thoſe that did at firſt embrace the Faith of Chriſt, upon the preaching of the Goſpel to them, it being expreſly noted, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. that immediately after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, there were but a hundred and twenty of the primitive Chriſtian Church; ſo ſhe is withall called upon to break forth into ſinging, in regard of her future fruitfulneſs: (wherein ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is an alluſion to thoſe Songs of Praiſe, which were wont to be made by barren women, when they began to be fruitful; ſuch as was that of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1.) And this is ſet forth in the following words; <hi>for more are the Children of the deſolate, than of the married Wife,</hi> that is, the Church of the New Teſtament ſhall be abundantly more numerous, by reaſon of the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than ever was the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament, yea, even whilſt ſhe continued faithful in Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Enlarge the place of thy Tent, and let them ſtretch forth the Curtains of thine Habitation,</hi> &amp;c.] This is alſo to imply the mighty encreaſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.19, 20. As for theſe expreſſions of enlarging their Tent, &amp;c. that is ſpoken in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the ancient manner of Gods People dwelling in Tents; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haply to imply, that it is the ſtate and condition of the Church and People of God, to be <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth, Heb.</hi> 11.13. and to have <hi>here no continuing City,</hi> Heb. 13.14. <hi>Spare not, lengthen thy Cords,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Spare not to lengthen thy Cords. It may imply, either that they ſhould not ſtick at, or ſcruple that to which he adviſed them, as queſtioning whether there would be any need of enlarging their Tents, but do as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them to do; or elſe, that they ſhould ſpare no pains nor coſt in the doing of it. As for the laſt words, <hi>and ſtrengthen thy ſtakes,</hi> whereby is meant, that they ſhould get ſuch ſtrong ſtakes, whereto to faſten the Cords of their Tent, and drive them ſo faſt into the ground, that they might be able to bear Curtains of ſuch length and breadth and weight, as theirs would be; this is to imply the ſtedfaſtneſs and invincible ſtability of the Chriſtian Church, for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:42788:254"/>Ver. 3. <hi>For thou ſhalt break forth on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou ſhalt be ſpread abroad amongſt all the Nations about thee on every ſide. The expreſſion here uſed of their breaking forth, is either taken from the breaking forth of Children from the Womb, according to what was ſaid of <hi>Pharez,</hi> when he was born; <hi>How haſt thou broken forth? Gen.</hi> 28.29. or elſe from the over-crowding of a Store-houſe with any Commodity; ſo that it breaks forth, and bears down the Walls before it; with reſpect whereto ſome think that expreſſion is uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.10. <hi>So ſhall thy Barnes be filled with plenty, and thy Preſſes ſhall burſt out with new Wine.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>and thy Seed ſhall inherit the</hi> Gentiles; that is, they ſhall, by the Goſpel that ſhall go forth out of <hi>Zion,</hi> bring the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into them, and to be made one Church with them under Chriſt their common Head, to whom they were promiſed for an inheritance; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>and make the deſolate Cities to be inhabited;</hi> that is, they ſhall repleniſh their Cities with a new and ſanctified people, whom God ſhall own as his Children, and who ſhall continually worſhip and ſerve the Lord their God, which lay as deſolate before as a barren Wilderneſs, where there was nothing of true Religion, nor of the knowledge of God to be found, none that owned God as their Father: Yet, in the type, I confeſs, this may be meant alſo of the <hi>Jews</hi> repoſſeſſing thoſe Cities after they returned from their Captivity, which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had ruined and left waſte and deſolate.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c.] Though in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. God by the Prophet ſpeaks to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, with reſpect to what ſhe ſhould be under the New Teſtament, when ſhe ſhould be (in thoſe firſt-Fruits of that Church that ſhould believe the Goſpel) married unto Chriſt, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied exceedingly by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet here he ſpeaks to them, as with reſpect to their preſent condition, and to aſſure them of the undoubted certainty of that which he had there foretold concerning their future Eſtate. And therefore there is no cauſe why ſome Expoſitors ſhould trouble themſelves, as they do, how that which is ſaid here ſhould be applyed to the primitive Church, eſpecially with reſpect to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For certainly this is ſpoken to thoſe, to whom this promiſe was at preſent made, concerning their future happineſs, in the primitive days of the Goſpel. <hi>Fear not;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Doubt not the accompliſhment of what I have promiſed, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any ſad and miſerable condition whereinto your ſins may hereafter bring you, which may haply incline you to look upon your ſelves as utterly caſt off by God; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.10, 14. and 44.8. <hi>for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, neither be thou confounded, for thou ſhalt not be put to ſhame;</hi> that is, wait for this which is promiſed, and thou ſhalt never be aſhamed of thy hope and expectation herein, God will in time deliver, and reſtore, and multiply thee exceedingly; or thou ſhalt not for ever continue in ſuch a reproachful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; though God may ſeem to caſt thee off for a time, yet it ſhall not be ſuch a reproachful rejection; <hi>for thou ſhalt forget the ſhame of thy Youth, and ſhalt not remember the reproach of thy Widowhood any more;</hi> that is, though thou mayeſt be for a time in a ſad deſolate condition, like a young Woman, or a Widow without a Husband, and without Children, becauſe thy God ſhall ſeem
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42788:255"/>
to have forſaken thee, and caſt thee off for thy Sins; yet the Glory and Bliſs of thy future eſtate now promiſed thee, when thou ſhalt rejoyce in Chriſt thy Husband, and in the multitude of thy Children, ſhall make thee forget all the ſhame of thy former miſeries. This, I ſay, is the whole intent of that which is here ſaid: Yet many Expoſitors do more particularly underſtand, by <hi>the ſhame of her Youth,</hi> their bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by <hi>the reproach of her Widowhood,</hi> her long Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when God ſeemed to have divorced her, and quite caſt her off; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.1. And indeed the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſets forth her miſery then under the ſame expreſſion, <hi>Lamentations</hi> 1.1. <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary, that was full of People? How is ſhe become as a Widow?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband (the Lord of Hoſts is his name) and thy Redeemer, the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for thoſe words, <hi>thy Maker;</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.1, 21. The intent of that which is ſaid here, is to aſſure the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God was their Husband, and would again own her, and live with her, as her Husband, that ſhe might be fruitful in bringing forth Children to him; <hi>the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called;</hi> that is, he ſhall be, and ſhall be owned to be the God, not of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, as the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>For the Lord hath called thee, as a Woman forſaken and grieved in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a Wife of Youth, when thou waſt refuſed</hi> &amp;c.] That is, As a man that hath put away his Wife upon ſome diſpleaſure, doth in pity relent towards her, when he ſees how ſhe is grieved, and in what a ſad and diſconſolate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe lives, and ſo takes her home to him again: So will the Lord in tender compaſſion call thee back to him, when for a time he had caſt thee off; as for thoſe words, <hi>as a Wife of Youth;</hi> ſome think they are added to imply the cauſe, why ſhe was ſo ſorely afflicted in Spirit; namely, becauſe ſhe was in the prime of her Youth, when her Husband had put her away. But I rather conceive, that theſe words are added, either to imply ſome ground of the inclinableneſs of the Husband to receive his forſaken Wife back again into favour; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe a diſpleaſure taken up againſt ſuch an one, <hi>a Wife of Youth,</hi> can hardly be perpetual and irreconcileable; or elſe to imply the entireneſs and fervency of the Husbands love to his Wife, thus received again into favour; to wit, that ſhe ſhould be moſt dear to him, as a Wife in her Youth uſeth to be; or that ſhe ſhould be as dear to him as ever ſhe had been formerly in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of her Youth; See <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, Should it be granted that I had forſaken thee, (which God never doth to his Church, though he may ſometimes hide himſelf from them) yet it was but <hi>for a ſmall moment.</hi> And indeed, though their ſeventy years Captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was a long time of miſery, yet it was but a little while, both in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4. and likewiſe in regard of that Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which God hath prepared for his People in Heaven. And indeed, obſervable it is, that the ſame may be ſaid of Mans Life, ſhould it be wholly ſpent in miſery; the ſame period being ſet to the uſual continuance of Mans
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:42788:255"/>
Life, which was ſet to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; namely, threeſcore and ten years, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>but with great mercies will I gather thee;</hi> that is, with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Mercies, and withall too of long continuance, (that ſo it may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to what was ſaid before of his forſaking them <hi>for a ſmall moment</hi>) even everlaſting mercies, as it is more fully expreſſed in the following Verſe; <hi>In a little wrath I hid my Face—but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee.</hi> And thus alſo God gives them to underſtand, that it ſhould not be with him, as it is often with men, that after reconciliation made, are colder in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than formerly, in that his mercies ſhould be greater and more firm and laſting, than ever they had been. As for this expreſſion, <hi>with great mercies will I gather thee,</hi> as it ſeems to have reſpect to the diſperſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> into ſeveral Countries in their Captivity, from whence they were to be gathered together, before they could be carried home into their own Country; ſo it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo clearly implies Gods free Grace in their reconciliation; namely, that they ſhould not return to him of themſelves, but that God out of his pity to them ſhould fetch them home.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>For this is as the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, This deluge of miſery, wherewith you will be in appearance overwhelmed and utterly ruined in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be as <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, to wit, ſuch as I will never more bring upon you: But I rather conceive that this is meant of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, whereinto God had promiſed to receive his People, whom he had ſeemed to have forſaken; namely, that this ſhould be <hi>as the Waters of</hi> Noah to him, that is, as the Covenant which God made with <hi>Noah</hi> concerning that deluge; and that, not only in regard of the inviolable ſtability of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that the Covenant which he would make with them ſhould be as firmly and certainly accompliſhed in all ſucceeding Generations, as that had been and ſhould be to the end of the World; but alſo in regard of the ſubſtance of the Covenant; becauſe as I then engaged my ſelf to <hi>Noah,</hi> that I would never drown the whole World any more, ſo my Covenant now is, that I will never bring ſuch a deluge of miſery and deſolation upon my People, as that was in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; which is ſet forth in the following words, <hi>For as I have ſworn that the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhould no more go over the Earth,</hi> (though we read not of any Oath in expreſs tearms that God ſware to <hi>Noah</hi> concerning this; yet becauſe ſolemn Covenants uſed to be confirmed by Oaths, and Gods Promiſes are as firm as any Oath can be, therefore is this expreſſion here uſed) <hi>ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee,</hi> to wit, ſay ſome, in a way of vengeance, to caſt thee off, and utterly to deſtroy thee; (See the Note, <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 6.1.) for otherwiſe God is angry with, and doth very ſharply rebuke thoſe whom he loves moſt dearly; yea, and thus not to be angry, and not to chaſtiſe men, is the greateſt wrath; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.42. Or rather, <hi>that I would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee</hi> again, ſo as it was in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This ſhall be to me as the Waters of <hi>Noah;</hi> I will never bring you into ſuch a condition any more. And indeed conſidering the deſolate and loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they were ſcattered and mingled amongſt the Nations, that they were no longer a People by themſelves, nor had any thing of the form or appearance of a Church amongſt them, we may
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:42788:256"/>
well ſay, that though the People were many times, after their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> brought into a very low and miſerable condition; yet it was never ſo with them, as it was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> no not to the coming of Chriſt; and what they have ſince endured is not to be mentioned; becauſe ſince that the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God hath been continued in the Chriſtian Church, as the <hi>Jews</hi> have been caſt off. And indeed ſome underſtand this of the Covenant which God made with the Church of the New Teſtament, that this ſhould be to God, <hi>as the Waters of</hi> Noah, namely, that he would never caſt off them from being his People, as he did the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For the Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills be removed, but my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not depart from thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, The Mountains and Hills ſhall be overturned and loſt, rather than my kindneſs towards thee ſhall fail; See the Note upon a like expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Neither ſhall the Covenant of my Peace be removed,</hi> to wit, whereby I will engage my ſelf to be at peace with thee, and to bleſs and proſper thee; which ſeems alſo to be ſaid in relation to what had been before ſpoken of Gods Covenant with <hi>Noah; ſaith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee,</hi> and therefore of his free mercy will do what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Oh thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as a Ship driven up and down with tempeſtuous Winds: (for it may well be that in theſe words there is reſpect had to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, of whom mention was made before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and which was indeed a type of the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.) or, as a poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhaken with ſtormy Winds; for that may be intended, as in oppoſition to that which is here promiſed, that this weather-beaten Cottage ſhould be a moſt glorious building; <hi>and not comforted;</hi> that is, having none to comfort thee. And this may be meant principally of their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were driven as with a tempeſt of Gods Indignation, and wherein they were ſcattered abroad, and carried from one place to another; but withall of all the miſeries they endured afterward, unto the coming of Chriſt. As for the following words, <hi>behold I will lay thy Stones with fair colours, and lay thy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations with Saphires,</hi> &amp;c. It contains a promiſe of Gods raiſing his Church, which ſhould lye for a time in ſuch a poor and ſad condition, to a ſtate of moſt tranſcendent, and almoſt incredible excellency and Glory; namely, That God would build her up like ſome ſtately coſtly Palace, or City, made up wholly in a manner of precious ſtones, under which Figurative deſcription is doubtleſs meant the ſpiritual excellency of the ſtructure of the Church of Chriſt, begun here on Earth, but perfected in Heaven; and accordingly by the Stones of this building muſt needs be meant the faithful, who as living Stones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. are built upon Chriſt, the only foundation of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Or (which is all one in effect) upon <hi>the foundation</hi> of the Doctrine <hi>of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Eph.</hi> 2.20. (whence it is that the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> are tearmed <hi>the twelve foundations</hi> of the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14.) And they are compared to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral precious Stones, with reſpect to the manifold Gifts and Graces of Gods Spirit, and the ſeveral degrees thereof, wherewith they ſhould be adorned here, and the unconceiveable Glory wherewith they ſhall be cloathed in Gods Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:42788:256"/>Ver. 12. <hi>And I will make thy Windows of Agates,</hi> &amp;c.] Some by theſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows would have the Preachers of the Goſpel meant, by whoſe teaching Gods People are enlightned; and ſo likewiſe in the following words, <hi>and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy Borders,</hi> that is, all thy Walls, wherewith thou art bounded and ſhut in, <hi>of pleaſant Stones,</hi> by her Gates and Walls they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Divine Protection. But that theſe things were particularly intended, it is hard to ſay.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Not only by the Preaching of the Goſpel outwardly (which is clearly enough hinted, in that they are called the Churches Children) but alſo by the Spirit of the Lord inwardly: For to this purpoſe is this place alledged by our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. where having ſaid that none could come unto him, except they were drawn unto him by God the Father, he adds, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> So that this is clearly a promiſe made to the Church only concerning the Elect of God, whom God had appointed to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and that too with reſpect to the time of the New Teſtament, wherein God intended to bring in more to the Church, and to give them Knowledge and Grace more abundantly than in former times, <hi>and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children,</hi> that is, their proſperity and happineſs in every regard; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.18. or their inward Spiritual Peace, yea, in the midſt of afflictions.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>In righteouſneſs ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 1. Of Gods Righteouſneſs, or Faithfulneſs, to wit, that he as a juſt and righteous God, would perform his promiſes to them, and ſo ſettle them in a peaceable and happy condition; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.5. 2. Of the ſtability of the righteouſneſs of Gods Church and People, to wit, that it ſhould be permanent and ſtable, not fluid and vaniſhing; which may be meant both of the imputed and inherent righteouſneſs of Chriſtians. Or, 3. Of the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, that ſhould be exerciſed and practiſed amongſt them, (righteouſneſs being here oppoſed to oppreſſion) to wit, that they ſhould have juſt and righteous Governours to rule over them, ſuch as were <hi>Zorababel, Joſhua, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and that the People ſhould likewiſe be juſt and righteous in their dealings, and that hereby they ſhould be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as upon a ſure foundation, in a good and happy condition: <hi>thou ſhalt be far from oppreſſion, for thou ſhalt not fear; and from terrour; for it ſhall not come near thee;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be ſo far from being oppreſſed, that there ſhall be no cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt fear it, to wit, either becauſe thy Children ſhall do all things righteouſly and ſhall not in the leaſt wrong one another; or becauſe God will deſtroy thoſe that ſeek to oppreſs thee, or will at leaſt protect you from their rage; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.] God having in the foregoing Verſe promiſed his Church a peaceable and proſperous condition, that they might not from hence fancy, that they ſhould meet with no more trouble in the World, here he tells them, that they ſhould have many Enemies, that ſhould be ever and anon conſpiring and bandying againſt them, only God would protect them: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they ſhall ſurely gather together,</hi> to wit, to do thee all the miſchief they
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42788:257"/>
are able, <hi>but not by me;</hi> that is, I ſhall not be with them to proſper them; and ſo whatſoever they attempt ſhall be in vain and to no purpoſe; <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall gather together againſt thee, ſhall fall for thy ſake;</hi> that is, they ſhall be deſtroyed, that thou mayeſt be preſerved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Behold, I have created the Smith that bloweth the Coals in the Fire, and that bringeth forth an inſtrument for his work,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, His ſeveral Tools wherewith he is to make thoſe warlike Weapons, in the forging and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof he is uſually imployed; <hi>and I have created the Waſter to deſtroy,</hi> to wit, thoſe whom I intend to puniſh for their Sins. The drift of the whole Verſe is to ſhew, that ſeeing the Smith that makes the Arms and Weapons of War, and the Souldier, here called <hi>the Waſter,</hi> that uſeth them, are both Gods Creatures, they muſt needs be in his power, and ordered and diſpoſed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, and conſequently that they can do nothing without his leave, or otherwiſe than according to his appointment: ſo that neither can a Sword, or any other Weapon of War be made, to be uſed againſt his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if he be pleaſed to hinder it: nor can any body make uſe of any Weapon againſt them without a Commiſſion from him; and therefore as long as his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were under his protection, they need not fear any thing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>No Weapon that is formed againſt thee, ſhall proſper,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, For the effecting of that which your Enemies intend, namely, the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of you my Church and People; <hi>and every Tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgment;</hi> that is, every Perſon, that ſhall appear in a judicial way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee faſly to accuſe thee, and to ſeek thy ruin; <hi>thou ſhalt condemn,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt ſo clear thine innocency, and convince him of his wickedneſs, in charging thee faſly, that he ſhall be aſhamed and confounded in himſelf, and withall ſentenced and condemned in Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, This is that which God will allot to be the certain portion and reward of his righteous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and which ſhall as an heritage be aſſured to them in all ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. And this may be meant, either in general of all the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Gods Church and People, in the foregoing part of this Chapter: Or elſe more particularly that which was mentioned in the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoing, namely, That God would protect them againſt all the open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and againſt all the cunning falſe accuſations of their Enemies; <hi>and their righteouſneſs is of me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> where by <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> may be meant, either, 1. The bleſſings which ſhould be by God conferred upon his People, which may be called <hi>their righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe they ſhould, be beſtowed as the reward of their righteouſneſs: Or elſe, 2. (as with reſpect to that foregoing promiſe, that they ſhould condemn every Tongue that ſhould riſe in judgment againſt them) it may be meant of both the righteouſneſs of their Perſons and Lives, and the clearing and vindicating of their righteouſneſs from the falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Enemies, to wit, that they both were from God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>HO every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter foretold the exceeding great happineſs of the Church of Chriſt; here God, <hi>the Fountain of living Waters, Jer.</hi> 2.13. calleth and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth poor Sinners to come in and accept of thoſe precious benefits, which in Chriſt were there promiſed to his Church and People. And in the manner of ſpeech here uſed, there ſeems to be an alluſion to the cuſtom of crying in the Streets of a City, the ſeveral proviſions that are to be ſold in ſuch and ſuch places, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> &amp;c. For the underſtanding whereof, we muſt know, 1. That by <hi>every one that thirſteth</hi> (under which hunger alſo is comprehended, as appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>come ye, buy and eat,</hi> though thirſt be only mentioned as the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and inſufferable deſire of the twain) is meant every one that thirſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter true happineſs; or more expreſly, all thoſe that being convinced of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſerable condition by Nature, are extreamly afflicted therewith, and do thereupon vehemently deſire reconciliation with God, comfort and Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and whatever may tend to the ſatisfying of theſe wants and deſires of their Souls. So that it is clear, that thoſe that are full, fully ſatisfied with their own righteouſneſs, and deſiring no other, or fully glutted with earthly things, ſo as never to mind any thing better, cannot be the Perſons that are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; becauſe ſuch will never mind that Spiritual refreſhing that is here tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being like thoſe that are ſo puffed up with Wind, that though they want nouriſhment, yet they have no Stomach to eat any thing: 2. That by <hi>the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> to which they are here invited, (and ſo likewiſe the <hi>Wine and Milk</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> afterward mentioned) is meant, that ſuperabundant Grace which is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Church, in the days of the New Teſtament, above what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed formerly; namely, Chriſt held forth to Men in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, as having accompliſhed the work of Mans Redemption, together with all the gifts and precious benefits, which he hath purchaſed for poor Sinners, his merits and righteouſneſs, the ſanctifying Graces of his Spirit, and in a word, all things tending to the Spiritual Life, the comfort and ſatisfying of the deſires of Mens Souls here, and to their Eternal Life and Salvation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.3. and 41.17, 18. See alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. 3. That by coming to theſe Waters is meant, the poor Sinners ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and imbracing of Chriſt by a true and a lively Faith, together with all the precious benefits, that are tendered in Chriſt: For ſo is this explained by Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> 4. That by theſe words, <hi>And he that hath no Money; come
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:42788:258"/>
ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without price,</hi> to wit, any thing given in exchange for them, inſtead of Money; I ſay, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not ſo much meant, as I conceive, that the Poor are invited to come as well as the Rich; as that all are invited to come freely, and to accept of that Mercy and Life that is tendered in Chriſt, though they are nothing, though they have nothing, and can do nothing towards the obtaining of this bliſs and happineſs, even thoſe that are moſt ſenſible of their Spiritual Poverty and Indigency in this regard. The ſame that was before meant by coming to the Waters, is here again meant by buying Wine and Milk, only it is expreſſed by theſe other kinds of Food, to imply the ſweet and comfortable refreſhing that Men ſhall find in this Spiritual Food; and that all good that Sinners can want or deſire, is to be had in Chriſt, and that there is proviſion for all ſorts of People; Milk for Children, and Wine for thoſe that are of grown years; yea, and that they ſhall have as ſure an intereſt in what is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without Money and without Price, as if they had bought it. And, 5. That by the frequent repeating and urging of this Invitation is implyed, both Mens backwardneſs in accepting the Grace here tendered them, and Gods earneſtneſs that they ſhould be perſwaded and won to accept it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That which is not true Food; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1. <hi>and your labour,</hi> that is, the Money you have gotten by your labour, <hi>for that which ſatisfieth not,</hi> that is, that which will neither aſſwage your hunger, nor nouriſh you, and cauſe you to live. It is, as if he had ſaid, Why do you ſo eagerly purſue, ſparing neither coſt nor labour, that which will no way profit you? that is, that which will afford no furtherance for the obtaining of that Soul-ſatisfying bliſs and happineſs, which in Chriſt is tendered to you: And hereby is meant, 1. The greedy purſuit of the things of the World, which a Man is not ſure to obtain, and cannot long hope to enjoy, and which whilſt he doth enjoy them, cannot ſatisfie the thirſt and deſires of his Soul, nor make him happy. 2. All ſtrictneſs and diligence in falſe ſuperſtitious Will-worſhips, which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to diſpleaſure inſtead of pleaſing him, and were never like to bring them to Life Eternal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. And, 3. All falſe Doctrines, concerning the way of attaining Gods favour here, and Eternal Life and Happineſs; ſuch as that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of Mens being ſaved by their own works and righteouſneſs; See <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Hearken diligently unto me,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, And by a conſtant obſerving the direction of my word, you ſhall be ſure to prevent all ſuch miſtakes, <hi>and eat you that which is good,</hi> that is, that which is really good, that which is Bread indeed, that which will indeed procure Gods Love and Favour, comfort you here and preſerve you unto Life Eternal, <hi>and let your Soul delight it ſelf in fatneſs;</hi> that is, you ſhall have abundance of the choiceſt and chiefeſt good, even that which will fully delight and ſatisfie your So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Incline your Ear, and come unto me,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10. <hi>hear, and your Souls ſhall live,</hi> See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. <hi>and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you,</hi> wherein is implyed. 1. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and confirming of that Covenant of Grace, which God had made
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:42788:258"/>
with their Fathers, in and through the Lord Chriſt; which was, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, an <hi>everlaſting Covenant;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Though you have on your part broken Covenant with me, and though in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I may ſeem to have caſt you off, and the Kingdom ſetled upon <hi>Davids</hi> Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may ſeem to be utterly ruined, yet fear not, I will renew and confirm that my Covenant with you. And, 2. The making of a new Covenant with them, to wit, the Covenant of the New Teſtament, confirmed with the blood of Chriſt, which though it were the ſame in ſubſtance, with that which God made with his People under the Old Teſtament, yet it was a new Covenant, in regard of the new manner of the diſpenſation of it many ways, and may be here called <hi>an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> in oppoſition to that which was before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to continue for ever, and not to be abrogated, as that which God made with the <hi>Jews</hi> was. As for the following words, <hi>even the ſure Mercies of</hi> David; ſome, by <hi>David,</hi> here underſtand Chriſt; as he is elſewhere called, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.25. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. becauſe he was that Meſſiah, whom God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed of the ſeed of <hi>David;</hi> and accordingly, by <hi>the ſure Mercies of</hi> David, they underſtand thoſe ſtable Mercies which God had promiſed and covenanted, in and through the Lord Chriſt, the Mediator of the Covenant (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.18.) to confer upon his People. But again, others underſtand it of King <hi>David;</hi> and ſo by <hi>the ſure Mercies of</hi> David they underſtand, either Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ſhould as ſurely be performed to his People, as thoſe were for which he had engaged himſelf by Covenant to <hi>David,</hi> or elſe, rather the very Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which he had promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> and in and through him, as the Father and Type of Chriſt, unto his Church and People; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. &amp;c. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.4, 35, &amp;c. namely, that God would give unto <hi>David</hi> a Son that ſhould ſave his People, and that ſhould reign over them for ever. And hence it was that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alledged this place to prove the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34. <hi>And as concerning that he raiſed him up from the Dead, now no more to return to Corruption, he ſaid on this wiſe, I will give you the ſure Mercies of</hi> David. For the Promiſe made to Chriſt, or to <hi>David</hi> concerning Chriſt, the Eternity of his Kingdom, and the Mercies he ſhould procure for his People, could not have taken effect, if after he was Crucified he had not been raiſed again from the dead.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Behold, I have given him,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, Chriſt (See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6.] who in the foregoing Verſe was called <hi>David,</hi> or at leaſt intended as the Son and Succeſſour of <hi>David,</hi> the Mediator of the Covenant, the Mercies whereof are there called <hi>the ſure Mercies of</hi> David: I, ſaith God the Father, have ordained him <hi>for a witneſs to the People;</hi> that is, to make known, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the Counſel of God, concerning Mans Salvation, and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing what God had foretold ſhould be, to teſtifie and make good the Faithfulneſs of God: Whence was that of our Saviour to <hi>Pilate? To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the World, that I ſhould bear Witneſs unto the Truth,</hi> Joh. 18.37. <hi>A leader and commander to the People;</hi> that is, one that is to lead them in the way of Life, both by his Doctrine and Example, and whoſe commands, upon pain of Eternal Damnation, all men are bound to obey, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:42788:259"/>Ver. 5. <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou knoweſt not,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thou, O Chriſt, (for he it is that was ſpoken of in the foregoing Verſe) ſhalt effectually call in thoſe Nations to believe in thee, whom formerly thou didſt not own for thy People, nor didſt regard, or take any notice of, to wit, the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And indeed this is that which <hi>David</hi> did long before ſay of himſelf, as he was a type of Chriſt, <hi>a People whom I have not known ſhall ſerve me,</hi> Pſal. 18.43. <hi>and Nations that knew not thee,</hi> that is, that had never heard of thee, and ſo had no knowledge of thee, but lived without God and without Chriſt in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>ſhall run unto thee;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2. <hi>becauſe of the Lord thy God, and for the holy one of</hi> Iſrael; that is, becauſe the Lord thy God (which is ſpoken of Chriſt, with reſpect to his humane Nature) ſhall clearly manifeſt himſelf to be thy God, and thy Father, and ſhall make thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry effectual, by convincing the Nations, that thou art true and very God, the Son of God ſent to ſave Sinners; <hi>for he hath glorified thee,</hi> to wit, by the miraculous paſſages at his Birth and Baptiſm, by his tranſcendent holineſs, and the Miracles that were wrought by him and his, and eſpecially after his Paſſion by his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, whereby the Nations were brought in to own Chriſt to be the only begotten Son of God, and Saviour of the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] The exhortation in the beginning of this Chapter is here further preſſed by the Prophet, namely, that Men ſhould dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek after that Grace and Reconciliation with God, which was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to them in Jeſus Chriſt: (Some would have it underſtood as ſpoken to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> only, of whom the Prophet had ſpoken in the foregoing Verſe; others as ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> by way of preſſing them to come in by the example of the forwardneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before mentioned. But it is rather generally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to all loſt and miſerable Sinners) <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found,</hi> that is, immediately and without delay, whilſt yet Mercy and Pardon is tendered to you in the means of Grace, and God doth yet by his Spirit move you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>call ye upon him while he is near;</hi> that is, whilſt he is near in the means and offers of Grace. But See the Notes alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added to ſhew, that though Reconciliation be freely tendered in Chriſt to the worſt of Sinners; yet it is tendered upon condition of unfeigned Repentance, and that without that no favour can be expected from God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts,</hi> &amp;c.] God having promiſed in the cloſe of the foregoing Verſe, that he would have Mercy on true Penitents, that would forſake their Sins and return to him, and that he would abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon them; leſt poor dejected Sinners ſhould ſcruple this, as judging of God according to what is uſual amongſt men, here he puts them in mind of the infinite diſproportion that is betwixt God and Man, <hi>for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is my thoughts and ways of pardoning and ſhewing mercy to Sinners, muſt not be meaſured by the thoughts and ways of mercy that are in men, towards thoſe that have offended them. 1. Men are many times inexorable: And, 2. Eſpecially in injuries of a higher Nature; And, 3. At leaſt they are hardly won to be reconciled, and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:42788:259"/>
will often have ſome conſiderable compenſation for the wrongs done them. And, 4. Their Reconciliations are ſeldom ſincere and perfect. And, 5. Though they be, yet through ſickleneſs they are in danger to repent of their Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, and to revive their old Quarrels. But now in all theſe it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with God; See <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.21. I know ſome do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtand theſe words: For they conceive that therein there is a reaſon given, why Sinners muſt abandon their former thoughts and ways, if they deſired that God ſhould be at peace with them; namely, becauſe their thoughts and ways were not Gods thoughts and ways; that is, ſuch as God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their ways and thoughts ſhould be; or, becauſe there was ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwixt Gods thoughts and ways, which were all infinitely holy and juſt, and theirs that were ſo exceedingly ſinful and wicked. But this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot conſiſt with the following Verſe, whereby it is clear, that the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of Gods Mercy above Mans is here intended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Incomprehenſibly higher; See the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11. The diſtance betwixt Heaven and Earth doth not fully parallel the diſtance that is betwixt the Mercies of God and Man, becauſe Gods Mercies are infinite; but this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerves to ſet forth, that Gods Mercies are wonderful, far above Mans. One Man may exceed others in pity and tender compaſſion and readineſs to pardon Injuries, as far as the Mountains are above the Dales; but the higheſt Heavens are not ſo far above the Center of the Earth, as Gods Mercies are above all the Bowels of Mercy, that can be imaginably in the moſt merciful Men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For as the Rain,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the Lord makes good what he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning the greatneſs of his Mercy, by aſſuring them of the certainty of what he had promiſed them: <hi>For as the Rain cometh down, and the Snown from Heaven, and returneth not thither;</hi> to wit, without effecting that for which they were ſent by the God of Heaven; <hi>but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the Sower and Bread to the Eater;</hi> that is, that it may yield Men, not only plenty of Bread for food, but alſo ſufficient Seed for the following year. It is true that the Rain and Snow may in ſome Senſe be ſaid to return again to the Heavens, in the Vapours which from them are exhaled by the Sun, or blown up by the Winds, and ſo carried up into the Clouds. But this expreſſion here, of the Rain and the Snows, not returning again, intends no more, but that they never fail of effecting that for which pleas'd to ſhowr them down upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>So ſhall my word be that goeth forth out of my Mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Every word which my Prophets ſhall deliver truly from me. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this is ſpoken here with particular reſpect to that promiſe which God had made them concerning their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt ſignified thereby, and more eſpecially, that above, Ver. 7. concerning his pardoning penitent Sinners; <hi>it ſhall not return unto me void,</hi> &amp;c. that is, without effecting what I have ſaid ſhall be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:42788:260"/>Ver. 12. <hi>For ye ſhall go out with joy,</hi> &amp;c.] This is mentioned as the word of promiſe, of which he had ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, that it ſhould not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn void,</hi> but ſhould ſurely be accompliſhed; for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.11. <hi>and ye ſhall be led forth with peace,</hi> that is, ye ſhall be led along from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Judea</hi> peaceably and quietly; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.11. under which alſo may be intended myſtically, that inward Peace which Chriſtians ſhould enjoy in their paſſage to Heaven. And there ſeems alſo to be an alluſion in the words, to the leading of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by a Pillar of Cloud, as they went through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan: The Mountains and the Hills ſhall break forth before you into ſinging, and all the Trees of the Fields ſhall clap their Hands;</hi> that is, they ſhall rejoyce at your joy and welfare; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1. and 44.23. and 49. Yet there may be an Alluſion alſo in the words to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ringing with, and ecchoing back the joyful ſhouting and ſinging of Gods People; and to the pleaſant noiſe made in the Arms, the Branches and Twigs of the Trees, by the ſweet gales of Wind, which God ſhould ſend for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of his People as they went along.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Inſtead of the Thorn ſhall come up the Firr-Tree, and inſtead of the Briar ſhall come up the Myrtle-Tree,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of Gods making the way of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their return homeward from <hi>Babylon</hi> convenient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and that they ſhould meet with nothing that ſhould be any an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance or hindrance to them, even as they ſhould go through thoſe vaſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Deſarts that lay in their way. And ſo they make this parallel with that <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.19. for which ſee the Note there. But then others again underſtand it, and I think better, of the mighty change that ſhould be in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> at their return thither. Having, ſay they, aſſured the <hi>Jews,</hi> that their return ſhould be ſafe and peaceable and comfortable; here the Prophet adds, That though their Land had ſo many years in their abſence lain deſolate, over-grown with Briars and Thorns for want of People to till the Ground; yet at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home it ſhould be exceeding fruitful, abounding with all uſeful and pleaſant Trees and Plants; and that the Face of their Country and State ſhould be every way changed for the better. But for this, and how it may be alſo underſtood ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually of the great change that ſhould be wrought amongſt Chriſts redeemed ones, in the days of the Goſpel, whereof their return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a type; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. and 35.1, 2. and 49.11. <hi>and it ſhall be to the Lord for a name;</hi> that is, this deliverance and reſtitution of his Church and People, and this glorious change, that ſhall be wrought amongſt them, ſhall bring much Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, <hi>for an everlaſting Sign, that ſhall not be cut off;</hi> that is, it ſhall be an Everlaſting monument of his glorious Power and Goodneſs to his People, by means whereof the Lord ſhall be for ever praiſed, and his People ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their confidence that God will never forſake them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>TH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ſaith the Lord, keep ye Judgment and do Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Do you all, Judges and others, that which is exactly juſt and right. The exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to repentance, begun in the former <hi>Chapter, Ver.</hi> 6, 7. is farther here preſſed: <hi>For my Salvation is near to come, and my righteouſneſs to be revealed;</hi> See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 46.13. and 51.51. It is the ſame in effect with that which the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preached, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2. and Chriſt alſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>The Kingdom of God is at Hand; repent ye and believe the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that doth this,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That keepeth Judgment and doth Juſtice, as was ſaid in the foregoing Verſe; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. <hi>and the Son of Man that layeth hold on it;</hi> that is, that doth zealouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly keep cloſe to the doing of this; <hi>that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it;</hi> that is, that is careful to worſhip God, as he hath appointed them: for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Sabbath, is here put for the exerciſing of all the Duties of Religion and Piety; and that haply the rather, becauſe this they might obſerve in their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereas many other parts of Gods Worſhip were only to be performed in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem; and keepeth his hand from doing any evil;</hi> to wit, to his Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Neither let the Son of the Stranger, that hath joined himſelf to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Let not any Gentile, that by Faith in Chriſt hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to my Church and People; <hi>Speak, ſaying, The Lord hath utterly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me from his People;</hi> to wit, becauſe I am as an Alien and a Stranger, and not of the Stock of the <hi>Jews; neither let the Eunuch ſay, Behold I am a dry Tree;</hi> that is, like a dry Tree, barren and without poſſibility of Iſſue. Becauſe by that Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.1. &amp;c. (for which ſee the Notes there) an Eunuch, and Proſelytes that came in from other Nations, and joyned themſelves to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were debarred from being admitted into full communion with the Common-wealth and Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> left therefore the Eunuchs, or Heathens ſhould think, that ſurely they ſhould not have any ſhare in the Priviledges here promiſed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that were born of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had not any ſuch Note of Infamy upon them; (and indeed we ſee how exceedingly even the believing <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at the taking in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.45. and 11.2, 3.) therefore the Lord doth here aſſure them, that in the days of the Goſpel, of which he had ſpoken, there ſhould be no ſuch diſtinction betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> betwixt Perſon and Perſon, but that thoſe that ſeemed moſt vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible if they came into Chriſt, ſhould be admitted to the ſame Priviledges with the reſt of his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:42788:261"/>Ver. 4. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver</hi> 2. <hi>and chuſe the things that pleaſe me;</hi> that is, that upon Judgment rightly informed do ſincerely ſet themſelves to do thoſe things that I have commanded them, (for both Will-worſhips, and Hypocriſie are hereby excluded) <hi>and take hold of my Covenant;</hi> that is, that do imbrace the mercy tendered to them in my Covenant of Grace, and carefully obſerve to do thoſe things that by their Covenant with me they are bound to do, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn their profeſſion of Chriſtianity with a holy Converſation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Even unto them will I give in my Houſe, and within my Walls,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, within the Walls of my Houſe, the Temple; or, within my Temple, and my City <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But however, both by the one and the other is meant the Church of Chriſt, whereof both the Temple and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Types: For that which is intended, is, that unto thoſe Eunuchs, before mentioned, God would give in his Church here, and afterward in Heaven, <hi>a place and a Name, better than of Sons and Daughters;</hi> that is, of greater Honour and Dignity, than that which accrews to them that have Sons and Daughters, which is accounted a great Honour and Happineſs to Men (See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.6.) and in whom their Name is continued when they are dead; namely, that of being Gods peculiar People, his adopted Children, a Name more glorious and more durable, even that which ſhall continue unto Eternity, as is expreſſed in the following Words, <hi>I will give them an everlaſting Name, that ſhall not be cut off;</hi> to wit, as the continuance of Mens Names in their Poſterity many times is.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Alſo the Sons of the Stranger that joyn themſelves to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>to ſerve him, and to love the Name of the Lord, to be his Servants;</hi> to wit, as counting it an honour to ſerve him, becauſe of the great love they bare to him; <hi>every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my Covenant;</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Even them will I bring to my holy Mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will cauſe them to come in, and joyn themſelves to my Church; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2. <hi>and make them joyful in my houſe of Prayer;</hi> to wit, my Church, of which the Temple was a Type. And the meaning is, that their Hearts ſhould be joyed by the conſideration of their happineſs in being admitted to be Gods People, and to all the Glorious priviledges, which thereby they ſhould enjoy, by the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their troubled Conſciences, with the glad tydings of the Goſpel, which ſhould be there preached to them, and more particularly, by the ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing comforts they ſhould find in their Souls, both whilſt they were praying, and after they had prayed, and the gracious anſwers God ſhould return to their prayers; <hi>their burnt offerings and their Sacrifices ſhall be accepted upon mine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;</hi> that is, their Spiritual and <hi>Evangelical</hi> Sacrifices (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.) ſhall be <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>for mine Houſe;</hi> that is, my Church, <hi>ſhall be called the Houſe of Prayer, for all People;</hi> to wit, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews;</hi> yet becauſe the Church of Chriſt is called Gods Houſe in alluſion to its Type, the Temple, therefore our Saviour cites this place, as ſpoken of the Temple, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:42788:261"/>Ver. 8. <hi>The Lord God which gathereth together the out-caſts of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and other Countries, where they were ſcattered; See the Note <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.2. <hi>yet will I gather others to him;</hi> that is, to <hi>Iſrael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that are gathered to him;</hi> that is, that are already gathered to him out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And it is meant of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom after this would God bring in, and make them one Church and People with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.51, 52.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>All ye Beaſts of the Field, come to devour,</hi> &amp;c.] Very many Learned Expoſitors hold this to be the beginning of a new Prophecy: But if we take it as a part of the foregoing Prophecy (as indeed, according to the diviſion of the Chapters in our Bibles, it ſeems to be joined with that) then we may conceive the connexion to be either, 1. That having cheared up the Godly with many precious Promiſes in the foregoing part of the Prophecy, here he turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reprove the wicked party amongſt them; and that the rather, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be put in mind, that the comfort of the foregoing promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd not to them: Or, 2. That having made Gods People ſo many glorious Promiſes, he now ſhews them, that before they ſhould be fulfilled, very ſad havock ſhould be made in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, by forreign Nations, that ſo the Godly might not be ſtumbled, when they ſaw ſuch ſad things, ſo contrary to what was now promiſed, to come upon them, but might only be ſtirred up by unfeigned Repentance to approve themſelves to God: And it may be alſo there might be an intention to give ſome light to that which he had ſaid of <hi>the out-caſts of</hi> Iſrael. As for the words themſelves, <hi>All ye Beaſts of the Field, come to devour, yea, all the Beaſts of the Forreſt;</hi> though they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood literally, as an invitation of all kinds of Beaſts of Prey, to come and devour the Carcaſes of Gods ſlaughtered People, intended to imply, that there ſhould be ſuch multitudes of them ſlain by their Enemies, that there ſhould be enough to ſatisfie all the Beaſts, both of Field and Forreſt, that would come in to devour: Yet I rather think, that by theſe ravenous Beaſts are figuratively meant thoſe barbarous cruel Nations, that ſhould deſtroy and devour Gods People; and that becauſe in the following Verſes, the blindneſs and neglect of the Shepherds is alledged, as a motive to encourage them to come in and devour Gods Flock. Many I know, and I think moſt probably, do underſtand this particularly of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the many Nations that joyned with them in their invaſion of <hi>Judea;</hi> but yet it may well be extended to all that were after this called in at ſeveral times to devour the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Babylonians, Grecians, Romans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>His watchmen are blind,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, <hi>Iſraels</hi> Rulers, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical (the two Eyes of a Church or State) her Prieſts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prophets and Teachers eſpecially, are blind Seers, ſuch as could not foreſee approaching Evils and Judgments, that they might forewarn the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them, being ignorant and ſottiſh, as the following words explain it; <hi>they are all ignorant;</hi> that is, all of them, in a manner, are ignorant, as to the Law of God and their own Duty; they know not how to teach and govern the People; ſuch as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were in our Saviours time; <hi>blind leaders of the blind; they are all dumb Dogs, they cannot bark;</hi> to wit, by oppoſing the Evil of the Times, reproving Evil doers, and forewarning them of the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:42788:262"/>
Judgments they were like to bring upon themſelves, and that becauſe they were ignorant, given to the Vices they ſhould have reproved in others, nor willing by doing their duty, to expoſe themſelves to the diſpleaſure of Men, eſpecially the great ones of the Times; in all which there is an alluſian to Houſe-Dogs, or Shepherds Dogs, that are by barking to drive away Thieves and Wolves, and waken thoſe that ſhould help to drive them away; <hi>ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber;</hi> that is, delighting in ſloth and ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and giving up themſelves thereto. The word indeed which we Tranſlate <hi>ſleeping,</hi> is by ſome rendered, as it is in the Margin, <hi>dreaming,</hi> or <hi>talking in their ſleep,</hi> with reference, as I conceive, to the vain things they vented, when they did at any time undertake to teach the People, even their own Dreams, and not any thing which God had given them in charge: However, upon theſe men we muſt know the blame is particularly laid, not becauſe the People were not alſo extreamly wicked, but becauſe the neglect of their Duty was a main cauſe of the wickedneſs of the People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Yea, they are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be added as another of their Sins, to wit, their inſatiable Covetouſneſs; or elſe as a reaſon of that which was ſaid before of them; namely, That they were blinded with Covetouſneſs; <hi>and they are Shepherds that cannot underſtand;</hi> that is, they know not how to order their Flocks aright; ſee the foregoing Note, <hi>they all look to their own way;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, they all give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do, every Man of them, what they liſt; or rather, they are all for themſelves, minding only their own affairs and profit, <hi>every one for his gain from his Quarter;</hi> that is, every one from the place of his abode, even all the City over, from one end to the other.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink,</hi> &amp;c.] This is another Sin, wherewith their Watch-men before mentioned are here charged; to wit, Their Rioting and Drunkenneſs. And they are brought in here, enticing to, and encouraging one another in this Sin, and perhaps the People: too, to imply their obſtinacy and ſecurity herein; <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch Wine,</hi> &amp;c. as if they had ſaid, Let Men ſay what they will, and come what will of it, we will thus take our Pleaſure: And ſo likewiſe in the following words, <hi>and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant;</hi> which do clearly hold forth a bold and deſperate reſolution of running on in this their exceſs day after day; though they may alſo imply a ſcornful contempt of the threatnings of Gods Prophets; as if they had ſaid, Come, let us drink ſtoutly, and fear nothing; if it be well with us to day, it ſhall be as well with us to morrow, and, it may be, better.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THE Righteous periſheth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, They dye, (it is ſpoken accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is outwardly ſeen in the Death of Men) <hi>and no Man layeth it to Heart;</hi> that is, no man minds it, or is troubled at it; though it be an uſual ſign of ſome approaching Judgment, when thoſe that are the Pillars to ſupport a Church are taken away; <hi>and merciful men</hi> (or Godly Men; for the Word in the Original ſignifieth both) <hi>are taken away;</hi> to wit, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or a violent Death, (for ſome think it is ſpoken with reſpect to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous that were cut off by <hi>Manaſſah;</hi> ſee the Note 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.16.) <hi>none conſidering that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come;</hi> to wit, as Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen make ſpeed to Houſe their Corn when they ſee ſtorms coming. So it was with <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. This therefore is another wickedneſs, wherewith he chargeth, not their Watch-men only, as before in the cloſe of the foregoing Chapter, but the whole People in general; namely, That whereas many, it ſeems, of the Faithful Servants of God were at that time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, they regarded not this warning which God gave them of thoſe dreadful Judgments that were coming apace upon them: But withall there is comfort hinted for the deſpiſed Righteous.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>He ſhall enter into Peace,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, into the reſt and peace of Heavenly Glory, where they ſhall be with God, perfectly freed from all the troubles of the World. It may indeed be read, as in the Margin, <hi>He ſhall go in peace,</hi> and then the meaning may be, that they ſhould go out of the World with quiet and peaceable Conſciences, and before thoſe evil and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome times came, of which he had ſpoken in the foregoing Verſe; <hi>they ſhall reſt in their Beds;</hi> that is, in their Graves, (for as Death is called a ſleep, ſo the Graves are termed Beds, wherein dead men lye aſleep until the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſurrection, when they ſhall all awake and riſe again) their Souls being departed into Heavenly reſt, their Bodies ſhall reſt quietly in their Graves; ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 3.13. <hi>each one walking in his own uprightneſs,</hi> or <hi>before him,</hi> as it is in the Margin. The meaning is, that thus it ſhall be with every one that ſerves God ſincerely; ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>But,</hi> &amp;c.] Having, in the foregoing Verſes, touched upon the happineſs of the Righteous, that were by Death taken away from approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments; here he turns his Speech to the wicked Wretches of that Generation, that rejoiced in their Death, rather than grieved for it; and triumphed in their ſurviving of them, and condemns and threatens them. <hi>But draw near hither, ye Sons of the Sorcereſs, the Seed of ye Adulterer, and of the Where;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Thus ſhall it be with my Righteous Servants
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:42788:263"/>
that are cut off from amongſt you; but as for you, the prophane Crew that ſurvive them, and applaud your ſelves herein, draw near and hear your doom. And he calls them <hi>Sons of the Sorcereſs,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was much addicted to thoſe wicked Arts; <hi>and the Seed of the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer and the Whore,</hi> becauſe the Inhabitants of that City were alſo much given to thoſe Sins of uncleanneſs, but eſpecially to that Sin of Idolatry, which is often in the Scripture tearmed Spiritual Adultery and Fornication; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.22. And thus theſe tearms implyed, that they were a Wicked and Idolatrous Generation, deſcended from Wicked and Idolatrous Parents, both by Fathers and Mothers ſide; and eſpecially that they were no more in Truth the Seed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or Children of God, than the Children which a Wife hath by an Adulterer are her Husbands Children.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Againſt whom do ye ſport your ſelves?</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, When you make your ſelves merry with flouting and jeering at the reproof and threatnings of my Prophets, (conſider well of it) it is not poor mortal Men againſt whom you ſport your ſelves, but the immortal and mighty God of Heaven and Earth, whoſe Servants they are, and whoſe Word it is, which they Preach to you; ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. for that this is here intended, is evident by the following words; <hi>againſt whom make ye a wide Mouth?</hi> to wit, in a way of deriſion; ſee the Notes; <hi>Job.</hi> 16.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7. <hi>and draw out the Tongue?</hi> which was another geſture uſed of old by way of mocking, as we ſee by that of <hi>Perſius; Nec linguae, quartum ſitiat canis Appela tantum; Are ye not Children of Tranſgreſſion?</hi> That is, ſay ſome, born of Wicked Rebellious Parents, as was ſaid before, <hi>Children of the Adulterer and the Whore;</hi> or rather, Children that are tranſgreſſors, as <hi>Children of Iniquity, Hoſ.</hi> 10.9. Children given to tranſgreſſion and rebellion againſt God, brought up in ways of diſobedience, and ſo juſt ſuch as your Parents, have been before you, <hi>a ſeed of falſhood;</hi> that is, given to a falſe Religion; or rather, a degenerate Seed; ſuch as profeſs your ſelves to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Children of God, when ye are nothing ſo; <hi>Are ye not Children of tranſgreſſion, a ſeed of falſhood?</hi> as if he had ſaid, you ſee it was not without cauſe that I called you <hi>the ſeed of the Adulterer and the Whore;</hi> that which I have now ſaid proves it to be ſo; deny it if you can.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Enflaming your ſelves with Idols,</hi> &amp;c.] Some read this, as it is in the Margin; <hi>Enflaming your ſelves among the Oaks,</hi> intending thereby the Groves, wherein they ſacrificed to their Idol Gods; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.29. whereto indeed that ſutes well that follows, <hi>under every green Tree.</hi> But it is better rendered, as it is in our Bibles; <hi>Enflaming your ſelves with Idols.</hi> However it is meant certainly of that burning-hot and furious Luſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they went a Whoring after their Idols; that is, the violence and mad rage, wherewith they did purſue their idolatrous Worſhip; though many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude alſo the outward acts of uncleanneſs, which they committed at their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous meetings (ſee <hi>Mumb.</hi> 25.1, 2.) and as ſome think, by way of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring their Idol Gods; <hi>under every green Tree;</hi> to wit, in their Groves, or, it may be indeed, under every great and ſhadowy Tree, which they judged a goodly choice place for the rearing of their Altars; ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.4. <hi>ſlaying

That by this expreſſion is meant, either that they built their Altars, or Temples for their Idol-Gods, of the Pebbles in the River, which were made <hi>ſmooth</hi> by the continual waſhing and wearing of the Stream, or of Stones which they had digged out of the clefts of the Rocks, by the River, that were afterward curiouſly cut and poliſhed, (which indeed if meant, was contrary to an expreſs command of God; ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.25. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they built them in the moſt pleaſant places of their Land: Namely; cloſe by the ſide of the Rivers that ran through their moſt fruitful Vallies, where there lay uſually ſtore of Stones ſcattered about. 2. That by ſaying her <hi>portion</hi> was in theſe things, is meant, That ſhe delighted in this Idol Service, that ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed it her chief riches, bliſs, and happineſs, and truſted in it; and that it was all in all to her: inſtead of eſteeming the Lord her portion, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. ſhe accounted her Idols her portion. And, 3. That this is ſpoken in a way of deriſion: Theſe are the things which you have choſen for your portion, a very goodly portion have you therein gotten for your ſelves; <hi>they, they are thy lot;</hi> that is, as before, thy portion, or inheritance; <hi>even to them haſt thou poured a Drink-offering, thou haſt offered a Meat-offering;</hi> that is, to thine Idols there, as if they were Gods. And now, becauſe they thought indeed with theſe ſuperſtitious devices of theirs to ſerve and pleaſe God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that added; <hi>Should I receive Comfort in theſe?</hi> That is, Can ye be ſo ſtupid, as to think that theſe things would pleaſe or delight me?

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Behind the doors alſo, and the poſts haſt thou ſet up thy remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, Their Houſehold tutular Gods, which they had over and above their publick Idol-Gods; whoſe Images they had <hi>behind their doors and poſts</hi> of their Houſes, as it were for the defence of their Families, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in their going out and coming in.

And in this charge the Lord ſeems to hint to them, their great contempt of him, in that in ſtead of ſetting up his Laws upon the doors and poſts of their houſes, as he had commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.9. and 11.20. they had ſet up the memorials of their Idols there; and how violently they were affected to their Idolatrous practices, there being no place publick nor private, that was not defiled herewith, in regard whereof they were like Harlots, that were ready to play the Whore in every corner: <hi>for thou haſt diſcovered thy ſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other than me;</hi> that is, forſaking me, thou haſt diſcovered thy nakedneſs, or proſtituted thy ſelf to other Gods; <hi>and art gone up,</hi> to wit, to thine high places, as to thy Bed, ſet up in open view; <hi>thou haſt enlarged thy Bed;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, thou wert not content to keep to me alone, but wouldeſt needs worſhip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idol-Gods, together with me; yea, and that in my Temple, the place erected for my peculiar Worſhip, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.14, 15. and 21.4. But rather it is meant of their increaſing their Idolatrie more and more, by multiplying Altars, and places of Worſhip for their Idol-Gods; <hi>and made a Covenant with them;</hi> that is, forſaking me, thou haſt joined thy ſelf, as in a Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with thine Idol-Gods, undertaking that thou wouldſt always own them for thy Gods, and never forſake them.

&amp;c.] Some conceive that the Lord doth here ſtill inveigh againſt the Idolatry of his People, that Spiritual Adultery whereof he had hitherto ſpoken. And accordingly they hold, that by <hi>the King</hi> here is meant, that great Idol <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi> becauſe the word hath the notion of a King in it, and ſo they make the meaning of this paſſage to be this, that as Harlots are wont to paint, anoint, and perfume themſelves, that their Lovers may take the more delight in them; ſo they went to this Idol with great and coſtly Offerings. And ſo likewiſe they underſtand that which follows, of their ſending <hi>Meſſengers far off;</hi> to wit, to procure forreign Idols, and their debaſing themſelves, <hi>even unto Hell;</hi> to wit, in that of a pure Virgin <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was become a Harlot, or by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the true God to worſhip ſuch baſe Idols. But the moſt and beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors do indeed hold, that here the <hi>Jews</hi> are charged with another Sin, which was alſo a kind of Idolatry and Spiritual whoring, and the occaſion alſo of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their Idolatries: Namely; their ſeeking for aid to forreign Kings, when they were in any danger. <hi>And thou wenteſt to the King with Ointment,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſay ſome, to <hi>Tiglath-pileſer,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to whom <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſent for aid, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.7. who might be called <hi>the King</hi> in thoſe days by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency. But it is rather meant collectively of forreign Kings in general; to wit, that in their fears they were ſtill ready to fly to forreign Kings, the <hi>Aſſyrian, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,</hi> and <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and that with great and rich Preſents, Oil and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, and all ſorts of Spices, that they might win them to make Leagues with them, and afford them auxiliary Forces; <hi>and didſt ſend thy Meſſengers far off;</hi> that is, to very remote Countries, <hi>and didſt debaſe thy ſelf even to hell;</hi> that is, even as low as poſſibly thou couldeſt; which may be meant, either of their baſe and ſervile crouching before Heatheniſh Kings, proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their Feet, upon the Ground, owning themſelves unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Enemies, and ſuing and begging for their help; ſuch as was that Language of <hi>Ahaz</hi> to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.7. <hi>I am thy Servant and thy Son; come up and ſave me,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe (which is much to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) of the reproach and diſhonour they brought upon themſelves, by this their baſe ſubmiſſion to Heathens, no way ſuitable to the Majeſty of Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, and by truſting more to their Power and Friendſhip, than to the Favour and Almighty Power of their God, and his provident care over them for their preſervation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this alſo of their wearying themſelves in their Spiritual Whoredoms, their manifold Idolatrous courſes; in ſeeking out, making, adorning, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Idol-Gods; and accordingly alſo that which follows; <hi>yet ſaidſt thou not, There is no hope;</hi> that is, thou wert not ſo wiſe as to ſee that all this would do thee no good, thine Idols could not help thee; <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thine hand;</hi> that is, thy Gods, which thou eſteemeſt as thy life; (and it may be they are called the life of their hand, in a way of deriſion, becauſe they were Gods which their own hands had made) Or, even in theſe Idolatrous courſes thou haſt gotten great wealth (called the Life of their hand, becauſe they prized it as their Life, and had gotten it with the labour of their hands) and ſo art hardned againſt all inſtructions; <hi>therefore thou waſt not grieved;</hi>

that is, not troubled, but went on chuckering thy ſelf in thy wicked Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ways. But as the former Verſe, ſo this ſeems clearly to be meant, of their ſeeking to forreign Princes for help againſt thoſe that were like to invade them, <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way;</hi> that is, in thy long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies into remote Countries: But it ſeems to be ſpoken in a way of deriſion; as if he had ſaid, Thou haſt even tired thy ſelf in vain and to no purpoſe: <hi>Yet ſaidſt thou not, there is no hope;</hi> that is, though it were ſo, yet wouldeſt thou not be beaten off from theſe vain courſes, as concluding that there was no hope of getting any good thereby: <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thine hand;</hi> that is, thou imagineſt, that by this going ſo far to ſeek for the aid of Heatheniſh Kings, thou haſt attained, or art like to attain, that which thou ſoughteſt after; to wit, the upholding and ſafety of thy State, and the preſervation of your lives, when you thought all was before in danger to be deſtroyed, (for theſe fair promiſes which they had gotten of friendſhip and help from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes, is called, <hi>The life of thy Hand;</hi> either, 1. Becauſe it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their labour and endeavours; or, 2. Becauſe they thought thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Kings would be ready at Hand to help them; or, 3. Becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Hands would be ſtrengthned againſt their Enemies:) <hi>therefore thou waſt not grieved;</hi> that is, thou wert not troubled at thy tedious long Journies; thy pains ſeemed no pains to thee. But now conſidering their ſeeking help from Forreign Nations proved uſually, at leaſt in the concluſion, miſchievous to them, all this ſeems to be ſpoken ironically, and in away of deriſion; and it is all one in effect, as if they had been told, that they had taken a great deal of pains to deſtroy themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And of whom haſt thou been afraid or feared,</hi> &amp;c.] the Original word rendred <hi>afraid,</hi> imports a terrifying fear, and the latter rendred <hi>feared,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports any leſſer fear, and ſo it muſt be underſtood, as if it had been expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus, Of whom hadſt thou any dread or fear at all? Some hold that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is here charged with the impudency of a Harlot that is ſo bold in her waies of uncleanneſs, that ſhe fears neither God nor Man. Others think that the drift of theſe words, is to charge her with her being void of all true fear of God, as the ground of their ſecure and obſtinate running on in their ſinful waies; notwithſtanding the formal profeſſion ſhe made of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet the Lord tells her, that ſhe did not indeed fear him, becauſe ſhe was fallen away to a falſe and Idolatrous Worſhip, which was not according to the Rule of his Word: But rather the ſcope of theſe words, is to prevent an excuſe ſhe was like to make for her ſeeking to Forreign Princes for aid, namely, that ſhe did it when ſhe had juſt cauſe to fear, that ſhe ſhould have been overcome and ruined by mighty Enemies, before whom by her own ſtrength ſhe ſhould be never able to ſtand; for, in anſwer to this, God here demands of her, what cauſe ſhe had, having him to depend upon for help, to fear any Enemies though never ſo potent, ſo as to fall off from him, <hi>And of whom haſt thou been afraid or feared, that thou haſt lied:</hi> That is, that thou haſt dealt diſloyally and faſly with me, breaking thy marriage Covenant with me, <hi>and haſt not remembred me;</hi> that is, never minded me; neither thinking how able I was to ſecure thee from the rage of thine Enemies, nor what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

thou hadſt had hereof in former times, nor how perillous the wrath of my Jealouſie might be, if thou ſhouldſt not carry thy ſelf towards me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy duty, <hi>nor laid it to thy Heart;</hi> to wit, as conſidering what the iſſue of theſe things might be: As for the following clauſe, <hi>have not I held my peace even of old, and thou feareſt me not?</hi> The aim of that is to ſhew, that the true cauſe why they were ſo bold to do thoſe things, which were directly contrary to his commands, was becauſe he had been ſilent and born with them long, and this had ſo imboldned them, that they ſtood in no awe of him, or of his word; inſtead of being bettered by his long-ſuffering and patience, they were the worſe for it, and feared him the leſs; and, therefore it was high time to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his diſpleaſure againſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>I will declare thy righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid (with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to what was ſaid in the cloſe of the foregoing Verſe) I will no longer hold my peace, but by my Judgments executed upon thee, I will make known what thou art, <hi>I will declare thy Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, thy horrid wickedneſs, for it is Ironically ſpoken, and is much like that which God ſaid of <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.22. for which ſee the Note there. Yet it might be alſo ſpoken in a way of deriding the high eſteem which they had of themſelves as righteous, even in reſpect of their Idolatrous waies, for which God abhorred them; <hi>and thy works;</hi> to wit, wherein thou glorieſt ſo much; thy perfidiouſneſs and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Whoredoms, <hi>for they ſhall not profit thee,</hi> that is, whatever thou mayeſt think of thy unwarrantable ways, they ſhall do thee no good, but rather ſhall prove thy ruine at the laſt.</p>

But rather it is meant of thoſe auxiliary Forces which the Forreign Princes, to whom they had ſent, had promiſed to afford them; <hi>but the Wind ſhall carry them all away;</hi> that is, thy hope in them ſhall deceive thee; when thou lookeſt for help from them, they ſhall not be found, but ſhall be as Chaff which the Wind hath carried away, ſee the Note, Chap. 40.25. <hi>Vanity ſhall take them:</hi> that is, the leaſt thing that is, the leaſt breath of Wind ſhall take them away: <hi>but he that putteth his truſt in me, ſhall poſſeſs the Land, and ſhall inherit my Holy Mountain;</hi> which is meant of thoſe that ſhould be brought back out of <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country, and injoy Gods Ordinances again in his Temple, as appears by the following Verſe.</p>

they had brought themſelves, and therefore out of his meer pity and compaſſion, did reſolve to heal them of this their ſad condition, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.22. and 30.26.

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the Lips,</hi> &amp;c.] That which God doth effect in an extraordinary way, when there was no likelyhood of it, is frequently in the Scripture called creating; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. Some carry on theſe words to thoſe which follow, and ſo make the <hi>peace</hi> there mentioned to be <hi>the fruit of the Lips</hi> here intended, and that in ſeveral regards, as, 1. That God would make all the talk of the People to be of Peace, whereas formerly their talk was wholly for War, and the miſeries thereof: Or, 2. That God would give them Peace as the fruit of their Prayers: Or, 3. That God would by giving them Peace, perform the promiſes which with his Lips, or the Lips of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, he had made to them: Or, 4.

Some extend it to Gods cauſing the glad Tidings of the Goſpel of Peace to be Preached unto them, thereby working in them much inward Peace. But becauſe our Tranſlation, as doth the <hi>Hebrew</hi> alſo, divides theſe Words by a ſtop from the former: <hi>I Create the fruit of the Lips;</hi> therefore the moſt of Expoſitors do by <hi>the fruit of the Lips</hi> underſtand the voice of Praiſe and Thankſgivings, elſewhere called <hi>the calves of our Lips,</hi> Hoſ. 14.2. And indeed the Apoſtle ſeems direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to intend the Expounding of this place of our Prophet thus, where he ſaith <hi>Heb</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God continually; that is, the fruit of our Lips, giving thanks to his Name;</hi> only indeed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words are added to ſhew how God would create his praiſe, this <hi>fruit of the Lips;</hi> namely, by giving them occaſion of filling thir Mouths with Gods prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the proſperous and happy condition whereunto he would bring them, and wherein he would ſettle them: <hi>Peace, Peace;</hi> that is, abundance of Peace, and long continued Peace there ſhall be, <hi>to him that is far off, and to him that is

near, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is, as well to thoſe that are carried away far off into Captivity, as to them that ſhall be left in the Land of <hi>Judea:</hi> Or, as well to thoſe that are far off in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as to thoſe that are in other ſtrange Countries, but not ſo far from <hi>Judea,</hi> as <hi>Babylon</hi> was. But now becauſe the peace here promiſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> did typically fore-ſhadow the peace purchaſed by Chriſt, and publiſhed by the Goſpel, even this may be here included; and ſo by <hi>him that is far off, and him that is nigh,</hi> muſt be meant, not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs in that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Chriſt came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them which were nigh,</hi> he doth at leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude clearly to this place.

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>But the wicked,</hi> &amp;c.] Leſt the Wicked amongſt Gods People ſhould flatter themſelves with hope of the Peace promiſed in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe, the Prophet here adds, that there ſhould be no peace for them; <hi>but the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt;</hi> that is, as the Sea, being reſtleſs in it ſelf, by reaſon of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ebbing and flowing, is yet more reſtleſs, when it is toſſed to and fro with ſtormy Winds, and doth continually caſt up mud, and foam, and filth: ſo wicked men, that never enjoy any inward Peace, partly by reaſon of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hurry of their inordinate Paſſions and Luſts, and partly by reaſon of the terrors of their Conſciences, are yet more reſtleſs, when God brings outward miſeries and troubles upon them; and ſo their Hearts, from whence nothing iſſues forth at any time, but what is ſinful and wicked, are then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of blaſphemies, and impatient ſwellings and murmurings againſt God. I know there are ſome that underſtand this of the neighbour Nations, that did rage like the troubled Sea, when they ſaw the <hi>Jews</hi> returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and endeavouring to rebuild their City and Temple, ſtriving by all poſſible means to hinder them, but did nothing thereby, but only diſcover their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſs: but the former Expoſition is the beſt.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>CRY aloud,</hi> &amp;c.] This the Prophet is enjoined to do, that he might waken this ſleepy, ſtupid, ſecure People, and make them know that they were of thoſe wicked ones, to whom in the cloſe of the foregoing Chapter he had ſaid, <hi>there ſhould be no peace. Cry aloud,</hi> which is in the <hi>Hebrew, Cry with the Throa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> (as we uſe to ſay, Set up thy throat) that is, with all poſſible vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:42788:267"/>
earneſtneſs, and zeal, as having to do with a People wilfully deaf and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to hear; <hi>ſpare not;</hi> to wit, for fear of any Mans diſpleaſure; <hi>lift up thy voice like a Trumpet;</hi> to wit, as Gods Herald, ſent to denounce War againſt them; <hi>ſhew my People their tranſgreſſion, and the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their ſins;</hi> that is, convince this ſtupid People of their ſins, who do vainly Glory in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of being my People, whereas indeed this is an aggravation of their wickedneſs: I do indeed own them as my Covenant-People, and if they will repent, I will eſteem them as my People; but if they continue a wicked People, I ſhall abhor them the more for calling themſelves my People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the main cauſe is alledged, why the Prophet was to <hi>cry aloud</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> Namely, becauſe they were an Hypocritical People, and had high thoughts of their own Righteouſneſs, and ſo had need to be awakened, that they might be convinced of their wickedneſs. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways,</hi> &amp;c. Some underſtand this of their murmuring againſt Gods dealing with them; to wit, that they were ſtill deſiring to know the reaſons of Gods Counſels, and the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Providence towards them, as conceiting themſelves ſo Righteous, that God had no cauſe ſo much as to frown upon them; <hi>they ask of me the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of juſtice;</hi> that is, they deſire that I would deal juſtly with them; <hi>they take delight in approaching to God;</hi> to wit, that they may argue the matter, and contend with him, about his dealing with them. But rather theſe words tend all to ſet forth their Hypocriſie; to wit, that though they were ſo inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably wicked, yet they made a great ſhew of Religion; <hi>yet they ſeek me daily;</hi> to wit, by reſorting to my Sanctuary, that they may ſeek my favour by their Prayers, and Sacrifices, and Offerings; or by going to their Synagogues, and to my Houſe, the Temple, to hear my Word, and to inquire of my Prieſts and Prophets, what it is that I required of them; <hi>and delight to know my ways;</hi> that is, they pretend to do ſo, <hi>as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. that is, as if they were certainly reſolved to do what God required, if they did but know what his will were; <hi>they ask of me the Ordinances of juſtice;</hi> that is, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of my Servants what that Righteouſneſs was, which by my Laws I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them; <hi>they take delight;</hi> that is, they ſeem to take delight, <hi>in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God;</hi> that is, in ſeeking to enjoy communion with me in mine Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added to ſhew that their Hypocriſie was ſuch, that as wicked as they were, they were ready to quarrel with God, if he ſhewed any diſregard of them; <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our Soul;</hi> that is, our ſelves, (ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.25.) to wit, by faſting; ſee the Note, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. <hi>and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> that is, thou regardeſt it not: It is true, they boaſted as much in all their other outward acts of devotion, which they performed, enjoined them by the Law; but this of their faſting is particularly inſtanced in, becauſe they placed ſo much confidence in this, when in their diſtreſſes they ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in this way, for his help and favour: And the ground of this their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation may be, that notwithſtanding their faſting and humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, whether on the Faſt in the ſeventh Month, expreſly enjoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:42788:268"/>
by Gods Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.27. (which may the rather ſeem particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, becauſe at that time they were alſo enjoined to releaſe their debts, and ſet free their Servants; for the not doing whereof God doth afterwards here reprove them) or upon any other voluntary and occaſional Faſts, ſuch as was that of <hi>Eſther, Eſth.</hi> 4.16. Yet God by his Prophets did as bitterly cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as a wicked people, as if they had never done any ſuch thing (and ſo this might be ſpoken with reſpect to that charge of God to the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) Or, yet God was regardleſs of them, when in their troubles and dangers they did in this ſolemn manner, by faſting and prayer, ſeek for help and ſuccour from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the anſwer which God returns to their expoſtulation: <hi>Behold, in the day of your Faſt</hi> (which ſeems to imply, that God did not own it for a Faſt) <hi>you find pleaſure;</hi> that is, you ſatisfy your Luſts, by doing thoſe things, which may ſatisfie your ſinful deſires and delights: Or, you do what you pleaſe your ſelves: Yea, and ſome would have it reſtrained to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of their pleaſing themſelves in the exacting of their debts, of which he ſpeaks in the next words; <hi>and exact all your labours;</hi> that is, your money which you had gotten by your labour (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 55.2. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.10.) of thoſe to whom you had lent it, even the pooreſt of them, not bating a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which they owe you. Indeed this is rendered by ſome, as it is in the Margin, <hi>and exact all things, wherewith you grieve others;</hi> and then it may be meant of the hard labour and ſervice which they exacted of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in extremity, above what God allowed them, or beyond the time they were to ſerve them; or of the Rigour and Cruelty wherewith they exacted their debts, which was very grievous to thoſe from whom they were exacted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Behold, you faſt for ſtrife and debate,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this, as if the Prophet charged them either, 1. That <hi>ſtrife and debate</hi> was that which they propounded to themſelves, as the end of their faſting: in that they deſigned thereby to cover their Oppreſſions with a ſhew of Piety, as it was in <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s Faſt, when ſhe had plotted the Death of <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.19. Or, 2. That there was much <hi>ſtrife and debate</hi> amongſt them upon their ſolemn Faſt-days. For (ſay they) they uſed, when they met on thoſe days, to be often quarrelling and brawling one with another; at leaſt they were wont to take advantage of the Reſt enjoined on thoſe days, to look over their debt-Books and Bonds, and Mortgages, and to prepare for, and promote what they could, the proſecuting of their Law-ſuits againſt their debtors. Yea, and there is a Learned Expoſitor that holds, that it being their Cuſtom on thoſe days to ſit in Judgment againſt Offenders, that hereby God might be pacified towards them, the greateſt matter they uſually there did, was to complain of their Debtors, and to procure ſome Judiciary Sentence againſt them. And ſo for the following words; <hi>and to ſmite with the Fiſt of wickedneſs;</hi> ſome conceive it is meant of their quarrelling and fighting on thoſe days; at leaſt of Maſters beating and abuſing their Servants, or of the imperious and contemptuous carriage of their great ones towards the mean ſort, in beating and ſtriking them, or of Mens paſſionate falling upon their Debtors, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent hands upon them, as if they would force them to pay that which they were not able to pay, according to that which is ſaid in the Parable of the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:42788:268"/>
Servant, whoſe Lord had forgiven him a great debt, and he afterwards meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one of his fellow-Servants, which ought him an hundred pence; <hi>laid hands on him, and took him by the Throat, ſaying, Pay me that thou oweſt, Matth.</hi> 18.28. But to me it ſeems no way probable, that they either did or are charged with doing theſe things on their faſt-days. Queſtionleſs all that is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is, that even after their Faſting and Praying, they went on in their ways of cruelty and unmercifulneſs to their poor Brethren; their Faſts were followed with <hi>ſtrife and debate,</hi> as if that had been the very end of their faſting. And herein conſiſts the abſurdity of their dealing with God, that whilſt they ſought in this manner to beg mercy of God, they ſhould be at the ſame time ſo cruel to their Brethren. <hi>Ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, ye are not to faſt as now adays ye do, with ſuch brawling and loud out-cries, as make the Air aloft to ring of them, or as are like to mount up to Heaven, and draw down vengeance upon you: Or, as others would have it, you muſt not faſt, as now ye do, weeping and howling aloud by way of oſtentation, or as hoping that hereby alone you keep a faſt as God requires. But far more probably, I conceive, others hold, that God doth here inform them, that if they deſired to have the voice of their Prayers <hi>heard on high;</hi> that is, by God in Heaven, they muſt faſt in another manner than they did in thoſe times. There muſt not be ſuch ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſuch contention and oppreſſion amongſt them as there was, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by their faſtings to prevail with God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen? a day for a Man to afflict his Soul,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.29. <hi>is it to bow down his head as a bullruſh,</hi> which being broken and bruiſed, will hang down with its own weight, <hi>and to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him;</hi> to wit, as they uſed to do in times of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Humiliation and faſting; as it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. <hi>that he faſted and lay in ſackcloth;</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Job</hi> 2.8. The meaning is, that the humbling of themſelves thus out-wardly, if they did not withall repent of and forſake their ſins, was not the Faſt which God enjoined, approved, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in; <hi>wilt thou call this a Faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</hi> As if he had ſaid, you cannot in reaſon think ſo, but rather that the Lord will abhor it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.] By theſe <hi>bands of wickedneſs</hi> ſome underſtand the combination of Judges, or others for the oppreſſion of the poorer ſort. But rather hereby is meant, whatever it was wherewith the poor were ſtraitned and pinched by the rich, as their obligations and conveyances, either unjuſtly obtained, or cruelly proſecuted, even againſt thoſe that were notable to pay; yea, and the bringing ſuch into Bondage, or caſting them into Priſon, may be herein alſo included; of all which God requires here, they ſhould be releaſed. And to the ſame effect is the Reſt here added; <hi>to undo the heavy burdens, to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke.</hi> For though in requiring that the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> (or <hi>afflicted</hi>) ſhould <hi>go free;</hi> he ſeems to have ſpecial reſpect to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their debtors from reſtraint, either in Priſon or elſewhere, they not daring to ſtir abroad for fear of Arreſts; and to the ſetting of their Servants at liberty, at the times enjoined by Gods Law for their manumiſſion; yet it
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:42788:269"/>
may be meant more generally of freeing them from all the vexations and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, under which they were cruſhed. And by <hi>the yoke</hi> may be meant all the heavy preſſures they groaned under. The meaning is, that they muſt leave off their extortions and oppreſſions, and ſo likewiſe all other their ſins, if they would faſt as God required they ſhould do.</p>

And indeed this laſt I conceive is here principally intended; for as his aim before was to ſhew them, that their outward faſting was not enough, unleſs they did alſo Mourn for and abandon their ſinful courſes, ſo here likewiſe it ſeems his drift is to ſhew them, that it was not enough for them to forbear their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Worldly Imployments on the Sabbath day, if they did in the mean time prophane them with their wicked and ſinful waies; if they ſhould be never ſo ſtrict, not to go a Journey, nor dreſs Meat on the Sabbath day, and yet, at the ſame time oppreſs the Poor, this the Lord would not eſteem, to be a Sanctifying of the Sabbath day. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>If thou turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day;</hi> that is, that which pleaſeth thine own corrupt will; <hi>and call the Sabbath a delight;</hi> that is, your great delight, as delighting in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion you then enjoy with God in his Ordinances; <hi>the Holy of the Lord, and Honourable;</hi> to wit, as being Conſecrated wholly to the ſervice of God; <hi>and ſhalt honour him;</hi> to wit, by denying to pleaſe themſelves, that they might obey Gods Command, and enjoy Communion with him; <hi>not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words;</hi> to wit, ſuch as are pleaſing to corrupt Nature. But ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, in his love and favour, it is clearly ſpoken with reference to the foregoing Verſe; as if he had ſaid, If thou delight in the Sanctifying Gods Sabbath, and to that end doſt with-hold thy ſelf from thy Carnal delights, thou ſhalt have far better delights than thoſe, <hi>thou ſhalt delight thy ſelf in the Lord;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 22.26. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>And I will cauſe thee to ride upon the High places of the Earth;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, to dwell in places of ſecurity and ſafety, ſee the Note, <hi>Chap</hi> 33.16. Or, the meaning may be only, that God would bring them again into the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> which was a Mountainous Country, far higher than the Neighbouring Countries were. But ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13. <hi>And feed thee with the Heritage of Jacob thy Father;</hi> that is, with the good things of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God had promiſed to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>BEhold,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſeems ſtill to be in anſwer to that in the foregoing <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that he cannot ſave;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.2. <hi>neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear;</hi> that is, he is not thick of hearing, through old Age, or otherwiſe: for this expreſſion of <hi>heavy ears;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For your hands are defiled with Blood, and your fingers with Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.15. <hi>your lips have ſpoken lies, your tongue hath uttered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs;</hi> whereby may be meant whatever was ſpoken by them wickedly, to the hurt of their Neighbours, as by ſlandering, cozening, falſe accuſing them, bearing falſe Witneſs, or ſwearing falſely againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, And what likelihood is there that the Holy God ſhould regard the ſtretching forth of ſuch hands, or the words that are uttered by ſuch Lips.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>None calleth for Juſtice, nor any pleadeth for Truth,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.10. The meaning is, that there were ſcarce any Judges, or others that would zealouſly and freely ſpeak for the Truth, and for the juſt cauſe: As namely, by reproving thoſe that dealt unjuſtly, and adviſing them to deal more juſtly, or by undertaking to plead for thoſe that were injured, or oppreſſed; all Men were willing to wink at the injuries and oppreſſions of their Brethren, and never offered to do any thing for their defence and relief; <hi>they truſt in Vanity;</hi> that is, they truſt in thoſe things that can do them no good, but will utterly deceive them; ſome underſtand it of their fraudulent dealing with their Brethren, others of the vain hopes wherewith they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged themſelves in their wicked ways, and others otherwiſe; but ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.15. and 48.9. and <hi>Job</hi> 15.31. <hi>and ſpeak lies;</hi> to wit, ſay ſome, in a way of boaſting. But by <hi>lies,</hi> the ſame is meant that was before called <hi>Vanity; they conceive miſchief, and bring forth Iniquity;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14. and <hi>Job</hi> 15.35.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>They hatch Cockatrice</hi> (or Adders) <hi>Eggs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, the plots they contrive againſt others, prove many times miſchievous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But rather the meaning is, that thoſe poyſonous and pernicious plots, which they have deſigned againſt others, are at laſt brought to effect. For ſtill the Prophet proceeds to ſet forth the horrid wickedneſs that was amongſt them, which had made a ſeparation betwixt God and them: And ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that which follows; <hi>and weave the Spiders web;</hi> though ſome underſtand them either, 1. Of the vanity of their Will-Worſhips, or Hypocritical Works, their Faſting and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that though they have a ſhew of much Zeal and Holineſs; yet they ſhall not ſecure them from Gods Wrath, nor be any way any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:42788:271"/>
to them. Or, 2. Of the vanity of their miſchievous plots againſt others, that whatever great advantage they might promiſe to themſelves by their Plots and Projects for the oppreſſion of others, yet they ſhould prove ineffectual and unuſeful in this regard, like ſo many Cobwebs that are preſently ſwept away; for which, ſee the Note, <hi>Job</hi> 8.14. But rather this ſtill tends to ſet forth their wickedneſs, in that as the Spider is ſtill making her Webs to catch and deſtroy the poor Flies, ſo they were continually with much labour contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with many artificial plots for the intangling and ruining of others; <hi>he that eateth of their Eggs dieth;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, he that joins with them in their wicked Counſels and Deſigns, ſhall be deſtroyed thereby; or rather he that hath any commerce with them, his very life will be endangered thereby: As for the laſt words, <hi>and that which is cruſhed breaketh forth into a Viper;</hi> they may be read, as in the Margin, <hi>that which is ſprinkled, is as if there brake out a Viper;</hi> and then it is as if he had ſaid, that not only the eating of their Cockatrice Eggs, but even a Mans being ſprinkled with the bloody drops of their Eggs, when they are broken, is likely to be mortal to him; but now reading it as it is in our Bibles; <hi>and that which is cruſhed breaketh forth into a Viper;</hi> the meaning is, either that if a Man did but go about to ſearch into their Plots, and Counſels, or at leaſt to diſcover them and cruſh them, they would be ready like Vipers upon ſuch a Man: Or rather, that if men were any way drawn in to have any dealing with ſuch Men, they would be their bane; as if a man ſhould open a Vipers Egg, thinking it to be the Egg of ſome Fowl that uſeth to be eaten, and a Viper ſhould fly in his Face; or as if a Man ſhould caſually tread upon ſuch an Egg, and the Serpent in it ſhould faſten upon him. So that however the words are tranſlated, the meaning ſeems to be plainly this, That with ſuch men there is no ſafe dealing any way.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Their Webs ſhall not become Garments, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their works,</hi> &amp;c.] How theſe words may be underſtood, according to the Expoſition which ſome give of the foregoing Verſe; ſee in the Note there. But doubtleſs the meaning is, that though their plots and practices were hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others; yet they ſhould bring no profit to them; either they ſhall no way advance themſelves thereby in their outward condition; or, if they do that, yet that ſhall ſtand them in no ſtead, as to the ſheltering of them from the wrath of God, and from the Evils that are coming upon them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſhew that no better could be juſtly expected from ſuch wicked plots and practices as theirs were, is that added which follows; <hi>their works are works of Iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands;</hi> that is, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imployed in works of oppreſſion and violence, and other ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Their feet run to Evil, and they make haſte to ſhed innocent Blood,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.16. from whence this ſeems to have been taken. And ſo likewiſe the Apoſtle cites theſe words, either from that place of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or this of our Prophet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. and that to prove that the <hi>Jews</hi> lay under the ſame guilt with the <hi>Gentiles; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;</hi> they not only do Evil, but they do it alſo adviſedly and deliberately: their minds being continually plotting and contriving miſchief; <hi>waſting and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:42788:271"/>
are in their paths;</hi> that is, wherever they go they waſte and deſtroy; or all they do tends hereto.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The way of peace they know not,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, they are of ſuch a turbulent Spirit, and are ſo violently bent upon all injurious courſes, that they know not how to live peaceably with any body; they mind not peace, not having the leaſt inclination that way, but are meer ſtrangers to it, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with any peaceable courſes: <hi>and there is no judgment in their goings;</hi> that is, they have no reſpect to Juſtice and Right in any thing they do; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.1. <hi>they have made them crooked paths;</hi> that is, their ways are not according to the ſtreight rule of Gods Word; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5. <hi>whoever goeth therein ſhall not know peace;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, whoever converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them will be of the ſame unpeaceable diſpoſition with them; or rather, whoever imitateth them, and treadeth in theſe wicked and unpeaceable paths of theirs, ſhall never proſper; they ſhall never know what Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity means; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet having in the foregoing Verſes ſhewn the People how extreamly wicked they were, doth here declare, that for this it was that God had brought them into ſuch a ſad condition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that they had no cauſe to murmur againſt God, as was before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 58.3. And becauſe of that which follows; <hi>our tranſgreſſions are multiplied before thee,</hi> &amp;c. very many Expoſitors hold that the Prophet ſpeaks this in the name of the Captive <hi>Jews,</hi> acknowledging to God, that their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs was the cauſe why God ſtood aloof from them, and did not come in to their help; <hi>Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth juſtice overtake us;</hi> that is, it comes not near us. Becauſe of theſe our forementioned Sins, and particularly becauſe we have not minded Judgment and Juſtice in our dealings with others, therefore God hid himſelf from them, and did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a way of Juſtice for them, to protect them, and to execute Judgment upon their Enemies; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.27. <hi>we-wait for light, but behold obſcurity, for brightneſs, but we walk in darkneſs;</hi> that is, we were ſtill hoping, eſpecially when we had ſought God by faſting and Prayer, that he would have brought things into a more comfortable condition, but, alas, our miſeries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill upon us; yea, even when ſometime there ſeemed to be ſome hope, and we began to promiſe our ſelves more comfortable times; <hi>behold,</hi> even then ſo great was our diſappointment, our condition became rather worſe and worſe; ſee the Notes, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>We grope for the Wall like the Blind, and we grope as if we had no Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. to which very place the Prophet ſeems to have reſpect in theſe expreſſions; <hi>we ſtumble at noon-day, as in the night;</hi> that is, we are apt to miſcarry and fall into miſchiefs, where the danger might have been eaſily foreſeen and prevented. Both theſe expreſſions are added with reſpect to that wherewith the foregoing Verſe was cloſed, <hi>we walk in darkneſs.</hi> But ſee the Notes alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 5.14. and 12.24. <hi>we are in deſolate places, as dead men;</hi> that is, we are in an exceeding ſad and deſolate condition, over-whelmed with miſeries, and hopeleſs of ever ſeeing better days, like Men that live in deſolate places, where there is nothing that can afford
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:42788:272"/>
Men any comfort, or rather, our condition is liker to that of dead Men in their Graves, then to that of living Men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>We roar all like Bears, and mourn ſore like Doves,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.14. Theſe different Similitudes may ſeem to be uſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; the one, their loud out-cries, like that of the roaring of Bears; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their continual bemoaning themſelves, like that of the mourning of Doves; or elſe that they all lamented the Miſery of their Condition; ſome with lowder out-cries, others with more inward and private Mournings: <hi>We look for Judgment, but there is none; for Salvation, but it is far off from us;</hi> ſee the Note above, Ver. 9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>For our Tranſgreſſions are multiplyed before thee,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, However we may flatter our ſelves, and endeavour to excuſe and cover over our Sins, yet thou knoweſt them all; and hereby thou haſt been provoked againſt us, and this hath been the cauſe why thou haſt ſtood aloof from helping us: <hi>And our ſins teſtify againſt us;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.9. <hi>For our Tranſgreſſions are with us;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, they are evident in the Evils they have brought upon us. But rather the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that their Sins were ſo manifeſt and notoriouſly great, that they could not but be in their own Conſciences fully convinced of them. And to the ſame purpoſe is the following Clauſe; <hi>And as for our Iniquities we know them;</hi> it being clearly either a confeſſion of their owning the Sins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had offended God; or an humble bewailing themſelves for them; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. And now in all this the Prophet joyns himſelf with the reſt of the People, not as guilty of the ſame Sins with them, but as confeſſing and bewailing their Sins together with his own.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>In Tranſgreſſing,</hi> &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing Verſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the wickedneſs of the People in general, as the cauſe of all the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that were come upon them, here the Prophet proceeds to ſet them forth more diſtinctly and particularly: And ſo having cloſed that Verſe with thoſe words, <hi>And as for our Iniquities we know them;</hi> here he ſheweth what thoſe their great Iniquities were, <hi>In Tranſgreſſing, and lying againſt the Lord, and departing away from our God;</hi> and by all theſe ſeveral Terms is meant, their perfidious Apoſtacy from God by their bold Tranſgreſſing of his Laws, without any regard to their promiſes, and the Covenant they had made with God; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And ſo by ſpeaking oppreſſion and revolt,</hi> is meant, that their talk for the moſt part was of thoſe things that tended to the Oppreſſion of their Brethren, and that did proclaim their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and Apoſtacy from God; <hi>and by conceiving and uttering from the Heart words of falſhood;</hi> that is, they contrive in their Hearts, and then afterward adviſedly ſpeak falſe and deceitful words; See the Note above, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And Judgment is turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth a far off,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this as thoſe paſſages before, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9.11. But rather this is a further Declaration of the Wickedneſs of the People; to wit, that all Juſtice was vaniſhed as it were from amongſt them; neither in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judicature, nor elſewhere, was there any regard of right or wrong; <hi>for Truth is fallen in the Street;</hi> that is, being over-born by falſhood, or
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:42788:272"/>
having no body to ſupport her, Truth falleth to the ground in all places of Publick concourſe; ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 29.7. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55.11. <hi>and equity cannot enter;</hi> that is, it is ſhut out by Violence and not ſuffered to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Yea, Truth faileth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Neither in publick nor private was there any Truth to be found; ſee the foregoing Note. And <hi>he that departeth from Evil, maketh himſelf a Prey;</hi> or as it is in the Margin, <hi>is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted mad;</hi> that is, a Man void of all Reaſon. <hi>And the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him, that there was no Judgment;</hi> that is, That there was no Juſtice to be found amongſt them: And thence it hath been, that he hath ſtood aloof from helping us in our Miſeries.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And he ſaw that there was no Man,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for Right and Juſtice; ſee the Note above, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>And wondered that there was no Interceſſor;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, none that would mediate with God, or Pray to him for this Wicked People; or rather, none that would ſtep in and interpoſe himſelf to Plead for Juſtice, and defend the Oppreſſed; for ſo we find it expreſſed afterward in a place very like to this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 63.5. <hi>And I looked and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold.</hi> As for this expreſſion of Gods wondring, it is uſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply both how ſtrange and wonderful it was, that Gods own peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ſo grievouſly and univerſally corrupted, that there ſhould not be a Man found amongſt them, that ſhould oppoſe the Injuſtice of thoſe Times; and likewiſe what Riches of Grace it diſcovered in God, that he ſhould be ſo ſolicitouſly careful for the ſaving of a People ſo deſperately Wicked: Which is added in the following Words; <hi>Therefore his Arm brought Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto him, and his Righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him;</hi> where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which we Tranſlate <hi>unto him,</hi> may be an Elegant redundancy, uſual in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: Or, if that will not be admitted, then it muſt be underſtood, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods People, to wit, that when there was no man that did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the ſaving of his People, or to defend them againſt thoſe that made a Prey of them, then of his own free Grace, God himſelf undertook the Work, and by his Infinite Power, (his Almighty Arm, ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.5. and 53.1.) without the aſſiſtance or mediation of any Man, brought Salvation unto his People; <hi>and his Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, his Juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judging betwixt his People and their unjuſt Oppreſſors; <hi>it ſuſtained him,</hi> that is, it upheld and preſerved his People from being utterly ruined and deſtroyed: Or elſe of God himſelf, as he is Intereſted in his People, and as it was his work to ſave his wronged and oppreſſed People; to wit, <hi>That his Arm brought Salvation unto him, and his Righteouſneſs it ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him;</hi> namely, In that by his Almighty Power, and by his Righteous Judgments he had provided for the preſerving and upholding of his own Cauſe and People: And indeed this agreeth beſt with two other places, that ſeem parallel with this, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 63.5. <hi>And I looked and there was none to help—therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation unto me, and my Fury it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me;</hi> and that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1. <hi>His Right Hand and his Holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</hi> I know that many Learned Expoſitors do underſtand all this of that great
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:42788:273"/>
work of Mans Redemption by Chriſt; to wit, that God of his own free Grace, did by himſelf take care for the ſaving of his choſen People, when no body elſe minded it: But rather it is ſurely meant of Gods deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his People the <hi>Jews</hi> from being deſtroyed; though it may well be granted, that as often elſewhere, ſo here alſo, under the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, the Redemption of Gods People by Chriſt, of which that was a Type, is comprehended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>For he put on Righteouſneſs as a Breaſt-plate, and an Helmet of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon his Head,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning of this is, that God would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf as an Armed Man for the ſafe-guarding of his People, and for the deſtruction of their Enemies; and that hereby there ſhould be a clear diſcovery of his <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, his Faithfulneſs in making good his promiſes to his People, or rather his Juſtice in judging Righteouſly between them and their Enemies, (ſee the foregoing Note,) and his tender care for the <hi>Salvation</hi> and deliverance of his People; this being that which moved him ſo Gloriouſly to appear for the deliverance of his People, and the ruine of their Enemies. And to the ſame purpoſe is the next Clauſe, <hi>and he put on the Garments of Vengeance for Cloathing, and was clad with Zeal as a Cloke;</hi> namely, that his Zeal for his own Glory, and his Indignation for the Oppreſſion of his People ſhould be clearly ſeen in the Vengeance which upon this account he would Execute upon their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>According to their Deeds, accordingly he will repay, Fury to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, Recompence to his Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.] It is in the Original, <hi>According to Recompences,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo thereupon, ſome would have this to be the meaning of the Words, that according to what God had often formerly done in recompencing to the Enemies of his People, the Evil which they had done unto his People, ſo he would now do again: But taking the Words as they are Tranſlated in our Bibles, the meaning is clear, that God would in great Fury avenge himſelf upon his Peoples Enemies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they had deſerved, or according to the Evil which they had done to his People. And now by theſe <hi>Adverſaries and Enemies</hi> may be meant all the Enemies of Gods People the <hi>Jews,</hi> both Forreign, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> and others, and likewiſe Domeſtick, the Wicked Princes, Judges, and others that oppreſſed their Brethren, eſpecially the Righteous amongſt them; yea, by many Learned Expoſitors it is held, that together with the Enemies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> here more eſpecially intended, not only all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods Church in all Ages are comprehended; (which is the more probable, becauſe of the following Clauſe, <hi>to the Iſlands he will repay recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;</hi> that is, to the Enemies of his People in the remoteſt Parts, and where they think themſelves ſafeſt from all danger; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.1.) but alſo their Spiritual Enemies, as with reſpect to Chriſts Victory over them; which Expoſition indeed the following Verſes ſeem much to favour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>So ſhall they fear the Name of the Lord from the</hi> Weſt, <hi>and his Glory from the riſing of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, By occaſion of this Glorious Work of God, mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, in delivering his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:42788:273"/>
by executing vengeance upon their Enemies; Men ſhall fear the Lord, and the Name and Glory of God ſhall be renowned throughout the World; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.3. And indeed (as was hinted in the foregoing Note) though this may be meant primarily of that terror wherewith all the Nations in the World in a manner ſhould be ſtruck, upon the Deſtruction which God would bring on the Enemies of the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet the words do ſo clearly ſeem to intend alſo that filial fear wherewith, upon the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Church of Chriſt throughout the whole World ſhould fear God; that whereas now God was deſpiſed by his own People, he ſhould then be honoured by the Nations all the World over; (whence it is alſo that in the following words there is a Promiſe added of Gods aiding them againſt their Enemies) that this doth much confirm that more general Expoſition given in the foregoing Note, of the revenge which God would bring upon the Enemies of his People; <hi>When the Enemy ſhall come in like a Flood;</hi> that is, when-ever the Devil and his Inſtruments ſhall break in upon my Church like a Flood, (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.7, 8.) <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him,</hi> or (as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>put him to flight;</hi> that is, God by his Divine and Almighty Power ſhall take part with his People, and raiſe up Forces againſt theſe their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, wherewith he will oppoſe and vanquiſh them: See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.26. and 11.12. and 49.22. Or, God with a blaſt of his Breath only ſhall cauſe them to flee; yea, the meaning may be, if we underſtand it of the Spiritual Enemies of Gods People, that he would by his Holy Spirit ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtrengthen his People, that they ſhould be able to withſtand and overcome theſe their mighty Adverſaries, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come to</hi> Zion, &amp;c.] That is, God will ſend one that ſhall redeem his People out of their Bondage and Miſery: Now, as hereby the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was intended, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was queſtionleſs this Redeemer: But, as this was alſo intended as a Promiſe of the Spiritual Redemption, whereof the other was a Type, Chriſt was the Redeemer. And that this was intended, is clear by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles citing this place, (according to the Tranſlation of the Septuagint) to prove that certainly the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould at laſt be converted, and made partakers of the Redemption that is by Chriſt; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. <hi>And ſo</hi> (that is, when the fullneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in,) <hi>all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved;</hi> (that is, the generality of the Nation of the <hi>Jews) As it is Written, There ſhall come out of</hi> Sion <hi>the Deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Jacob; <hi>For this is my Covenant unto them,</hi> &amp;c. It is, as if the Apoſtle had argued thus, The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold that Chriſt ſhould come as a Redeemer to the Church and Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who as yet do deſpiſe and reject him; and therefore certainly there ſhall a time come, when the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall embrace Chriſt as their Redeemer: As for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, <hi>and unto them that turn from Tranſgreſſion in</hi> Jacob, as they are ſpoken with reſpect to the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they imply both, that that deliverance ſhould be wrought chiefly for the ſake of that little Remnant amongſt them that were reformed by their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:42788:274"/>
and that it ſhould be to them only a real Mercy: But as they are ſpoken with reſpect to Mans Redemption by Chriſt, they plainly ſhew, that none can juſtly challenge any Intereſt therein, but only thoſe that forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Sins do turn unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, with his People, whom <hi>the Redeemer</hi> mentioned in the foregoing Verſe ſhould redeem. <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, upon Chriſt the Redeemer. And ſo they take it as a promiſe made by God the Father to Chriſt, that his Word and Spirit ſhould be for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to his <hi>Seed,</hi> concerning whom, See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.10. But I rather conceive that this is ſpoken either to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and then the meaning muſt be either; 1. That this which God had now promiſed by him ſhould be ſo accompliſhed, that the memory of it ſhould be continued unto all Poſterity; Or, 2. That the Spirit which God had put upon him, and that Goſpel-promiſe which he had publiſhed, ſhould be continued to the Prophets and others that ſhould ſucceed him in the Work of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtry, even to the end of the World: Or rather to the Church, the Redeemed ones in his <hi>Zion,</hi> (to whom God here turns his Speech) <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is upon thee, and my Words which I have put in thy Mouth ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c. that is, My Word and Spirit ſhall ſtill be with thee, for thine inſtruction and direction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Worlds end; there ſhall be always of my Meſſengers, Prophets, Apoſtles, and other Miniſters and Teachers, that ſhall ſucceſſively Preach my Word faithfully to you, and my Spirit ſhall go along with their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to make it work effectually upon you; ſo that there ſhall be ſtill a profeſſion of my Truth among you. A clear proof, that though Councils may err, yet the true Catholick Church ſhall never err.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE.</hi> 1. <hi>ARISE,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken to <hi>Zion,</hi> to whom, <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, God had promiſed the Redeemer ſhould come; and conſequently, according to what is there noted, in the Type it is ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; but in the Antitype to the Primitive Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> as is evident, becauſe afterward, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. it is ſaid the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould joyn themſelves to her. <hi>Ariſe,</hi> to wit, (taking it as ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon)</hi> out of the Duſt, that low and ſad condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou haſt lain for a long time; rouſe up thy ſelf, and enter into that happy change and advancement which thy God will now bring thee into; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Shine,</hi> be thou now, or thou ſhalt be now in a

joyful, proſperous, and glorious condition: <hi>For the Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee;</hi> That is, the Night of thine Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being at an end, the Day of thy Proſperity begins to dawn, and the Lord is beginning to ſhew forth his Glory, as the Sun doth where it riſeth, in delivering thee out of thy Captivity, to ſettle thee again in thine own Land, or to make thee renowned and glorious. But indeed the expreſſion here uſed ſeems to allude to thoſe Times, when the Glory of the Lord uſed to appear upon the Tabernacle and in the Temple. But now under this Type, the great bliſs of the Primitive Church of Chriſt is here prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended; in regard whereof the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> is here ſtirred up to <hi>ariſe</hi> and <hi>ſhine,</hi> or, <hi>to be enlightened,</hi> as it is in the Margin; namely, with reſpect to that Spiritual Happineſs and Glory, whereto ſhe ſhould be raiſed from an eſtate of Sin and Miſery under the Meſſiah; which is ſet forth in the following words, <hi>for the Light is come,</hi> or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>thy Light cometh, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee;</hi> that is, Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. long ſince promiſed to them, and in whom they had in many reſpects a ſpecial Intereſt; Or, the Goſpel which was to ſucceed in the ſtead of the abrogated Law, called, <hi>the light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. Or, that bleſſed and joyful eſtate whereto the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was then advanced.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For behold the Darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People,</hi> &amp;c] To wit, you the whilſt enjoying great and marvellous light, as it followes in the next words: <hi>But the Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee, and his Glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee:</hi> And this is added, the better to ſet forth the greatneſs of their approaching happineſs, that whilſt other Nations ſhould be overwhelmed with thick darkneſs, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they ſhould be as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> that had Light in their Dwellings. Now though this (in the Type) was accompliſhed, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were in a lightſome comfortable condition at their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord then appearing graciouſly amongſt them, and ſhining favourably upon them, and cauſing <hi>his Glory</hi> to be clearly diſcovered upon them in that their wonderful deliverance; whilſt the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and other Neighbour Nations were under the diſmal darkneſs of ſore tribulations, being ſubdued and waſted by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who ſet them free: Yet queſtioneleſs it is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the happineſs of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when Chriſt ſhould come to them, above all the Nations of the World beſides, in that whilſt this <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs; Mal.</hi> 4.2. ſhould ariſe and ſhine upon them, and diſpel all the Darkneſs of their blindneſs and miſery, by the light of the Goſpel, whilſt all the World beſides ſhould lye in darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy Light,</hi> &amp;c.] In the Type this may be meant of the great reſpect that ſhould be ſhewn to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their wondrous and glorious return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> by Forreign Nations and Kings; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.6, 7. But with reſpect of the Antitype, it is principally doubtleſs meant of the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their being enlightened by the Goſpel, firſt Preached amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:42788:275"/>
ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3. Even theſe Nations ſhould be ſo far from being Enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as formerly they had been, that they ſhould joyn themſelves to them, and profeſs the ſame Faith, and be one People with them; <hi>and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing;</hi> that is, Heathen Kings ſhall come in to thee, becauſe of the brightneſs that ſhall riſe upon thee; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy brightneſs when thou ſhalt ariſe in great Glory from a low condition; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Lift up thine Eyes round about, and ſee, all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken to ſet forth, as by way of admiration, the Multitude of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, that ſhould from all Countries round about come flocking in, and joyn themſelves to the Primitive Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3. and 14.1. and 43.5. but eſpecially <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.22. though they were of ſeveral Nations, and formerly at great enmity amongſt themſelves, yet ſhould come in willingly together, and joyn themſelves to be one Church with the Chriſtian <hi>Jews.</hi> Some I know underſtand this of the <hi>Jews</hi> flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home from all Countries, whither they had fled, or were carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. But if this ſhould be intended in the Type, yet certainly it is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the relation the words have to the foregoing Verſe doth clearly ſhew. And ſo I underſtand alſo the following words; <hi>Thy Sons ſhall come from far, and thy Daughters ſhall be nurſed at thy ſide;</hi> that is, carried in thine Arms and Boſom; namely, that the Children of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be brought into the Church of Chriſt, as their Mother.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Then thou ſhalt ſee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou ſhalt feed thine Eyes with this pleaſing ſight of the Multitude of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that ſhall come in to thee, (it is ſpoken with reference to that in the foregoing Verſe, <hi>Lift up thine Eyes round about, and ſee) and flow together,</hi> that is, flock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to behold ſuch a joyful ſight; <hi>and thine Heart ſhall fear;</hi> to wit, with admiration, at the unexpectedneſs of the thing done, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the High and Glorious Eſtate, whereto God had ſuddenly raiſed them, eſpecially by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And indeed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and unexpected joys do uſually work a kind of fear and trembling of Heart in Men; ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.26, 27. Whence is that <hi>they ſhall fear and tremble for all the Goodneſs, and for all the Proſperity, that I procure unto it.</hi> Jer. 33.9. And therefore are theſe here joyned together, <hi>and thine Heart ſhall fear and be inlarged;</hi> to wit, with joy; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. And indeed though the believing <hi>Jews</hi> did at firſt grudge at the admitting of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Church, before they underſtood the will of God herein, yet afterward they did greatly rejoice in it; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10.45. and 11.18. <hi>Becauſe the abundance of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. It is in the Margin, <hi>becauſe the noiſe of the Sea ſhall be turned toward thee;</hi> that is, a Multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall come in like a Sea upon thee. But reading it, as it is in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: <hi>Becauſe the abundance of the Sea ſhall be Converted unto thee;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Church of the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be affected, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, becauſe ſuch Multitudes of Forreign Nations ſhould embrace
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:42788:275"/>
their Religion, and be kindly affected to them, whom they hated before, bountifully imparting of their Riches for the ſervice of Chriſt, and his Church and People: <hi>The Forces of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee;</hi> that is, whole Armies or Troops of them ſhall come in to thee: This alſo (in the Type) many underſtand of the forwardneſs of the Nations to help the <hi>Jews</hi> at their return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and ſome would have the meaning to be, that <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould become a great Mart for Merchants by Sea: But the foregoing Expoſition doth moſt clearly ſuit with the whole current of this Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>The multitude of Camels ſhall cover thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thy Land; <hi>the Dromedaries of</hi> Midian <hi>and</hi> Ephah; that is, the <hi>Midianites</hi> (for <hi>Ephah</hi> was alſo of the Poſterity of <hi>Midian, Gen.</hi> 25.4.) who inhabited <hi>Arabia;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.28. The meaning is, that the Converted Gentiles ſhould honour the Lord with their Subſtance, and Conſecrate themſelves, and all that they had, to the Service of Chriſt and his Church. And accordingly the ſeveral Nations are here ſaid to bring in thoſe things, that were the choiceſt Commodities of their ſeveral Countries. The meaning here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, that theſe <hi>Midianites,</hi> Embracing the Faith of Chriſt, ſhould ride to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon Camels and Dromedaries, but becauſe in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, they uſed to ride and to carry great Burdens of Wares upon this kind of Cattel, and becauſe in thoſe days Men uſed not to come empty handed to the Houſe of God, therefore the Coming in of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> their ſubmitting themſelves, and all they had to the Lords diſpoſing, and their contributing of their Wealth in abundance, to the Church of Chriſt, is thus figuratively expreſſed, that the Land of Gods People ſhould be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Camels and Dromedaries. And to the ſame purpoſe is that which follows, <hi>all they from Sheba ſhall come;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10. <hi>They ſhall bring Gold and Incenſe;</hi> that is, they ſhall alſo Conſecrate their Wealth to the Lord; yea, and ſome would have it, that under theſe, Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, the dedicating of their Learning, and Eloquence, their Arts and Sciences to the ſervice of Chriſt and his Church, is alſo comprehended; <hi>and they ſhall ſhew forth the praiſes of the Lord;</hi> that is, they ſhall worſhip God. And indeed, this laſt clauſe ſheweth plainly, that the mention made in the foregoing Words of their bringing Gold and Incenſe with them, was not with reſpect to Trading, as ſome have thought, but with reſpect to the worſhip and ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>All the Flocks of</hi> Kedar, <hi>ſhall be gathered together unto thee: The Rams of</hi> Nebaioth <hi>ſhall Miniſter unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe the <hi>Kedarens</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathaeans, Iſhmaelites</hi> of the Poſterity of <hi>Kedar</hi> and <hi>Nebaioth,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> abounded in Flocks of Sheep, therefore it is ſaid, that from them multitudes of theſe ſhall be brought in to Gods People. And though (in the Type) this again may be meant of theſe Nations, ſupplying the <hi>Jews</hi> that were come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> abundantly with Cattel for <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> But certainly it is principally meant of the Converted <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt underſtand it, either that they ſhould zealouſly promote the Church of Chriſt, and the worſhip of God therein, by contributing abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Subſtance thereto, or that they ſhould offer up Spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:42788:276"/>
unto God: for it is uſual with the Prophets in ſpeaking to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſet forth the Worſhip of the Goſpel under Figurative tearms taken from their Legal Service; <hi>they ſhall come up with acceptance upon mine Altar;</hi> that is, their Services ſhall be as Sacrifices acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>and I will glorify the houſe of my Glory;</hi> that is, in the Type, his glorious Houſe, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built for his Glory, and wherein he had appeared often with great Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, now trodden down by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to be raiſed up again gloriouſly at the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Babylon:</hi> or rather, the Church of Chriſt; the Houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. which God did many ways Glorifie; but the acceſs of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> is principally here intended; ſee the Note, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Who are theſe,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophet (ſome think, in the name of the Church, who above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. in this regard, was called upon to lift up her Eyes, and look about) breaks forth here into an admiration at the multitudes of thoſe that ſhould come flocking into <hi>Zion.</hi> And though ſome underſtand it of the <hi>Jews</hi> returning to their own Country, at their deliverance out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> as they do a like expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.21. (of which ſee the Note there) yet indeed the very words ſeem to hint, that he ſpeaks of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> coming in to the Chriſtian Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of them, as a People unknown, ſuch as were Aliens and Strangers from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael: Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</hi> that is, the Lockers, where they make their ſeveral Neſts, and breed their Young ones; or rather the loover-holes in the Turrets or tops of the Dove-houſe, whereby they fly into it. Now the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Church may be compared to the flying of <hi>a Cloud,</hi> to imply their coming in from remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, becauſe Clouds do many times ariſe in the fartheſt parts of the Sky; and to the flying in of <hi>Doves to their windows,</hi> becauſe as Doves do uſually fly home, when they ſee a ſtorm coming, or are in danger of ſome Bird of prey, ſo it ſhould be the fear of wrath to come, that ſhould bring in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Church, as to a place of refuge and ſafety. But queſtionleſs, the main intent of both Similitudes, is to ſet forth with what eagerneſs, chearfulneſs, and ſpeed, (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.1.) and likewiſe, in what multitudes they ſhould come in, like a huge flight of Doves, that cover the Air like a Cloud, or like a Cloud that ſometimes will ſpread and cover the whole face of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Surely the Iſles,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſuch as dwell in remote Iſlands, or elſewhere on the Sea-Coaſt; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.1. This ſeems to be ſpoken in the Perſon of God, or Chriſt, in anſwer to the wonder of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or Church, in the foregoing Verſe; <hi>Surely the Iſles wait for me;</hi> that is, being convinced of the danger of their natural condition, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, they ſhall earneſtly long to be brought home, and reconciled with me; and therefore it is no wonder, though they come in flocking to me. But ſee the Notes alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.4. and 51.5. <hi>and the Ships of</hi> Tarſhiſh (ſee the Notes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.22. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.7.) <hi>firſt;</hi> that is, the Men of <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> famous above others for Shipping and Navigation, ſhall be of the firſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt, that ſhall be ready to come in to me, and ſerve me; <hi>to bring thy Sons from far;</hi> that is, thy Children, O my Church; ſee the Notes above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.22. <hi>their Silver and their Gold with them;</hi> ſee the Note above,

                  <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>unto the name of the Lord thy God;</hi> that is, to be conſecrated to God, or for the Service of his Church, or Temple; ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.4. <hi>and to the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6. <hi>becauſe he hath glorified thee;</hi> to wit, by the great things he hath done for thee, and particularly by enlarging thy Church by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> But ſee the Notes before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And the Sons of Strangers ſhall build up thy Walls,</hi> &amp;c.] This in the type was accompliſhed, when at the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the forreign Nations did afford them Free-will-offerings towards the building of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple, being encouraged thereunto, by the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cyrus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.4. (notwithſtanding the oppoſition that was made againſt them herein, by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> at their return home; yet thus far by the help afforded them by ſtrangers this Prophecy was fulfilled) and likewiſe when the Proſelytes of other Nations returning with them, did join with them in repairing both their City and Temple; and the like may be ſaid of the following words, <hi>and their Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee;</hi> that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the favour afforded the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and ſome of his Succeſſors. But now in the Antitype this was clearly fulfilled, when God raiſed up, even amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Learned Men, that by their preaching and writing, and Princes that by their bounty and favour, ſhould much promote the Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and advance her ſtrength and glory; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.23. <hi>for in my wroth I ſmote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.</hi> This was ſpoken of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, whom for their ſins God did often ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflict for a time, but afterward of his Free-grace ſhewed favour to them, both in their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in that greater Mercy of their Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Therefore thy Gates ſhall be open continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may from every ſide come in and join themſelves in one Church with thee; (none being excluded that ſhall in a right manner tender themſelves) and that they may, by night as well as by day, bring in their Wealth to thee. And indeed that this is intended, appears by the following words, which are added to explain that which went before; <hi>that men may bring unto thee the forces</hi> (or <hi>wealth) of the Gentiles;</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>and that their Kings may be brought;</hi> that is, that not only the common ſort of People, but even their Kings alſo, who are uſually fierce, and not eaſily won this way; or that, to do any thing contrary to their own Wills, may be brought in to thee, to ſtoop to the Goſpel and Scepter of Chriſt: And indeed the word here uſed in the Original may be underſtood, either of their being brought in to the Church in the State, and with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of Kings; or of their being brought in as Captives, ſubdued by the Preaching of the Goſpel, to ſtoop to the yoke of Chriſt; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.8. Even this alſo indeed ſome underſtand of the Type: As namely, that it is ſaid that the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould ſtand open continually, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to imply the great confluence of the Nations round about thither, upon the <hi>Jews</hi> return thither from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the readineſs both of the People and their Kings, to contribute liberally to their help. But we may eaſily ſee how much more
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:42788:277"/>
clearly this ſuits with the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon the Preaching of the Goſpel. And as for the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi>'s citing this place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.25. to ſet forth the peace of the Church triumphant in Heaven, the ground of that is only, becauſe the Apoſtle knew that the Prophet ſpeaks here of that Glory of the Church of Chriſt, which ſhall be perfected in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>For the Nation,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, nor ſhall theſe thy open Gates endanger thee, by letting in thine Enemies upon thee; <hi>for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kingdom, that will not ſerve thee;</hi> that is, all People that will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Goſpel and Scepter of Chriſt, erected in thee; <hi>ſhall periſh,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſhall everlaſtingly periſh. Nor can this indeed be any way well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> returning out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but with reſpect to what ſhe ſhould come afterward to be in the days of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The Glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>ſhall come unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that all Cedars, and other goodly Trees, which make <hi>Lebanon</hi> look ſo Gloriouſly, ſhall be brought in to thee; <hi>the Firre-tree, and the Pine-tree, and the Box together;</hi> ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.19. <hi>to beautifie the place of my Sanctuary;</hi> to wit, the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſee <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7.27. <hi>and I will make the place of my Feet glorious;</hi> that is, my Foot-ſtool, my Temple, as is before ſaid; for though the Ark is in ſome places more eſpecially called Gods Foot-ſtool; for which ſee the Notes, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.5. yet the Temple is elſe-where alſo called Gods Foot-ſtool, as in <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.1. where the deſtruction of the Temple is thus ſet forth; That <hi>the Lord remembred not his Foot-ſtool in the day of his anger;</hi> and ſo likewiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7. So that in the Type, the rebuilding and beautifying of the Temple, after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> is clearly here meant; ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.7. But in the Antitype, it is certainly meant of the edifying of the Church of Chriſt, his Spiritual Temple and Foot-ſtool, his ſetled dwelling-place; and God here promiſeth a continual ſupply of whatever might tend to the ſtrengthening and adorning of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The Sons alſo of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee; and all they that deſpiſed thee ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoles of thy Feet,</hi> &amp;c.] Though there was ſome dark ſhadow of the accompliſhment of this in the great reſpect and honour, which was yielded to the <hi>Jews</hi> after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> by many Nations with their Kings, that had formerly been their bitter Enemies; yet the full and clear accompliſhment of it was in the great honour which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Kings ſhould yield to Chriſt and his Church; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.23. <hi>and they ſhall call thee the City of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. that is, they ſhall own the ſpecial intereſt which thou haſt in God, being convinced by his appearing ſo wonderfully for thee.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Whereas thou haſt been forſaken and hated, ſo that no man went through thee,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, diſregarded and in a deſolate condtion; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.26. and 3.11, 12. <hi>I will make thee an eternal excellency;</hi> or, a laſting excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that is, I will bring thee into a moſt excellent and glorious eſtate; and this, I conceive, muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, from the time of her deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> till ſhe came to be made glorious by becoming the Spouſe of Chriſt, and ſo on forward unto the end of Chriſts Kingdom.
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:42788:277"/>
It is meant of the Spiritual excellency of the Church here, and of her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Glory in Heaven hereafter. And are to the ſame purpoſe, the following Words, <hi>a joy of many Generations;</hi> namely, that the exceeding happineſs of the Church, ſhould be the joy of Gods People, from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo ſuck the milk of the Gentiles, and ſhalt ſuck the Breaſt of Kings,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Heathens, with their Kings, that before ſought to devour thee, ſhall then with much tender love, nouriſh and ſupport and defend thee; ſee the the Note, <hi>Chap</hi> 49.23. As likewiſe for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clauſe, <hi>And thou ſhalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the mighty one of</hi> Jacob.

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>For Braſs I will bring Gold, and for Iron I will bring Silver, and for Wood Braſs, and for Stones Iron,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thou ſhalt be brought into a far more happy excellent and glorious condition, than ever thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyedſt formerly; we cannot ſay that this was ſo with the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> that returned out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore it muſt be extended to this Church, when ſhe became Chriſtian; when her condition was indeed tranſcendently bettered, becauſe then inſtead of Carnal Ceremonies, they had more Noble Spiritual Ordinances, whereby Remiſſion of Sins, Adoption, Sanctification and Life Eternal, were tendered and conveyed to them, and becauſe theſe the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be more abundantly than ever, and in a more glorious manner poured forth upon them; <hi>I will make thy Officers Peace, and thine Exacters Righteouſneſs;</hi> That is, whereas in former days thou wert diſturbed and oppreſſed by thy Governours and their Officers; or, whereas in <hi>Babylon</hi> thou wert miſerably cruſhed by cruel Task-maſters, then thou ſhalt have ſuch Righteous Rulers and Officers, that thou ſhalt live Peaceably and Comfortably under them. And this was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yl accompliſhed in thoſe juſt and peaceable Governours, that God ſet over them after their return out of <hi>Babylon, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and others, that did indeed ſolely ſtudy and ſeek the Proſperity and Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But eſpecially I conceive it is meant of thoſe Church Officers and Rulers in the days of the Goſpel, that ſhould pacifie the Conſciences of Men, by Preaching Peace and Righteouſneſs to them through Jeſus Chriſt, and of thoſe Chriſtian-Magiſtrates, that ſhould Govern the Church with great Juſtice and Peace; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy Land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy Borders:</hi>] Having foretold in the foregoing Verſe, how juſtly and peaceably their Governours ſhould Rule over them, this is added as the effect hereof; to wit, that there ſhould not any more be heard in their Land the Outcries and Complaints of the poor People, either becauſe of the Violence and Oppreſſion of their Rulers, or becauſe of the waſting of their Land, by Forreign Enemies breaking in upon them. But now if this be underſtood of the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it muſt be taken as ſpoken Comparatively, that there ſhould be no more ſuch complaint of their oppreſſions, as was at preſent amongſt them, or as was when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged and deſtroyed, or as when they were Captives
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:42788:278"/>
in <hi>Babylon:</hi> Yea if we underſtand it (as I conceive it is principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of the Church of Chriſt, either it muſt be underſtood of ſuch a violence and deſtruction, whereby the Church ſhould be utterly Ruined and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; which all the powers of Hell ſhall never be able to effect: Or elſe it muſt be extended to the perfect Peace and Safety of the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in Heaven; (which ſeems the more probable, becauſe of that which is added in the following Verſes) for indeed, though the Goſpel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtians Peace and Righteouſneſs, yet it cannot be denyed, but that there is too much Violence and Oppreſſion amongſt them. And beſides it is evident, that Enemies do often break in upon them, waſte and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou ſhalt call thy Walls Salvation, and thy Gates Praiſe.</hi>] The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Walls and Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould through the Bleſſing of God, be a means of ſure preſervation to them, and give them occaſion of frequent bleſſing God in their Gates; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.14. though ſome would have it, that <hi>Praiſe</hi> is promiſed in their <hi>Gates,</hi> to imply, that the Juſtice adminiſtred in their Gates, ſhould be the great cauſe of their praiſing God. And the Words may alſo be underſtood, as if they had been expreſſed thus, that Gods Salvation ſhould be inſtead of Walls and Gates to them, and ſhould yield them continual occaſion of praiſing God. But for this ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give Light unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.] It cannot be thought that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſhould ever here in this World live without the Light of the Sun and Moon; but the meaning is, that they ſhould have a Light ſo tranſcendently greater and more lightſom than thoſe, that Comparatively they ſhould not mind, nor eſteem them; namely, the Light of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour ſhining into their hearts in and through the Lord Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who ſhould enlighten their Minds with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Grace, by his Word and Spirit, and thereby fill their heart with exceeding great Joy. And ſo we find this explained in the following Words; <hi>but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting Light;</hi> where alſo in thoſe Words, <hi>an everlaſting Light;</hi> that tranſcendent excellency of this Light is hinted (which is more fully ſet forth in the following Verſe) to wit, that this Light ſhould conſtantly and continually ſhine upon them, without any variation or change, until they were brought at laſt to the Eternal enjoyment of his Preſence in Heavenly Glory. And indeed many there are that hold, that of this laſt, the Glorious and Beatifical preſence of God which the Saints ſhall enjoy in the Life that it to come, this place is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, if not ſolely, to be underſtood; when they ſhall need no outward ordinary means for their Joy and Bliſs, but God ſhall be all in all to them. But ſee the Notes alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.23. <hi>And thy God thy Glory;</hi> that is, thine Intereſt in this great and glorious God through Jeſus Chriſt, and the great things he ſhall do for thee, ſhall be a great honour to thee.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Thy Sun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy Moon withdraw it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, whereas men do not always conſtantly enjoy
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:42788:278"/>
the light of the Sun and Moon, becauſe when they have ſhined their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, they Set again, and are hidden under the Earth; thy Sun and thy Moon, the Light promiſed in the foregoing Verſe, tranſcendently ſurpaſſing the Light of the Sun and Moon, ſhall ſhine upon thee perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without any viciſſitude and interruption, it ſhall never be withdrawn, but ſhall be thy Light, by Night as well as by Day, in the darkneſs of Adverſity, as well as in Proſperity; yea in Heaven unto all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Thy People alſo ſhall be all righteous,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thoſe that are truly ſuch, true Members of the Church, even <hi>all</hi> of them, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles, ſhall be righteous;</hi> to wit, perfectly, by the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt; and really alſo, by inherent righteouſneſs wrought in them, which ſhall be perfected in Heaven. But ſee the Notes alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.3. and 59.20. <hi>they ſhall inherit the Land for ever;</hi> that is, as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> returning from <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſhall poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> again for many Generations; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.18. Leſt that poor Remnant that were brought back from thence ſhould fear, that they ſhould preſently be driven out again, therefore is this promiſe added. But now as this is ſpoken with reſpect to the Church of Chriſt, the meaning of this <hi>Inheriting the Land for ever</hi> muſt needs be, that they ſhould for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the World, as Gods peculiar Church and People, <hi>the new World</hi> (ſay our Divines in their large Annotations) <hi>by Chriſt renewed and reſtored in a ſpecial manner here, in full perfection hereafter;</hi> whereof Gods giving <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their peculiar Inheritance, that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in abide by themſelves, ſeparated from all the World, was a notable Type. As for the following Words, <hi>the Branch of my planting, the Work of mine hands, that I may be glorified;</hi> they are added, as a reaſon why thoſe things muſt needs be ſo which he had here foretold concerning Gods People, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe a Graft planted by the great God muſt needs thrive and proſper; the rather, becauſe of the great delight he muſt needs take in them, even as Men are wont highly to eſteem thoſe Trees that are of their own planting, and eſpecially becauſe his aim in planting them was, that they might be to his glory. But ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>A little One ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.] This is a prediction of the miraculous multiplication of Gods People; to wit, that it ſhould be ſuch, that one Man that had but a little ſmall Family ſhould have ſuch a numerous Poſterity, that his Family ſhould in a ſhort time become like a great Nation. And this may be underſtood as ſpoken, in the Type, of the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhould return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> that though they were but a ſmall Remnant to ſpeak of, yet they ſhould ſoon become again a very numerous People; yet I conceive it is principally meant, in the Antitype of the Church of Chriſt, that though that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little at firſt, yet it ſhould ſuddenly encreaſe, even to admiration. And ſo indeed it was; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. The Apoſtles were but a few: Yet how ſoon had they ſpread the Goſpel to the utmoſt parts of the Earth? One <hi>Peter,</hi> by one Sermon, won three thouſand to the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that terms himſelf, <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <pb n="544" facs="tcp:42788:279"/>
how many Churches were planted by him alone, even in remote Countries. Some would have the firſt branch underſtood of a few growing to great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; <hi>A little one ſhall become a thouſand;</hi> and then the ſecond branch; <hi>and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation,</hi> of Men of mean condition growing up to be potent and mighty Men. But I rather think, that in both branches the ſame thing is intended; for the word rendered <hi>ſtrong,</hi> is ſometimes uſed for numerous; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.14. Again, ſome would have the Spiritual ſenſe of theſe expreſſions to be, that Men even of mean parts, and ſmall gifts of grace, ſhould bring in multitudes to believe in Chriſt. But the firſt Expoſition ſeems to me the cleareſt; <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time;</hi> that is, however impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible this may ſeem to be, yet when the time comes, that is appointed for the doing of it; I the Lord, who have all things under my command, will not defer it, but ſpeedily diſpatch it.</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>THE Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,</hi> &amp;c. It is clear that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth in expreſs tearms ſpeak this of himſelf. That the People might with the more confidence believe what he had ſaid to them, he aſſures them, that God had endued him with the Spirit of Propheſie, and had ſent him to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for the comfort of his poor People, when they ſhould be there in great affliction and miſery. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me;</hi> that is, he hath poured forth the Spirit of Propheſie upon me, by the enabling whereof I ſpeak; <hi>becauſe the Lord hath anointed me;</hi> that is, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and ſet me apart to be his Prophet, and accordingly fitted me with gifts ſuitable thereto, whereof the anointing of Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets of old was a ſign; ſee the Notes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.15. <hi>to preach good tydings unto the meek;</hi> that is, the tydings of their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon; he hath ſent me to bind up</hi> (that is, to heal; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3.) <hi>the broken-hearted;</hi> that is, the poor broken-hearted Captives in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And ſo we muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtand all that follows, <hi>to proclaim liberty to the Captives,</hi> &amp;c. Well, but now as clear it is alſo, that the Prophet ſpeaks this likewiſe as in the Perſon of Chriſt, of whom he was a Type; and that becauſe in the firſt Sermon our Saviour preached at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> having read this Text out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he told his Hearers, that the Prophet ſpake thoſe words of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.21. <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</hi> And of him therefore principally this place muſt be underſtood. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me;</hi> for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>becauſe the Lord hath anointed me;</hi> that is, ſet me apart to the office of the Mediator, and abundantly fitted me for it, by the pouring forth of the gifts of his Spirit upon me, whereof the anointing of Kings,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:42788:279"/>
Prieſts, and Prophets was an outward ſign. But for this ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>to Preach good tydings unto the Meek;</hi> or, as it is cited, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. out of the Septuagint (and they or both one and the ſame in effect) <hi>to Preach the Goſpel to the Poor;</hi> that is, to Men poor in Spirit, meekned and humbled with the ſight and ſenſe of their Sins, and the Miſeries they were obnoxious to by reaſon of their Sins; <hi>he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted;</hi> that is, to <hi>heal</hi> them, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. To wit, by comforting them with the glad tydings of the Goſpel, <hi>to proclaim liberty to the Captives;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.7. <hi>And the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound;</hi> which laſt Clauſe ſeems to be rendred in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>and recovering of ſight to the Blind;</hi> the reaſon whereof Expoſitors uſually ſay, is, becauſe Men ſet free out of dark Priſons have as it were their Eyes opened thereby. But ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.7. and 49.9. Yea there is one Clauſe more in that place of <hi>Luke,</hi> where our Saviour is ſaid to have read this Text out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which is not here; <hi>to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed;</hi> of which therefore ſome ſay, that it had been added in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Septuagint, by way of explaining the foregoing words, and ſo was read alſo by our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>To proclaim the acceptable Year of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the ſet time, when God would accept of his People into his favour again, which though it might be intended of the time appointed for the deliverance of his People out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet queſtionleſs it is principally meant of that ſet time, appointed by God (the Apoſtle calls it <hi>the fullneſs of time; Gal.</hi> 4 4.) Wherein God was pleaſed of his own free Grace, upon ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, to tender unto poor Sinners forgiveneſs of Sins and full Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with himſelf, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, which is indeed a time welcome and acceptable unto thoſe poor Souls, that lay groaning under a heavy burden of Sin; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.8. It is probable that in the words there is an alluſion to the year of Jubile, which was a Type of the Days of the Goſpel; for which ſee the Notes, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.10. &amp;c. <hi>And the day of Vengeance of our God;</hi> that is, the time when our God will take vengeance on the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the Enemies of his people; or Myſtically when Chriſt will deſtroy the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies of his People, Satan, Sin, and Death, and ſo reſcue his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ple out of their Bondage; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 59.17, 18.

Bravery, or ſuch Garments as Men are wont to weare on Feſtivals and times of Triumph, when thy meet together to praiſe God for ſome great Mercies; <hi>that they might be called Trees of Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, that thoſe that were as Trees cut down to the ground or ſpiritually dead, might ſprout up again and flouriſh, and both be, and be eſteemed a Righteous People; <hi>The planting of the Lord, that he might be Glorified;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 60.21.</p>

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And Strangers ſhall ſtand and feed your Flocks,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, you ſhall be in ſuch a proſperous condition, that the Heathens, whether taken in War, or bought, or hired by you, ſhall chearfully and readily ſerve you even in the meaneſt and moſt ſervile Imployments; and ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1, 2.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>But ye ſhall be named the Prieſts of the Lord, Men ſhall call you the Miniſters of our God,</hi> &amp;c.] Some (I conceive without any juſt ground) would have this underſtood particularly of the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> thus, that they ſhould be no more deſpiſed and abuſed, as they had been in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (it is like, above the other Captives) but that they ſhould be highly eſteemed amongſt the People, <hi>as the Prieſts of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and Servants <hi>of God;</hi> for queſtionleſs the Prophet ſpeaks here, as before to the whole people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and accordingly the intent of the words is to ſhew them, that however baſely they had been uſed and eſteemed in <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet, 1. When God delivered them from thence, they ſhould be honoured abroad, and in as great repute, as if they had been all Prieſts, a Holy People conſecrated to Gods Service, and in ſpecial favour with God; See the Notes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. And, 2.

And thus ſome conceive that the following words are added by way of explaining theſe; <hi>and for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they;</hi> that is the <hi>Jews</hi> (the perſon is changed as often, elſewhere in this Prophet) for the reproach they underwent, <hi>ſhall rejoyce in their Portion;</hi> that is, in their returning to, and poſſeſſing again that Land, which God had of old given them for their Portion and Inheritance; <hi>therefore in their Land they ſhall poſſeſs the double;</hi> that is, double Glory, as is before ſaid, or a double Portion in the Land; to wit, in regard of the extraordinary Bleſſing of God upon that which they enjoyed; or in regard of the large extent of each ones Portion, in compariſon of what they formerly held; becauſe there was but only a ſmall Remnant of them that returned, a Tenth of them only, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.13. the greateſt part of them being waſted and deſtroyed, partly by the Sword and Famine in their own Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were carried away Captives, and partly in their Captivity; by reaſon whereof they that returned had the Firſt-borns Portion, a double Portion; <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be unto them;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.10. Well, but now there was but only a beginning of the performance of this promiſe in the deliverance of Gods People out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home into their own Country; the perfect accompliſhment of it was under Chriſt in the Days of the Goſpel, partly in this World, but chiefly in Heaven: Referring it therefore to the <hi>Jews</hi> when they became the Church of Chriſt, we muſt thus underſtand this place; <hi>For your ſhame ye ſhall have double;</hi> that is, for the ſhame you have undergone amongſt your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies (whether the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or thoſe that ſhall hate and deſpiſe you, both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for your profeſſion of Chriſtianity and Preaching of the Goſpel; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, 3) You ſhall be abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, your Honour and Bliſs ſhall be double to what your Shame and Miſery was, and that particularly by the acceſs of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the great Riches and Glory which they ſhall bring in to you, of which the Prophet had before ſpoken: <hi>And for confuſion they;</hi> that is, my People; <hi>ſhall rejoyce in their Portion;</hi> that is, in God, ſay ſome, who is the Portion of his people; or in the bringing in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be one Church and People with them, ſay others; but I conceive it is generally meant of that abundant double Honour and Bliſs, which they ſhould enjoy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their former Shame and Miſery, in and through the Lord Chriſt, partly in this World, and eſpecially in Heaven; for under this the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going particulars, and any other that can be added, may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Therefore in their Land,</hi> that is, in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the glad Tydings of Chriſt ſhould be Preached firſt amongſt them, and embraced by them; or, in the Land of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that did formerly reproach and deſpiſe them, the ſeveral Countries where the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall embrace the Faith, and joyn themſelves to the Church of Chriſt; or in the Earth, which is indeed only the Inheritance of Believers; ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.9.29. Or, in Heaven, ſay ſome, <hi>they ſhall poſſeſs the double;</hi> that is, the double Portion before promiſed them; <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be unto them;</hi> that is, not momentary Joy, as is the Joy of the wicked, but a laſting Joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

here in the joy of their Salvation and Eternal in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For I the Lord love Judgment,</hi> &amp;c.] All the difficulty in this Verſe is to find out how it comes in, here in this place: Some take the words to be added, as a reaſon of the foregoing Promiſes made to his People, thus, <hi>For I the Lord love judgment, I hate Robbery for Burnt-Offering;</hi> that is, I ſo love equal, juſt, and upright dealing, that though Men ſhould being that which they have gotten by Robbery and Oppreſſion, and tender it to me in Sacrifices and Offerings, I ſhould loath and abhor them; <hi>and I will direct their work in truth;</hi> that is, and therefore I will faithfully and conſtantly reward my People, (for the word here rendered <hi>Work</hi> is often uſed for <hi>a Recompence,</hi> or <hi>Reward;</hi> See <hi>Chap,</hi> 40.10. Or, I will order all their Affairs ſo that they ſhall go on in a proſperous and ſucceſsful way. The drift of the words, they ſay, is this; that ſeeing he loved juſt, and hated all unjuſt dealing, he could not with Equity do otherwiſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and proſper his faithful People; to wit, 1. Thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that had under ſo long and grievous Sufferings continued faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and upright in his Service; Or, 2. Thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſhould ſo willingly offer themſelves, and all that they had to his Service. But then again others (I think moſt probably) hold that there is in theſe words a promiſe of a further Mercy, that God would confer upon his People; namely, that God would make them upright and ſincere in his Service: The ground of this promiſe is laid down in the firſt words; <hi>For I the Lord love Judgment, I hate Robbery for Burnt-Offering;</hi> that is, I love that which is juſt and right, and conſequently I hate all Hypocriſie and falſe dealing in my Worſhip and Service, ſuch as is now too uſual amongſt my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that make nothing of Rapine and Robbery, ſo that they can cover it over with a ſhew of Devotion in my Service, and bring of that which they have thus wickedly gotten, and offer it in Sacrifice upon mine Altar: And then they ſay, the promiſe follows, made to his Redeemed People, of whom he had hitherto ſpoken; <hi>And I will direct their work in Truth;</hi> that is, I will make them upright and ſincere in my Worſhip, and in their whole Converſation; they ſhall not be as it is now, a wicked People, and then think to cloke that, with making a ſhew of Piety in bringing Offerings to mine Altar: And indeed obſervable it is, that under this promiſe there may be a hint given to Gods People, how they ought to be qualified, to make them capable of the Mercies here promiſed them: <hi>And I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with them;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 55.3.</p>

at the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2. yet its full accompliſhment was at the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> when indeed thoſe that profeſſed the Faith of Chriſt, were, partly for their Holy and Righteous Converſation, and partly for the great things that God did for them, highly eſteemed and owned to be Gods peculiar People; <hi>all that ſee them ſhall acknowledg them, that they are the Seed which the Lord hath bleſſed;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44.3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>I will greatly reioyce in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God,</hi> &amp;c.] The Church is here brought in triumphing and rejoycing in the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to them, upon the Accompliſhment of thoſe great Mercies promiſed in the foregoing Verſes; to wit, their deliverance out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and their Redemption by Chriſt; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.2. <hi>For he hath Cloathed me with the Garments of Salvation;</hi> That is, with Salvation, as with a Garment; by the great Redemption and Salvation he hath wrought for me, he hath made me as Glorious in the Eyes of thoſe that behold me, as if I were Cloathed with the moſt Gorgeous and Glorious Apparel; and to the ſame purpoſe are the following words; <hi>He hath covered me with the Robe of Righteouſneſs;</hi> for by <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> here nothing elſe is meant, but the diſcovery of Gods Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs in the Work of their Salvation; which indeed tended much to their Glory; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.6. Only now, as we intend it to that great work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, begun here, but perfected in Heaven, it may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applyed to that Evangelical Righteouſnes wherewith Chriſtians may be truly ſaid to be Cloathed; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 60.21. This I conceive is the true meaning of this place; yet I know there are ſome that would have nothing elſe intended thereby, but only this, that God had changed their Captive Garments into the joyful Attire of thoſe that are delivered out of Captivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>For as the Earth bringeth forth her Bud, and as the Garden cauſeth the things that are ſown in it to Spring forth,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, when the Winter is gone and the Spring is come; <hi>So the Lord God will cauſe Righteouſneſs and Praiſe to Spring forth before all the Nations;</hi> that is, ſo, though God may hide himſelf from his People for a time, yet when he begins to let the light of his Countenance ſhine forth favourably upon them again, he will cauſe your Land in the ſight of all Nations to abound with <hi>Righteouſneſs and Praiſe;</hi> that is, with the diſcovery of his Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs to you, and the Praiſe that ſhall thereupon be given to him; as if theſe things did grow and ſpring up every where out of the Earth; ſee the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.3. and 85.11. The Land ſhall be covered with Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Praiſe, as the Earth is with the Fruits that grow up in the Spring time. But ſee alſo the foregoing Note.

                  </gap>e would not ceaſe inceſſantly to proclaim theſe things, that hereby he might raiſe up their Hearts conſtantly to wait for this promiſed deliverance and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though it might be long er'e it came, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Righteouſneſs thereof goeth forth as brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth;</hi> that is, (as it reſpects the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon)</hi> until by Gods deſtroying the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and his Peoples Deliverance, the Righteouſneſs of his Peoples Cauſe, which lay hid during their Captivity, ſhall appear ſo clearly and gloriouſly, that all the Nations about them ſhall ſee and acknowledge it. Or, (as it reſpects the Church of Chriſt) until Chriſt come, who is the Righteouſneſs and Saviour of his People, until the great Work of the Righteouſneſs and Salvation of the Church be fully accompliſhed, and do ſhine forth gloriouſly in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, to the drawing of all Mens Eyes to it, even amongſt <hi>Gentiles</hi> that before ſat in groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some think that this is ſpoken by the Prophet in the Perſon of God; <hi>For</hi> Zions <hi>ſake I will not hold my peace,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, that God would not reſt, till he had pleaded the Righteous Cauſe of his People and ſaved them from their Enemies; (for when he doth forbear to do this, he is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phraſe ſaid to hold his peace; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.14.) Yea, they ſay, that it cannot be ſpoken by the Prophet in his own Perſon, becauſe he dyed long before the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and much more before the full accompliſhment of theſe things by Jeſus Chriſt. But this is not a ſufficient reaſon to diſprove what is moſt generally held by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors; to wit, that the Prophet ſpeaks here in his own Perſon; ſince his meaning here may be only this, that ſhould he live till theſe things, which God had promiſed his People, ſhould come to paſs, he would never ceaſe to Preach theſe glad tydings, nor to Pray for the ſpeedy performance of
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:42788:282"/>
them. It is not unlike that Speech of the Apoſtles; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>We, which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds;</hi> that is, ſhould any of us at that day be found living upon Earth, it would be ſo with us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall ſee thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, which ſhould <hi>go forth as brightneſs;</hi> for which ſee the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Note; <hi>and all Kings thy Glory;</hi> that is, all the great Kings of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom the knowledge of it ſhall come, ſhall take notice of the exceeding Glory whereto God hath advanced thee; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.4. <hi>And thou ſhalt be called by a new Name, which the Mouth of the Lord ſhall Name;</hi> that is, God will give thee a new Name; to wit, that expreſſed afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt be called</hi> Hephzi-bah. But the meaning is, either that Gods Church and People ſhould, through his favour to them, become exceeding Famous and Renowned, far more than ever formerly; Or, that God would bring them into a new Eſtate and Condition, far more glorious than ever formerly heard of; which was moſt fully accompliſhed, when they became the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the Hand of thy God.</hi>) The meaning is, either, 1. That the Lord by his Hand upon them in their Deliverance, and in the great things he would do for them, as his peculiar People, would advance them to great Glory, ſo that they ſhould be eminently conſpicuous and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even as a Glorious Crown or Royal Diadem in the Eyes of thoſe that behold it; or rather, 2. That God would own his People to be an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory to him, even as a Crown or Diadem, which a King takes in his Hand and puts upon his Head, as being the people over whom he Reigned as their King and Soveraign; and conſequently that he would make as precious account of them, as a King doth of his Crown, and as carefully preſerve them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt no more be termed, forſaken,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.14 and 54.6, 7. <hi>Neither ſhall thy Land any more be termed deſolate;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. and 54.3. <hi>But thou ſhalt be called,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be, and ſhalt be owned to be (as we ſee in the like Expreſſion uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt; See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>Hephzi-bah;</hi> that is, <hi>my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in her:</hi> It was the very Name of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Wife, the Mother of <hi>Manaſſah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.1. But here the intent of it is, that God of his own free grace ſhould greatly delight in his Church and People; <hi>and thy Land</hi> Beulah; that is, <hi>Married; for the Lord Delighteth in thee; and thy Land ſhall be Married;</hi> that is, Whereas thy Land hath been bereaved of her People, and ſo hath ſat for many years as a lone Woman without Children, thou ſhalt now be in the ſtate of a Married Wife that hath a Houſe full of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; becauſe being received into Favour and Communion with God, her Husband, her Land ſhould be abundantly filled with Inhabitants; yea and this may be extended alſo to the great inlargement of the Church under Chriſt in the Days of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:42788:283"/>Ver. 5. <hi>For as a young Man Marrieth a Virgin,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe are named, becauſe the love of ſuch is uſually moſt ſincere and fervent, and they uſually live together with greateſt content, delight and comfort; <hi>So ſhall thy Son Marry thee;</hi> as if he had ſaid, O, <hi>Zion,</hi> O my Church and People, thy Sons ſhall poſſeſs and enjoy thee, as if they were joyned in Marriage with thee, and they ſhall live and dwell with thee as contentedly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as a young Man is wont to live with ſome Beautiful Virgin, whom he hath taken to be his Wife. The intent of the words is to ſhew, that Strangers ſhould not poſſeſs <hi>Zion</hi> any more, but that ſhe ſhould be Inhabited conſtantly by their own Natives, who ſhould rejoice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in her, according to the joy that is betwixt Husband and Wife. This paſſage indeed ſeems to have ſome difficulty in it, that the Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhould be ſaid to Marry their Mother: And therefore ſome, by her Sons here, would have her Governors and Magiſtrates to be meant, who are as a Husband to the State and People. But the Expoſition before given, is, I conceive, clearly that which is here intended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy Walls, O</hi> Jeruſalem, &amp;c.] Here the Lord is brought in ſpeaking to his Church, and telling them, that for their better ſafeguard he had ſet <hi>Watchmen</hi> upon their Walls; that is, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Paſtors, and Teachers; See the notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.11. and 52.8. <hi>Which ſhall never hold their peace Day nor Night;</hi> that is, that ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their Duty, both in Teaching the People, warning them of their danger and duty, and praying to God on their behalf. And then again in the following words the Prophet again ſpeaks; <hi>ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence;</hi> that is, ye amongſt Gods people that are wont to ſpeak of God, and to pray to God, ceaſe not to ſollicite him to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his poor people; Or rather, O ye, the Watchmen of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; that make mention of the Lord;</hi> that put Gods people in mind of God, his grace and goodneſs and promiſes to them, and of their Duty and Obedience; Or, as it is in the Margin of our Bibles; <hi>Ye that are the Lords remembrancers;</hi> that is, ye whoſe Office it is to put God in mind of the concernments of his People, Oh fail not conſtantly to do your Duty herein.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, till he ſettle his Church in a comfortable and laſting Foundation; <hi>and till he make</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth;</hi> that is, till by his wonderful deliverance of his Church, and the glorious condition whereunto he ſhall exalt her, ſhe ſhall be praiſed, extolled, and magnified all the world over; Or, till the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do for this praiſe the Lord; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.3. And though this was in part fulfilled, when Gods people were delivered out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet it was chiefly accompliſhed in the ſpiritual Splendor of the Church of Chriſt, when that was ſpread by the Preaching of the Goſpel throughout the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by his Right Hand,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, by his Faithfulneſs, a token whereof among men is uſually the giving one the Right Hand. But rather <hi>by his Right Hand, and by the Arm of his Strength,</hi>
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:42788:283"/>
is meant his Almighty power; for in regard of the difficulty and ſeeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the things promiſed, God ingageth his Almighty power for the accompliſhment of them; <hi>ſurely I will no more give thy Corn to be Meat for thine Enemies, and the Sons of the Stranger ſhall not drink thy Wine, for the which thou haſt laboured;</hi> that is, thy Proviſions ſhall not any more be a prey to thine Enemies. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>If I give any more thy Corn,</hi> &amp;c. for which Form of an Oath; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. It is all one as if God had ſaid, let me not be eſteemed as an Almighty God, if this be ſo any more. Becauſe even after the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> Enemies did many times ſpoil the <hi>Jews</hi> of their outward proviſions, therefore ſeveral Expoſitors underſtand this ſpiritually; to wit, that the Devil and his Inſtruments ſhall never bereave the Church of thoſe Proviſions whereby their Souls are to be nouriſhed unto Life Eternal. But there is no neceſſity of flying to this Expoſition. It is certainly a promiſe made to Gods People, for their defence, and their peaceable enjoying their Eſtates, contrary to that Curſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.33. Which as it was partly fulfilled when the <hi>Jews</hi> returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo eſpecially under the Kingdom of Chriſt; the Church never was, nor ever ſhall be deprived of neceſſary outward Proviſions, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> And beſides, when Chiſtians are bereaved of their outward Eſtates, the Curſe of that threatning, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. is taken away.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>But they that have gathered it, ſhall eat it, and praiſe the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thy People together with the Harveſt men imployed by them in gathering in their Corn, ſhall eat it, bleſſing God for it; <hi>and they that have brought it together;</hi> that is, the Wine before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>ſhall drink it in the Courts of my Holineſs;</hi> that is, my Sanctuary, or in my Holy Courts, in my Temple; the meaning is, that Gods People ſhould in his Church peaceably enjoy the outward bleſſings God afforded them, praiſing God for them even in their publick Aſſemblies; only in the expreſſions here uſed, there is an alluſion to the Holy Feaſts which the <hi>Jews</hi> kept in the Courts of the Temple; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.7. How this alſo is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by ſome of the Soul proviſions of the Church; ſee in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Note.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Go through, go through the Gates,</hi> &amp;c.] The doubling of this charge imports the doing of what is here enjoyn'd with all ſpeed and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But the great Queſtion is, to whom, and concerning what Gates this is ſpoken. Some conceive that the Inhabitants of <hi>Zion,</hi> the believing <hi>Jews;</hi> (or, <hi>Zions</hi> Watchmen before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel) are here called upon to go out of her Gates to make way for the Gentiles to come into the Church. Again, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the <hi>Jews,</hi> encouraged hereby to preſs and throng in through the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which though formerly broken down or burnt, ſhould at their return ftom <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtand open before them, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. And under this Type they conceive, that the flocking in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> on all ſides to the Church is comprehended; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.2. and 60.11. But becauſe in the following Words, there is mention made
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:42788:284"/>
of preparing the way for the <hi>Jews</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that their preſſing into the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be here ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that; it may be rather thought, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are here preſſed to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſpeedily, and to <hi>go through the Gates</hi> of the ſeveral Cities where they were in Captivity, and to get away to their own Country; which indeed agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well with that which is ſaid elſewhere; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.20. and 52.11. Yea, and ſome too think, that it may be ſpoken to thoſe, to whom the following Words are directed, <hi>prepare you the way of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, caſt up, caſt up the high-way, gather out the Stones;</hi> for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3. <hi>lift up a ſtandard for the People;</hi> ſee the Note <hi>Cap.</hi> 49.22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Behold the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the World,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, that which follows, <hi>ſay ye to the Daughter of</hi> Zion; ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.21. <hi>Behold thy Salvation cometh;</hi> that is, thy Redemption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; or, thy Saviour that ſhall deliver thee; for that this laſt is at leaſt implied, is evident by the following Words; <hi>behold, his reward is with him,</hi> &amp;c. Now as this is ſpoken with reſpect to the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> the meaning is, either, that the Lord had by the Proclamation of <hi>Cyrus</hi> enjoyn'd all Nations ſhould give liberty to his People, to return home to their own Land (which agrees well with that expreſſion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his Proclamation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.2, <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>the Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.) or elſe, that the Lord by the wonderful manner of that deliverance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> would cauſe all Nations even to the end of the World, to underſtand that it was done by his Will and Command. But now as it is ſpoken with reſpect to that great Work of Mans Redemption by Chriſt (whereof the other was a Type) the meaning is, that the Lord had by the preaching of the Goſpel Proclaimed unto all Nations the coming of the promiſed Meſſiah, that ſo they might come in and joyn themſelves to his Church; and indeed that paſſage, <hi>ſay ye to the Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>behold, thy Salvation cometh;</hi> is expreſly applyed to Chriſt by the Evangeliſts, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.5. <hi>behold his Reward is with him, and his Work before him;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And they ſhall call them, the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, upon their miraculous deliverance men ſhall own them to be the People whom God had Sanctified and ſet a part to himſelf, to be his own peculiar People; ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. and whom he had made a Holy People, and redeemed out of the power of their Enemies; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.3. and 60.21. <hi>and thou ſhalt be called;</hi> to wit, thou O <hi>Zion, ſought out;</hi> that is, of her Husband that had caſt her off; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.6, 7. Or one, over whom God took ſpecial care to look after her, and recover her when ſhe was loſt. Or, the meaning may be, that ſhe ſhould be ſought after, as one that was in high eſteem; to wit, by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that ſhould ſeek to joyn themſelves in one Church with her; and ſo it ſhould be no more ſaid of her, as formerly it was; <hi>this is Zion, whom no Man ſeeketh after, Jer.</hi> 30.17. <hi>A City not forſaken;</hi> that is neither caſt off by God, nor left deſolate without People, as formerly ſhe ſeemed to be; ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>WHO is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, &amp;c.] Having in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. ſpoken of the Lords coming to ſave his People, as of a thing ready to be done immediately; <hi>ſay ye to the Daughter of Zion, Behold, thy Salvation cometh; behold his reward is with him,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Church, ſay ſome, or the Prophet rather (as if he had ſeen in a Viſion this great Saviour of his People, the Lord God, like ſome great Prince, coming from the Slaughter of his Enemies, whom he had vanquiſhed in Fight, with his Garments all ſtained with their Blood, breaks forth into this expreſſion of admiration, <hi>who is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, <hi>with Died Garments from</hi> Bozrah? and that ſtill to aſſure Gods People, that it would not be long ere he would come and deliver them, by deſtroying their Enemies. It is queſtioned by Expoſitors, why it is ſaid, that he came <hi>from Edom,</hi> and <hi>from Bozrah,</hi> which was the chief City of <hi>Edom.</hi> That which was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid by the Ancients, that the Prophet ſpeaks this of Chriſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing triumphantly into Heaven after his Bloody paſſion, cannot certainly be here intended, becauſe it is expreſly ſaid afterwards, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that his Garments were Red, not with his own Blood, but with the Blood of his Enemies. Nor is there much probability in that which is ſaid by others, that becauſe <hi>Edom</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Red,</hi> and <hi>Bozrah</hi> ſignifieth <hi>a Vintage,</hi> nothing elſe is intended by ſaying that he came from <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Bozrah;</hi> but that his Garments were Blood-red, like one that having trod a Winepreſs, hath his Garments all over beſprinkled with the Blood of the Grapes; it is therefore far more probable, which ſome others ſay, that it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Literally, concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> that were always bitter Enemies to the <hi>Jews, Pſal.</hi> 137.7. Or, rather that the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> are put for the Enemies of Gods People in General, eſpecially the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and that becauſe the <hi>Edomites</hi> had been ſucceſſively in all Ages profeſſed deadly Enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo had manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and by reaſon of their near Neighbourhood were beſt known to them; ſee the Notes, <hi>Ch.</hi> 34.5, 6. This I conceive is the genuine meaning of the place, that this is ſpoken of God, coming like ſome Victorious Prince, from the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and other his Peoples Enemies, having his Garments beſprinkled with their Blood; yet I queſtion not, but that under theſe Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God over the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and other Enemies of his People, Chriſts Victories over their Spiritual Enemies, were alſo Typified. As for the following Words, they contain a farther Deſcription of this great Saviour
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:42788:285"/>
of his People, <hi>this that is glorious in his Apparel;</hi> that is, Clothed with gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Attire, ſuitable to the dignity of his perſon, and that never a whit the leſs glorious, becauſe ſtained with Blood, this being a ſign of the glorious Victory he had obtained over his Peoples Enemies; <hi>Travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength;</hi> whereby is ſignified, either that he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along the ſeveral Countries of his Peoples Enemies, that he might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and deſtroy them, and that by no other but his own Almighty power; or, that he was going along triumphantly with his People, carrying them away from the ſeveral Countries where they were Captives; or elſe, that he Marched with a ſtately gate, not as one that fled or retired before an Enemy, but as one that had made a perfect diſpatch of his Foes, and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching away fearleſsly in his full ſtrength. And then in the next Words, we have Gods Anſwer to the Prophets Queſtion, <hi>I that ſpeak in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mighty to ſave;</hi> that is, it is I that never promiſe any thing, but what I am ſure to perform, as being Almighty to ſave my People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Wherefore art thou Red in thine Apparel? and thy Garments like him that treadeth in the Wine Fat?</hi>] And ſo hath his Garments made Red with the Blood of the Grapes, as their Juice is called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.11. This is the Second Queſtion, which the Church, or the Prophet rather, propounds to God, that great Saviour whom he had ſeen in a Viſion, and of whom he had ſpoken in the foregoing verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-Preſs alone, and of the People there was none with me,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the Lords Anſwer to the Churches or Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Queſtion; wherein he ſheweth, that it was no wonder, though his Garments were Red, like one that had been treading in a Wine-fat, and that becauſe he had been treading down and deſtroying the Enemies of his People, in the Wine-preſs of his wrath and vengeance, and therefore his Garments might well be beſmeared with Blood. And this he is ſaid to have done <hi>alone,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe, though he made uſe of Men in the doing of it; yet, 1. it was done in ſuch a manner, that all Men might ſee there was a ſpecial hand of God in the doing of it. 2. Men contributed no help to God for the effecting of it. And 3. Men at leaſt minded not at all the doing of it in a way of Revenge upon them for the miſchief which they had done to Gods People. But indeed in the great Work of Mans Redemption, where Chriſt ſubdued our Spiritual Enemies, and reſcued his People from their Bondage (which was Typified in the deliverance of his People out of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage) this was moſt clearly accompliſhed; to wit, that none helped him in that great Work, <hi>for I will tread them in mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. That is, I will with great Indignation utterly deſtroy them, and that as a Man in a Wine-Fat treads the Grapes in pieces under his Feet. And this is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as I conceive, in the Future Tenſe, as a reaſon of that Anſwer which God had given to the Prophet, to ſhew why he appeared in ſuch ſtian'd Apparel, I have <hi>trodden the Wine-preſs,</hi> &amp;c. Namely, becauſe this in time he would certainly do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="557" facs="tcp:42788:285"/>Ver. 4. <hi>For the day of veng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce is in mine Heart,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, 1. That day fore appointed for taking vengeance is in my Mind, and that it is now come; and, 2. I am heartily deſirous to have it Executed upon them; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.8. <hi>And the year of my Redeemed is come;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 61.2.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And I locked, and there was none to help,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, neither of his own Poeple, nor others; <hi>and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation unto me,</hi> &amp;c. But for all this, ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 69.16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And I will tread down,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, as Grapes are trodden in the Wine-Fat, <hi>the People in mine Anger;</hi> that is, the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and all other my Churches Enemies, <hi>and make them drunk in my fury;</hi> that is, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate them, ſo that they ſhall be like Men ſtupid or mad, no way able to reſiſt me, nor to know which way to turn themſelves. Or the meaning may be, that God would puniſh them with greateſt ſeverity, and out of the Cup of his fury give them their Bellies full of miſery; or, that he would fill them with their own Blood, as with new Wine. But however the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of making them Drunk, ſeems to be here uſed with reſpect to that which he had ſaid before of treading out Wine; ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.9. and 51.17, 20, 21. <hi>And I will bring down their Strength to the Earth;</hi> that is, and thus thoſe ſtrong and mighty Nations ſhall like ſo many drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Men fall to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſes of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins a Prayer of the Prophets, either in his own Name, or rather in the Name of Gods Church, which is continued unto the end of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And herein, in the firſt place he begins with a large and thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Gods wonderful goodneſs to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> in forr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord;</hi> (which laſt is added, becauſe the very mention of the great things that God hath done for his People tends much to his praiſe) <hi>according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us,</hi> &amp;c. where the loving kindneſs of God to them is ſet forth in many Words, not only thereby the more to aggravate their Rebellions againſt God, (of which he ſpeaks afterward) but alſo by way of pleading with God, that ſince he had been ſo gracious to his People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he would be ſo ſtill; and withal to ſtrengthen their faith concerning the deliverance he had now promiſed them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>For he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, God; to wit, when he firſt entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a covenant of Grace with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and took them to be his peculiar People, and Children, he thought and ſaid within himſelf then, as followeth, <hi>ſurely they are my People, Children that will not lie;</hi> that is, that will not be other than what they profeſs themſelves to be, that will not deal faſly and diſloyally with me, but will be ſincerely what they have promiſed and covenanted to be; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 59.13. Indeed it proved otherwiſe: God complain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.20. that they were <hi>Children in whom was no faith;</hi> and our Prophet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.9. that they were <hi>lying Children;</hi> for which ſee the Notes there. But God ſpeaks here (after the manner of Men) as a Father ſhould ſpeak of a Son, to whom he had ſhewn great reſpect, and upon
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:42788:286"/>
whom he had beſtowed great coſt, and of whom therefore he was willing to hope well; much as the Lord ſpake in the parable of the Vineyard, let out to Husbandmen: Surely <hi>they will reverence my Son, Math,</hi> 21.37. <hi>So he was their Saviour;</hi> that is, upon theſe conditions, grounds, and hopes, he undertook the ſafeguarding and preſervation of them. And all this ſets forth the great goodneſs of God to his <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them,</hi> &amp;c.] Some underſtand this of ſome created Angel, imployed by God to ſave and deliver his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in any danger, and that he is called <hi>the Angel of his preſence;</hi> becauſe the Angels do indeed ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in Gods preſence, and behold his Face, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. and being ſent from God, he was in Gods ſtead amongſt them. But I rather think it is meant of Chriſt, the Angel of whom God ſpake to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 23.20, 21. (for which ſee the Notes there) who was always in the boſom of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.18. and is now always before God, interceding for us; <hi>in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;</hi> to wit, out of their bondage in <hi>Egypt; and he bare them and carried them all the days of old;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.11. and 46.3, 4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.] See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>therefore he was turned to be their enemy;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 13.24.19.11. <hi>and he fought againſt them;</hi> to wit, by many adverſaries which he had ſtirred againſt them, in the days of their Judges and Kings. But this is alledged, ſtill to make way for the farther ſetting forth of Gods goodneſs to his People, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe provocations, and thereby to encourage them ſtill to hope in ſo gracious a God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Then he remembred the days of old,</hi> Moſes <hi>and his People,</hi> &amp;c.] Some of our beſt Expoſitors underſtand this as ſpoken of the People of God; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively taken, and therefore they ſay it is expreſſed in the ſingular number. <hi>Then he remembred,</hi> &amp;c. And then again of theſe, ſome underſtand it of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in former times, that when God <hi>fought againſt them,</hi> as it is ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, then <hi>Iſrael</hi> called to mind what God had done for their Fathers, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the People in his days, which is much the ſame with that which is ſaid of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35. But then others underſtand it of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> to wit, that they remembred the great things that God had done for their Anceſtors, when <hi>Moſes</hi> carried them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan.</hi> And accordingly both the one and the other do underſtand the following Words, <hi>where is he that brought them up out of the Sea;</hi> &amp;c? As the Words of the People uttered by way of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bemoaning themſelves, that God did not at preſent do for them, as he had done for their Fathers, and as it were ſighing after the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. But methinks it ſounds very harſh to ſay, that having ſpoken in the foregoing Verſe of the People in the Plural Number, <hi>But they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled—therefore he was turned to be their Enemie, and he fought againſt them;</hi> immediately in the next Words, the Prophet ſhould go on, and ſpeak of them in the Singular Number, <hi>Then he remembred the days of old,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I rather judge, with others, that this is ſpoken of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:42788:286"/>
(and ſo indeed it hath a clear connexion with the laſt Words of the foregoing Verſe, <hi>therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and he fought againſt them. Then he remembred the days of old;</hi>) to wit, that when God ſmote the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in former times, yet calling to mind what he had formerly done for his People, notwithſtanding the frequent and great provocations, wherewith they had provoked him, he thereby induced himſelf to work new deliverances for them. <hi>Then he remembred the days of old,</hi> Moſes <hi>and his People;</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> is mentioned, either, as ſome, to imply Gods remembring the Covenant he had made with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the Mediation of <hi>Moſes;</hi> or, as others, the frequent and vehement Interceſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> on their behalf; or elſe rather only to imply his remembring of his People in the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what he did for them then by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Minſtry. And accordingly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the following Words are alſo to be taken as the Words of God, ſpeaking of himſeif in the third perſon, and that as by way of arguing with himſelf, that ſeeing he had in the days of <hi>Moſes</hi> done ſo much for his People, whom he then took to be his peculiar People, why he ſhould then be found wanting to them, and not afford them the like deliverance again? And indeed by our Tranſlators inſerting the word <hi>(ſaying)</hi> it is evident that they underſtood it thus, <hi>Then he remembred the days of old,</hi> Moſes <hi>and his People, ſaying, where is he that brought them up out of the Sea, with the Shepherd of his Flock?</hi> to wit, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Shepherd of Gods Flock; or, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> if you read it, as it is in the Margin, with <hi>the Shepherds</hi> of his Flock; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.20. <hi>where is he that put his holy Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him?</hi> that is, ſay ſome, the Spirit of Prophecy; or rather thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt gifts of Gods Spirit, whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> was enabled to teach and govern the People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>That led them by the right hand of</hi> Moſes, <hi>with his glorious arm,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Gods Almighty power enabling <hi>Moſes</hi> to do what he did. It was not <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which ſome think is implyed by naming his <hi>right hand)</hi> but God that did it; <hi>dividing the Water before them;</hi> to wit, the Waters, both of the Red Sea and <hi>Jordan; to make himſelf an everlaſting name;</hi> to wit, by the diſcovery, both of his Almighty Power in a work of ſuch wonder, and of his tender care over his People. Some think the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet adds this, by way of farther enlarging that which God had ſaid in the foregoing Verſe; <hi>where is he that brought them up out of the Sea?</hi> &amp;c. But I ſee not why they may not be a continuance of Gods words.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>That led them through the deep, as an Horſe in the Wilderneſs, that they ſhould not ſtumble?</hi> That is, ſoftly and gently, as when a Horſe is led with a Bridle; they did not flee through, as men frighted with fear, but marched over ſoberly and leaſurely; or eaſily, and ſafely, without any danger or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as a Horſe may be led in a Wilderneſs, where the ground is dry, and there is nothing to hinder, or trouble him in his way; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>As a Beaſt goeth down into the Valley, the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Some Expoſitors hold, that here (which is more probable than that which is noted before to be the opinion of others, concerning <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) the Prophet
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:42788:287"/>
doth here ſpeak again, owning, and farther ſetting forth what God had ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, concerning his leading the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through the red Sea, as a Horſe in the Wilderneſs (And indeed the laſt words of this Verſe, <hi>So didſt thou lead thy People,</hi> &amp;c. are clearly the words of the Prophet, or Church to God) <hi>As a Beaſt goeth down into the Valley;</hi> to wit, gently and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it is led down a ſteep Hill; <hi>the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> that is, God by his Almighty Power, or by his Holy Spirit, <hi>cauſed him;</hi> that is, <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay ſome, the Leader of his People, or rather, thy People <hi>Iſrael, to reſt;</hi> to wit, in that the Lord, after he had carried his <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Red Sea, did lead him along quietly through the Wilderneſs, providing for him reſting places by the way (as it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.33.) until he had brought them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of their reſt; ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.11. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.2. And then in the next words, the Prophet turns his ſpeech to God; <hi>ſo didſt thou lead thy People to make thy ſelf a glorious name;</hi> ſee the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Look down from Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the People of God in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the Prophet in their name, having from <hi>ver.</hi> 7. ſet forth what great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy God had ſhown to their Fathers, and what great deliverance he had wrought for them in former times, do now pray, that God would do the like for them; that though he had of late for a time hidden himſelf from them, yet now he would again appear for them; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.14. <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from the habitation of thy Holineſs, and of thy Glory;</hi> to wit, the extream miſery we are in; implying, that if God would but take notice of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, they hoped he could not but pity and help them; <hi>where is thy zeal;</hi> that is, thy vehement love to thy People, not enduring to ſee them wronged by their Enemies; ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.31. <hi>thy ſtrength, the ſounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards me?</hi> (It is an expreſſion taken from thoſe rumblings in the Bowels, which ſtrong paſſions of this nature, do uſually work in Men; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.11.) ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 77.7, and 89.49. <hi>are they reſtrained?</hi> that is, doſt thou, or canſt thou, againſt thy natural inclination, reſtrain thoſe yearnings of thy Bowels, which are wont ſo freely to flow out to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards thy People at other times?</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurly thou wilt pity us thy Children; <hi>though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledge us not;</hi> to wit, as being long ſince departed out of this world: They indeed were our Fathers, but they are now ſtrangers to the things that are done here below, and know nothing of our condition. Some there are indeed, that would have the words underſtood in another ſenſe: As, 1. <hi>Though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us,</hi> &amp;c. that is, though <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not own us, as their Children; yet we are ſure thou, O God, art our Father: Or, 2. Though we ſhould ſuppoſe that they are ignorant of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, let that be granted; yet certainly God is our Father: Or, 3. Though they were not comparatively to be owned as their Fathers; yet to be ſure God was their Father. But all this needs not; there is no cauſe why we ſhould ſtumble at that ſenſe which the words do clearly and plainly hold forth; <hi>thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer;</hi> to wit; therefore their Father, becauſe
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:42788:287"/>
he was their Redeemer; <hi>thy name is from everlaſting;</hi> that is, thy fame for thy great works hath been from everlaſting; or this thy name of being the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of thy People hath been from everlaſting. And indeed, thus ſome read the laſt words jointly together, as it is in the Margin; <hi>our Redeemer from everlaſting is thy name:</hi> It may be haply queſtioned by ſome, why, in the beginning of this Verſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> is not reckoned amongſt their Fathers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But to this, the common anſwer that is given is, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, becauſe God did ofteneſt and moſt ſolemnly appear to them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Covenant with them; and becauſe the Covenant was firſt made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all <hi>Jacobs</hi> Children were taken into Covenant. And beſides it is ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> being named, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that was between them, is included.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to err from thy ways?</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken with reference to that before: <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Why haſt thou made us to err from thy ways? and hardened our Heart from thy fear?</hi> That is, Why haſt thou, by way of puniſhing us for our ſins, withdrawn thy Spirit from us, and delivered us up to a Spirit of error and obſtinacy, and ſo left us to run after our own Hearts into ſo many erroeous and wicked ways? ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.9, 10. and 29.10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.13. and <hi>Job</hi> 12.16. Some indeed underſtand this a little otherwiſe: Namely, that this is ſpoken of Gods being the occaſion of their turning away from Gods ways, and their obſtinacy therein, by continuing them ſo long under the oppreſſion of their cruel Enemies; which is indeed a ſore temptation; for which ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. But I conceive the firſt Expoſition is the beſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that it is ſpoken by way of bewailing, that their Heavenly Father ſhould in ſuch wrath withdraw himſelf from them, and ſo leave them under ſuch a dreadful Judgment, and by way of entreating that it might be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with them; as if they had ſaid, Why doſt thou not ſoften our Hearts, and reform what is amiſs in us? <hi>Return for thy Servants ſake, the tribes of thine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;</hi> that is, be reconciled again to thy People, and ſhew thy ſelf again fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, becauſe they are thy Servants, and thine Inheritance; and it might ſeem diſhonourable to God, to caſt off his Servants, or to diſregard his own Inheritance. Yet ſome underſtand it otherwiſe; <hi>Return for thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſake,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, with reſpect to thy Servants, our Progenitors, and with reſpect to the Covenant which thou madeſt with them; ſee Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.1. But the former Expoſition is far the clearer.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>The People of thine Holineſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, thy holy People; ſee the Note, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. <hi>have poſſeſſed it but a little while;</hi> and this they ſay, though they had poſſeſſed it many hundred years, becauſe Men are prone to think it but a little time when they have enjoyed a thing long, if they earneſtly deſire to enjoy it longer; or rather becauſe thoſe many hundred years were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but <hi>a little while,</hi> in compariſon of what God had promiſed the Patriarchs: Namely, that they ſhould poſſeſs it for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Our Enemies have trodden down thy Sanctuary;</hi> that is, thy Temple, or the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo called Gods Sanctury; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.54. However this implies, that the wrong to himſelf might well engage the Lord to appear againſt their Enemies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>OH that thou wouldeſt rent the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c.] The People of God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much troubled at that whereof they had complained in the latter end of the foregoing Chapter, that the Heathens had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Land, which God had given them, and had profaned and trodden down Gods Sanctuary, do here beg of God (going on in the Prayer begun <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of that Chapter) that breaking through all impediments, he would ſuddenly, and in great fury and indignation, come down and deſtroy the Enemies of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and deliver his People out of their hands: <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt rent the Heavens, that thou wouldeſt come down;</hi> that is, that thou wouldeſt come down, rending the Heavens all aſunder before thee; <hi>that the Mountains might flow down at thy preſence;</hi> that is, might be melted, and ſo flow away like Water, or melted Wax; where by melting the Mountains may be figuratively meant the deſtroying and overturning the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and other the proud and lofty Enemies of his People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the removing of all impediments out of the way of their return home to their own Country; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.5. Or elſe it may be ſpoken by way of alluſion to that which was done, at the giving of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where all being on a light flame, in that terrible tempeſt of Thunder and Lightning, the Mountains ſeemed to tremble and melt away; ſee the Note, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.4. and ſo the deſire of Gods People here may be, that in delivering them now he would ſhew forth ſome ſuch ſign of his Glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Power, as he did at the giving of the Law. Some, I know, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this concerning Gods rending the Heavens and coming down, of the Incarnation of the Son of God; and accordingly by the flowing down of the Mountains, they underſtand either the humbling of the Hearts of proud Sinners by the preaching of the Goſpel, or elſe the deſtroying of all the Enemies of his People. But if the firſt coming of Chriſt be here intended, it is but only as his Redemption was typified by the deliverance of Gods People out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>As when the melting Fire burneth,</hi> &amp;c.] This hath reference to the laſt words of the foregoing Verſe, where Gods People deſired, that at Gods appearing for them; <hi>the Mountains might flow down</hi> (and there may be ſtill an alluſion to Gods cauſing the Mountains of <hi>Sinai</hi> to melt away, as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) namely, that this might be done; <hi>As when a melting Fire,</hi> which uſeth to be moſt vehement, <hi>burneth;</hi> to wit, the Wood and Coles which are the Fuel of it, or burneth or melteth Mettals by the heat of it, and as when <hi>the Fire cauſeth the Waters hanged over it to boile; to make thy Name known to thine Adverſaries;</hi> See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 63.12.) <hi>That the Nations may tremble at thy Preſence;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and other Enemies. And hereby now
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:42788:288"/>
is ſhewn what was meant in the foregoing Verſe by the flowing down of the Mountains at Gods Preſence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>When thou didſt terrible things which we looked not for,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, which our forefathers did never expect thou wouldeſt have done for them, as being things that ſeemed, when done, above all credit and belief, and ſuch as humane reaſon could not comprehend, <hi>thou cameſt down, the Mountain flowed down at thy Preſence;</hi> as if they had ſaid, Thou didſt then for them that which we at preſent deſire of thee. And now by theſe <hi>terrible things</hi> done formerly for their Progenitors are doubtleſs meant all thoſe ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious miraculous Works, which God wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> from the time that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to fetch them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> until they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and amongſt the reſt more eſpecially thoſe things which were done at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for which ſee the Note before; <hi>ver.</hi> 1. And the drift of this is to imply, that ſince God had done ſuch great things for them formerly, they might hope that he would now do the like again for them, when they begged it of him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For ſince the beginning of the World Men have not heard, nor perceived by the Eare, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him that waiteth for him.</hi>) That is, None, beſides thee, O God, who didſt intend and determine before-hand to do them, did ever hear or ſee, or was able to reach or comprehend thoſe wonderful things, which thou haſt prepared for them that truſting in thee, do patiently depend and waite upon thee; Or elſe (according to the Tranſlation, that is in the Margin of our Bibles) there was never humane Ear or Eye, that ever did hear or ſee any God beſides thee, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that hath done or prepared to do ſuch things, as thou haſt prepared for thy People. And this is alſo added to ſhew, that they might well be incouraged to beg that which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, of a God that had formerly done ſuch unheard of, ſuch unſeen and wonderful things for his People. Now by theſe wonderful things which from the beginning of the World Men had never heard nor ſeen, are meant, I conceive, thoſe terrible things which they looked not for, mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, which God had done for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in his carrying them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> for which ſee the Note there; and this may ſeem the more probable, becauſe that which the Prophet ſaith here doth ſo fully agree with that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had long ſince ſaid concerning thoſe wonderful works which God did then for the <hi>Iſraelites; Deut.</hi> 4.32, 33, 34. <hi>For ask now of the days that are paſt, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created Man upon the Earth; and ask from the one ſide of Heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing, as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it,</hi> &amp;c.] The Apoſtle indeed makes uſe of theſe words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Where ſpeaking of the wiſdom revealed in the Goſpel, he affirms it to be above the reach of Mans underſtanding: <hi>Which none,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the Princes of this world knew—But as it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor Eare heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man.</hi> (Which Clauſe is added by the Apoſtle, the better to explain the words of the Prophet) <hi>the things which God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> And by theſe things
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:42788:289"/>
ſome underſtand the incomprehenſible happineſs, which God hath prepared in Heaven for his Poople; but moſt, of the Myſteries revealed in the Goſpel, which had been formerly hidden even from Gods own People. But it is uſual with the Pen-men of the New Teſtament to alledge paſſages out of the Old, only by way of alluſion; See the like noted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.4. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the words here are ſo general, that they may well comprehend all the incomprehenſible Works of God for his People, though they might be more particularly intended, as is before ſaid, of the Wonders formerly wrought in the Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoiceth, and worketh righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Thoſe that truſting in thee do rejoice in thee, and do their Duty; Or, thoſe that do joyfully and chearfully obey thee, and delight to do that which is right in thine Eyes: And by meeting them, I conceive is meant meeting them in a way of Love, Mercy, and Reconciliation; as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals Father went out to meet him, whilſt he was yet afar off; <hi>Luke</hi> 15.30. and as in our ordinary Speech we are wont to ſay of thoſe, to whom we are willing to be reconciled; <hi>that we will at any time meet them half way: Thoſe that remember thee in thy ways;</hi> that is, that remember thee in thy ſeveral wayes, or diſpenſations of thy Providence, whether of Mercy or Judgment, do accordingly praiſe thee, or pray unto thee; Or rather, thoſe that being mindful of thee, and ſo of their Duty to thee are careful to walk in the wayes thou haſt enjoyned them. But now the queſtion will be of whom this is ſpoken. Some think it is meant of Gods dealing in former times with their forefathers; <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoiceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes;</hi> that is, thou didſt meet, or wert wont to meet them in great loving kindneſs and Mercy, thou didſt ſhew them great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour many and many times: as if they had ſaid, Thus it was with our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; but it is far otherwiſe now with us. But according to our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I conceive it is ſpoken indefinitely, as of that which God doth at all times; and ſo it may imply both, that God had done ſo with his righteous Servants in former Ages, and that he would have done the like alſo for them, if they had trodden in the ſteps of their holy Progenitors; <hi>behold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned;</hi> as if they had ſaid, becauſe we have ſinned, thou haſt in thy wrath brought great Miſeries upon us, and ſo it was with us, as it was with our Fathers; <hi>in thoſe is continuance, and we ſhall be ſaved;</hi> that is, in thoſe thy ways of Goodneſs and Mercy to thy People there is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, they are ſtable and perpetual: And therefore we hope that we ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as any Perſon, or Thing, Naturally, or Legally unclean: As namely, Lepers, and ſuch as had touched any dead body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were doubtleſs ſome holy Perſons amongſt them, even when they were in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But they ſpeak here of the body of the People in general, that were wicked and prophane, and caſt out of the Holy Land, and excluded from all Communion with God in his Sanctuary; even as thoſe that were legally unclean, were ſhut up for a time from conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with their Brethren, and from going into the Temple. And this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:42788:289"/>
added, as in oppoſition to that which was ſaid in the foregoing Verſe; either thus, Thou wert very gracious to our Fore-fathers, that rejoyced and wrought Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now they are all gone, and we are <hi>all as an unclean thing,</hi> &amp;c. Or thus, Thou art conſtantly gracious to thoſe that work Righteouſneſs, and remember thee in thy ways; yea, and when thou art wroth with them, becauſe they have ſinned againſt thee, upon their returning to thee, thou, out of thy unchangeable goodneſs and mercy, art ready to ſhew them Mercy, and to ſave them; but alas, it is not thus with us; <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags;</hi> and for this laſt branch, there is much difference amongſt Expoſitors concerning this word <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> 1. Some think the abſtract is here put for the concrete, as if they had ſaid, Our moſt Righteous men are as filthy Rags. 2. Others underſtand it as ſpoken Ironically of thoſe horrid Enormities, wherewith they had provoked God to caſt them out of the Land; and for this ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 57.12. 3. Others hold, that thereby is meant all their Legal Rights and Services, which being performed Hypocritically, and by men profane and wicked, were abominable in Gods ſight, how Righteous ſoever they judged themſelves in that regard. And, 4. Many conceive that hereby is meant, that the beſt actions of the beſt of them, when beſt performed, had ſo much defilement of Corruption and Sin cleaving to them, as might render them, if God ſhould examine them rigorouſly by the rule of his Law, hateful unto him. And indeed either of theſe four Expoſitions do fairly ſuit with the drift of this place. And then for the following words, they contain an acknowledgment of the miſery, whereinto their Sins had brought them; <hi>and we all do fade away as a leaf;</hi> that is, the Beauty and Glory of our former eſtate is withered and gone; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.6, 7. <hi>and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away;</hi> that is, as the Wind drives faded leaves from off the Tree, or blows them about, when they are fallen from the Tree, ſo have our Sins driven us away into the Land of our Captivity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And there is none that calleth on thy name,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, though we are in ſo ſad a condition, yet there are very few, none in a manner, that for the appeaſing of thy wrath, and the removal of theſe Judgments, doth in a right manner, ſeriouſly, and from their Hearts cry unto thee; (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.22.) for that this is meant by calling on Gods Name, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the following words; <hi>that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on thee;</hi> that is, that do endeavour to rouſe up themſelves, that they may with all poſſible fervency and importunity pray unto thee, that ſo thereby they may keep thee from departing away from them, or win thee to return again in mercy to them, or ſtay thy hand from ſmiting them any farther; as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, as it were, hold the hand of God from deſtroying the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he ſaid unto <hi>Moſes; Let me alone that I may deſtroy them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.14. Or, that they might cleave cloſe to God, as their God and Father, reſting upon his Grace and faithfulneſs, though in his anger he ſeemed reſolved to caſt them off. The ſum of what they here confeſs againſt themſelves is, That there was ſcarce any amongſt them, that took care to ſtep in and intercede for the People, as <hi>Moſes, Samuel,</hi> and others in former Ages had done; As for the laſt clauſe;
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:42788:290"/>
                  <hi>for thou haſt hid thy face from us</hi> (ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap</hi> 8.17. and 57.17.) that may be added as a reaſon, not only of the miſeries that were come upon them, but alſo of their ſtupidity, in that they called not upon God, when they were in ſuch miſery. It was becauſe for their wickedneſs God had hid his face from them, and left them to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the Clay, and thou our Potter, and we all are the work of thine hand.]</hi> To wit, not only as we are thy Creatures, but alſo as we are thy People; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.25. and 43.1, 21. and <hi>Job</hi> 10.8, 9. In the words the People of God ſeem to plead with him, that though he might at his pleaſure break them in pieces, as the Potter may his Pots, yet that he would rather ſpare them and deal favourably with them, both out of reſpect to the frailty of their condition; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. and eſpecially, becauſe of the intereſt he had in them, as being his Children and the work of his hands; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.73.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Be not wrath very ſore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever,</hi> &amp;c.] As if they had ſaid, Though this we have deſerved, yet deal more favourably with us; ſee the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>behold, ſee we beſeech thee;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 63.15. <hi>we are all thy People;</hi> that is, thou haſt taken us to be thy Covenant People; and therefore ſpare us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Thy holy Cities are a wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the Cities of <hi>Judea,</hi> which are called <hi>holy Cities,</hi> as the whole Country is called <hi>the holy Land, Zach.</hi> 2.12. becauſe of the ſpecial intereſt which God had in them, as having given them for an habitation to his holy People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherein they were to ſerve and Worſhip God, as they did conſtantly in their Synagogues every Sabbath, both in Prayer, and hearing the word Preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. Some indeed hold, that the following words, Zion <hi>is a Wilderneſs,</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a Deſolation,</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew what were the <hi>holy Cities</hi> they intended; to wit, <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where the Temple was, wherein God was eſpecially ſerved; and which were ſometimes ſpoken of, as two diſtinct Cities, <hi>Zion</hi> being more peculiarly called the City of <hi>David.</hi> However by mentioning the deſolation of theſe Cities, they ſeek to move God to pity them, and to deſtroy their Enemies; though not for their ſakes, that had deſerved ſo ill at his hands, yet with reſpect to his own Glory, and to his own Concernments.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Our holy and our beautiful houſe, where our Fathers praiſed thee, is burnt with Fire,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added as a farther aggravation of their miſery, that not only their Cities, even <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> amongſt the reſt, but even the Temple alſo was burnt with Fire, that goodly houſe which God had given them to be the peculiar place for his Worſhip and Service, and which was far dearer to them than their own private Houſes. But now withall there are two things hinted, very obſervable, in that Clauſe; <hi>where our Fathers praiſed thee:</hi> as namely, 1. That being as it were aſhamed to alledge their own ſerving of God there, becauſe they had been ſo regardleſs of their duty therein, and had done what they did in ſuch a manner, as might well render it loathſome to God; yet they put him in mind how formerly in better times their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had duly ſerved him there: And, 2. How ſad a thing it was, that they ſhould now weep and lament over the ruines of that Houſe, wherein their
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:42788:290"/>
Anceſtors with ſuch triumphant joy uſed to praiſe God for his goodneſs to them; <hi>and all our pleaſant things are laid waſte;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, all the choice things, wherein we took pleaſure, are ſpoiled and carried away. But the word, <hi>laid waſte,</hi> doth rather import, that they ſpeak hear of their goodly Palaces and great Houſes, publick and private, which were likewiſe by the Enemy burnt down and deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Wilt thou refrain thy ſelf for theſe things, O Lord?</hi> &amp;c.] That is, Canſt thou contain thy ſelf from coming in to our help, and from avenging thy ſelf upon our Enemies, when thou ſeeſt us, thy People, in ſuch a miſerable condition, and our Enemies offering ſo much wrong to thy ſelf, and thy Concernments? Though we have deſerved to be puniſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; yet wilt thou not vindicate thine own glory?</p>

                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 1. <hi>I Am ſought of them that asked not for me,</hi> &amp;c.] Many Expoſitors take this to be Gods Anſwer to the Prayer of his People in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein by his ſeeking out thoſe that minded not him, he aſſures them, that he would have been ready enough to have hearkened to the Prayers of his People, had they called upon him in a right manner, and had they not by their obſtinate wickedneſs cauſed him to diſregard their Prayers. But now others, not improbably, ſay, that the main ſcope of this place, is to foretell the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the juſt cauſe God had ſo to deal with them. Only leſt they ſhould hence infer the making void of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God had made with their Fathers, he firſt promiſeth this concerning the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in whom the Covenant ſhould be made good, they being by Faith ingratifted into the Stock of <hi>Iſrael; I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not;</hi> that is, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that in former times did neither know me, nor inquire nor ſeek after me, do now upon the Preaching of the Goſpel to them (won thereto by my preventing Grace) both ſeek after me, and find me, and worſhip me; for that it is the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is evident, becauſe it is by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly applyed thereto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20. <hi>But</hi> Eſaias <hi>is very bold</hi> (to wit, in that he durſt tell the <hi>Jews</hi> of that which was ſo hateful to them, the taking in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their ſtead to be the People of God) <hi>and ſaith, I was found of them that ſought me not, I was made manifeſt unto them, that asked not after me.</hi> They are the very ſame words in effect with thoſe of the Prophet here, only the two branches are tranſpoſed. As for the following Words here added by the Prophet, they are to the ſame purpoſe with that which went before; <hi>I ſaid, behold

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>all the day;</hi> that is, for a long time together, conſtantly and continually, even in a long Succeſſion of Ages, firſt by my Prophets, and afterward by my Son, <hi>unto a Rebellious People;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Jews;</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle expounds it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>But to Iſrael he ſaith, all day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gainſaying People,</hi> which is here in the Prophet, <hi>which walketh in a way that was not good;</hi> that is, in ways very bad, wicked waies; ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>after their own thoughts;</hi> that is, as ſeems good in their own Eyes, according to the inclination and deſires of their own naughty Hearts: And herein it is like their following their own devices in their manifold Will-worſhips, may be principally intended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that which follows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>A People that provoketh me to anger continually to my Face,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, by their Superſtitions and Idolatries, ſay ſome, which they had brought into the very Temple, the place of Gods ſpecial preſence: Or, 2. by doing boldly and impudently that which was contrary to what God in his Word had expreſly enjoyned them; or, 3. by ſinning openly and confidently, not in the leaſt fearing Gods allſeeing Eye; <hi>that Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in Gardens;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.29. <hi>and burneth Incenſe upon Bricks,</hi> (ſo it is in the Hebrew) that is, <hi>upon Altars of Bricks,</hi> as the Word is rendered in our Tranſlation, of which happily they choſe to build their Altars, that they might be the more curiouſly Hewed and Carved. But yet, as in a way of contempt (with reſpect to their leaving his Golden Altar, to burn incenſe upon them) God calls them barely <hi>Bricks.</hi> I know there are ſome that do otherwiſe underſtand this laſt clauſe; namely, that it is meant of the Bricks or Tiles wherewith their flat-roofed Houſes were covered, where indeed theſe Idolaters uſed to burn Incenſe to their Idols; or at leaſt of the Altars of Brick, which for that purpoſe they were wont to build there; ſee the Note, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Which remain among the Graves, and lodge in the Monuments,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, That haunted places where the dead had been buried, and ſometimes continued there a long while together, even lodging there by Night, perhaps for the greater ſecreſie; to wit, that they might raiſe up their Ghoſts, and conſult with them, or receive Anſwers from them in their ſleep, by Revelations and Divinatory Dreams: Or, that they might Conſult with evil Spirits, that uſually delight to appear to Men in ſuch doleful ſolitary places; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.19. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Which eat Swines fleſh,</hi> expreſly againſt the Law of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.11. <hi>and

Or rather, theſe are a vexation, a trouble, and offence to me, as ſmoke uſeth to be to Mens Eyes and Noſes; <hi>a Fire that burneth all the day;</hi> that is, they cauſe mine anger to burn like Fire againſt them continually, or even unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and to burn them like ſo much combuſtible matter, with a Fire, ſay ſome, that ſhall never be quenched.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Behold, it is written before me,</hi> &amp;c.] Some refer this to that which follows, concerning Gods puniſhing them, and ſo would have the meaning to be, that God had determined and decreed, that he would be avenged on them for their wickedneſs; See the Note, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.26. But it is rather meant of their Evil ways before mentioned; to wit, that they were kept upon Record before God, and were ever in his Eye: <hi>I will not keep ſilence;</hi> that is, I will forbear them no longer; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.14. <hi>but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, even recompence into their Boſome;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, by ſtriking them with ſuch terrors of Conſcience, that they ſhall feel what it is to ſin againſt me: Or rather, it is meant of puniſhing them abundantly; the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being taken from thoſe that when they would give of any thing plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to others, are wont to pour it into their Laps, not ſtanding to court or meaſure what they give; See the Note, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7 <hi>Your Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c.] This depends upon the foregoing Verſe: What would he recompence into their Boſomes? Why, <hi>your Iniquities, and the Iniquities of your Fathers together (ſaith the Lord God)</hi> to wit, by puniſhing you both for the one and the other. But how can it ſtand with the Juſtice of God, to puniſh Children for the Sins of their Parents? I anſwer, 1. That God never puniſheth any particular Perſons for the ſins of their Parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they run on in ways of wickedneſs, as their Parents did before them. 2. That he never brings any evil upon any wicked perſons, but what their own Sins have abundantly deſerved. 3. That yet it is no impeachment to the Juſtice of God, to puniſh wicked Men the more ſeverely and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, even with reſpect to the wickedneſs of their Parents, that haply eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their time, that ſo it may be obſerved, that vengeance, though delayed
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:42788:292"/>
for a time, doth uſually at length fall upon the Race of the Wicked. And 4. that in cutting off a Nation, when they have filled up the meaſure of their Iniquities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. it is no injuſtice in God, thereby to puniſh the ſins both of that preſent Age, and of former Generations; <hi>which,</hi> that is, which Fathers of yours, <hi>have burnt Incenſe upon the Mountains, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed me upon the Hills;</hi> to wit, by theſe their Idolatrous Courſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord was indeed really <hi>Blaſphemed,</hi> 1. By that baſe contempt which they caſt upon him, in that they ſlighted him, and his Law, and minded not what was there enjoined them. 2. In that they gave away the Glory due to him, to ſuch baſe Idols. And 3. By forſaking him, to follow the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol Gods of the Heathens: <hi>Therefore will I meaſure their former work into their Boſome;</hi> that is, <hi>I</hi> will puniſh them for their ſins long ſince committed, yea even by their Fathers.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] Here a Promiſe of mercy is added, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaving of a Remnant in that common Deſtruction that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Jews: As the new Wine is found in the Cluſter, and one ſaith, Deſtroy it not;</hi> that is, As when a Man is going about to cut down a blaſted or barren Vine, and one eſpying ſome one good Cluſter of Grapes on ſome Bough of it, doth call upon him to ſpare it; <hi>Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing is in it;</hi> that is, Deſtroy not this Bunch, for there is ſome good Wine, ſome juice and liquor in it, through the Bleſſing of God upon it; or, deſtroy not this Vine, for by this Cluſter it appears, that there is ſtill a Bleſſing, life and ſap in it, and there may be hope therefore, that by good Husbandry and Pruning away the dead Branches, it may recover and bear good Fruit again; and thereupon he forbears to cut down the Vine: <hi>ſo will I do for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſakes, that I may not deſtroy them all;</hi> ſo will I do with my People, for the ſake of thoſe righteous ſincere Servants of mine that are amongſt them, I will not deſtroy the whole Nation, but reſerve a Remnant to be a ſtock for after-times.</p>

But now under this, the plenty of Spiritual Bleſſings in the Days of the Goſpel may alſo be implyed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>But ye are they that forſake the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4.28. <hi>that forget my Holy Mountain;</hi> that is, that mind not my Holy Temple or Mount <hi>Zion; that prepare a Table for that troop,</hi> or for <hi>Gad,</hi> as it is in the Margin of our Bibles, according to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Some take this, and that alſo which follows of <hi>Meni,</hi> to be the proper Names of two Idols. And again others think, that by <hi>Gad</hi> (rendered in our Tranſlation <hi>that troop</hi>) is meant either the Planet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> or that imaginary Deity of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which certainly the Heathens Worſhipped as a Goddeſs; <hi>Sed te, Nos facimus fortuna deam, coeloque locamus;</hi> and they tell us great Stories of Tables which they uſed to prepare for this Idol, furniſhed with all kind of Proviſion. But far more probably <hi>I</hi> conceive others hold, that by <hi>that troop</hi> is meant the Hoſt of Heaven, or the numberleſs Multitude of the Stars they Worſhipped; or rather the huge Multitude of their Idol-Gods, which they daily encreaſed, as if they thought they could never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of them. And accordingly ſome think, that by thoſe words, <hi>they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Table for that troop;</hi> is meant, the preparing of Sacrifices which they laid on the Altars of theſe their Idol-Gods, the rather enclining hereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods Altar is ſometimes called <hi>the Table of the Lord,</hi> as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7, 12. But rather hereby is meant the ſolemn Feaſts which they kept in honour of their Idols, in the places where they Worſhipped their Idols, and of part of the Sacrifices, which they offered to their Idols; ſee the Note, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.27. much after the manner of the ſolemn Feaſts, which Gods People were appointed to keep in the Tabernacle and Temple: And then for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words; <hi>And that furniſh a Drink-Offering to that number;</hi> (where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word <hi>Meni</hi> is again in the Margin) Some do hereby underſtand the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Merchants God, becauſe their buſineſs conſiſts much in numbering and caſting up Accounts: And others again conceive that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is meant the ſeven Planets; or ſome Conſtellation conſiſting of a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Stars. But here again I conceive it moſt probable, that the ſame is meant by <hi>that number,</hi> that was before meant by <hi>that troop;</hi> to wit, the numberleſs number either of the Stars, or rather of their Idol-Gods which they worſhipped. And ſo by furniſhing <hi>a Drink-Offering to that number,</hi> is meant, that they did liberally provide Sacrifices and Drink-Offerings for every one of them, not omitting any, though there were ſuch a huge Multitude of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Therefore will I number you to the Sword,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken with reference to <hi>that number</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe, to which they are there ſaid to have poured forth their Drink-Offerings; as if it had been expreſſed thus; Since you are ſo delighted with Numbers, or ſince you are ſo pleaſed with the numberleſs number of your Gods, and are ſo zealous to worſhip them all, not omitting any one of them; I alſo will deliver
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:42788:293"/>
you up by Multitudes to the Slaughter, or I will deliver you up to be ſlain by Tale and Number, ſo that none of you ſhall eſcape; <hi>and ye ſhall all bow down to the Slaughter;</hi> as if he had ſaid, You that have bowed down to your Idols, ſhall then bow down to be ſlain by your Enemies; <hi>becauſe when I called, ye did not anſwer,</hi> &amp;c. That is, becauſe ye were by my Prophets better inſtructed, and often preſſed to leave your Idolatries, and yet you would obſtinately go on, and would not hearken to them; <hi>but did evil before mine Eyes;</hi> See the Note above, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>and did chuſe that wherein I delighted not;</hi> that is, and did adviſedly chuſe to do that which was an abomination to me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold my Servants ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry,</hi> &amp;c] That is, my Servants that continue faithful to me ſhall live comfortably in the aſſurance of my favour, and be provided for, even to full contentation, of all bleſſings requiſite, both Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: Whereas you that have forſaken me, to run after Idol-Gods, ſhall fall into extremity of Miſery. By the wicked here threatned, I underſtand thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom the Prophet now ſpeaks, who becauſe they had given their Meat and Drink to Idol-Gods, ſhould within a while be carried Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there periſh with hunger and thirſt; and on the other ſide, by the Servants of God, to whom ſo much good is here Promiſed, that faithful Remnant, that ſhould be delivered out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> for this indeed, I conceive, is primarily here intended, as being moſt agreeable with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. But yet ſome extend the Promiſes here made, to that Holy Seed that would riſe up to his Church in the Days of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And ye ſhall leave your Name for a curſe unto my choſen,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, You now Glory in the name of being the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that holy People of God; but alas! hereafter you ſhall find it quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Or, whereas you hope to leave a Name of great renown behind you, inſtead hereof, when you are gone, <hi>ye ſhall leave your Name for a curſe;</hi> So that when men ſhall curſe any body, they ſhall inſtance in you, ſaying, Mayeſt thou be curſed, as the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> were curſed, that were carried Captives to <hi>Babylon;</hi> according to that which is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.22. <hi>And of them ſhall be taken up a curſe by all the Captivity of</hi> Judah <hi>which are in</hi> Babylon, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Lord make thee like</hi> Zedekiah, <hi>and like</hi> Ahab, <hi>whom the King of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon <hi>roſted in the Fire.</hi> But ſee alſo the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.28. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.21. <hi>For the Lord God ſhall ſlay thee,</hi> as was ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>and call his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by another name;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, not <hi>Jews</hi> but Chriſtians. But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think, that hereby is meant either, 1. That he would take other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be his People. Or 2. That Men ſhould not uſe their name in curſing as they did the <hi>Jews,</hi> but rather in bleſſing. Or 3. That they ſhould be brought into a Glorious ſtate and condition; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 62.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>That he who bleſſeth himſelf in the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] This is mentioned as the effect of that bliſs and joy which in the three foregoing verſes God had promiſed his People; to wit, that hereupon it ſhould come to paſs, <hi>That he who bleſſeth himſelf in the Earth, ſhall bleſs himſelf in the God of Truth;</hi> that is, the true God, or the faithful God. Some underſtand this thus, that
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:42788:293"/>
he who judgeth himſelf to be in a bleſſed and happy Eſtate, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himſelf with hope that he is in ſuch an Eſtate, ſhall aſcribe it wholly to God, and to his Promiſes of Grace: But rather the meaning is, that whoſoever ſhall wiſh or pray for any bleſſing upon himſelf, ſhall wiſh it of God, or pray to the true God for it. And though by thoſe words <hi>in the Earth,</hi> may be meant in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſo the intent of the words may be, that after that, in that Land no Man ſhould bleſs himſelf in any other but the true God; yet rather it is meant of the whole Earth in general, as having reſpect to the Days of the Goſpel; to wit, that all the World over Men ſhould only bleſs themſelves in the true God: <hi>And he that ſweareth in the Earth, ſhall ſwear by the God of Truth;</hi> to wit, only, and not by any Idol God; and ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Chap</hi> 19.18. <hi>Becauſe the former troubles are forgotten;</hi> that is, becauſe God ſhall put an end to all his Peoples former troubles, or becauſe he ſhall bring them to ſuch a happy Eſtate, that this ſhall make them forget all their former Miſeries; (ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 54 4.) <hi>and becauſe they are hid from mine Eyes;</hi> to wit, becauſe I ſhall quite take them away, as not being able any longer to ſee my Children in ſuch Miſery. The inference is this, That becauſe they ſhould ſo plainly ſee, that it was God that had made ſuch a bleſſed change in their Eſtate, therefore they ſhould own and Worſhip no other God but him: But yet withal we muſt know, that this which is ſaid of the troubles of his People being forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and hid from Gods Eyes, may be underſtood alſo in a Goſpel-ſenſe, of their being freed from all the Miſeries their Sins had deſerved, partly by a full Pardon of their Sins through Faith in Chriſt here, and compleatly by a perfect Freedom from all evil in Heaven hereafter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>For behold, I create new Heavens and a new Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.16. It is as if he had ſaid, I am about to make ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Change in my Church, that it ſhall ſeem to be as if there were a new World created. This was begun at the Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> A wonderful Change was then made, when thoſe that were a little before in ſuch miſerable Bondage in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were ſetled again in their own Land, and had rebuilt the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and their Temple therein; It might be well then ſaid, that God had then created <hi>new Heavens and a new Earth.</hi> The Heavens were not Cloudy and frowning, as before, but clear and fair; the Earth was not Barren and Deſart, as before, but Fruitful and well Inhabited. But yet more fully this was done in that far more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Change that was wrought in the World, when Chriſt accompliſhed the Work of his Peoples Redemption, and the Goſpel began to be Preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Nations: For then indeed in regard of Doctrine, Ordinances, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Gifts and Graces conferred upon Gods People, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And I will rejoice in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and joy in my People,</hi> &amp;c.] This is added, either as the main cauſe, why Gods People were in the foregoing verſe preſſed to be ſo exceeding joyful, Gods Love and Favour being indeed the main ground of his Peoples joy; or elſe, as a farther illuſtration of the Happineſs promiſed them; to wit, that it ſhould be ſo great, that not only they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, but even God alſo ſhould rejoice for it together with them; <hi>And the voice of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying;</hi> which, as it hath reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were brought home out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt be underſtood comparatively, that there ſhould be no ſuch weeping and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them, as there had been formerly; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.19. and 54.9. and 60.18. But as it is ſpoken with reſpect to the People of God in the Days of the Goſpel, it muſt be meant of the eminent comfort which they ſhould find here even in their greateſt Sorrows and Sufferings; becauſe of the joy they have in Eternal things, which they cannot loſe; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of their compleat Freedom from all Sorrow in Heaven; See the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.8. and 35.10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>There ſhall be no more thence an infant of Days,</hi> &amp;c.] I paſs by many Expoſitions that are given of theſe Words that have indeed no ſhew of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in them. Some indeed there are, which though I conceive they be not intended in this place, yet more is ſaid for them with ſome appearance of truth, than for the other; as, 1. That the Prophet ſpeaks here of the great Change that ſhould be in thoſe happy times here promiſed, in regard of the Wiſdom, and Gravity, and Holineſs that ſhould be found amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; that there ſhould be none amongſt them ſo Fooliſh, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, and Vain, and Boyiſh, as there had been; their old Men ſhould be ſuch, in regard of their prudence and Gravity, as might well be looked upon as Men fully of ripe Age, and ſuch as had every way carried themſelves as became their Years: Nay farther, even <hi>the Child</hi> ſhould carry himſelf as if he were a Man of <hi>an hundred years old;</hi> that is, a Man of great Years; See the Note, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.3. But as for thoſe that being old were yet void of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that lived vainly and ſinfully, like old Boys or Children, they ſhould be looked upon as abominable and <hi>accurſed,</hi> or as ſuch ſhould be cut off by the Hand of God. And indeed thus much may be ſaid for this Expoſition, that Men that are Childiſh and Vain for Underſtanding and Manners, are
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:42788:294"/>
termed Children and Babes in the Scripture; ſee the Note, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16. Or, 2. That this is ſpoken of the Spiritual Eſtate of Gods People in the Days of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, that Believers ſhould not always continue in a ſtate of Infancy in Knowledge and Grace, but that they ſhould be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing up in Grace <hi>unto a perfect Man,</hi> in which Eſtate, without decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſhould continue for ever, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12.16. Or, 3. That this muſt be refered to the Reſurrection, and to the Eternal Eſtate of Gods People in Heaven, wherein there ſhall be no weakneſs of Infancy or Child-hood, nor Infirmities of old Age, but all ſhall be freſh and flouriſhing; Children ſhall be raiſed in a perfect Stature, and Old Men in Youthful ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.

                  <hi>VERSE.</hi> 1. <hi>THus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] As the Prophet in the beginning of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) Expoſtulated with the <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning their carnal confidence in their Temple and Sacrifices, ſo he doth here again toward the cloſe of his Prophecy: <hi>The Heaven is my Throne;</hi> to wit, becauſe there the Majeſty of God is moſt gloriouſly ſet forth: <hi>and the Earth is my Footſtool;</hi> that is, as vaſt a body as the Earth is, it is but a little Foot-ſtool for me; <hi>Where is the Houſe that ye build unto me? And where is the place of my Reſt?</hi> So the Temple was called; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever.</hi> The drift of the whole paſſage, I conceive, is this. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were a wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:42788:295"/>
falſehearted towards God, and wholly regardleſs of obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and yet in the mean ſeaſon gloried much in Gods dwelling amongſt them in his Temple, as if they had thought, that God had been included in thoſe Walls, and thereupon they had no cauſe to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his favour, and his gracious acceptance of the Service that was there done him, or to fear that he would ever forſake them, or this his dwelling place; therefore the Lord doth here from the infiniteneſs and immenſity of his being, which the whole World could not contain, ſhew them what a vain and fooliſh thing it was in them, to think that any Houſe could be built that ſhould hold or contain him, or that he ſhould need, or be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Houſe that ſhould be ſet up for his Habitation (and indeed to this purpoſe doth <hi>Stephen</hi> cite this place, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.48. &amp;c.) yea, that he muſt needs be a Spirit, infinite in his Eſſence, and conſequently that he could only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Spiritual Service, and that therefore the meer outward pomp of a ſtately houſe, and Carnal Ceremonies, could never be the things that were pleaſing in his ſight; without a pure heart and a pure life, no Man can ſerve God acceptably; yea, and ſome think too, that under this is alſo imply'd, that there was a time coming, when this Temple-Services ſhould be utterly abbrogated, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 4.21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For all thoſe things hath mine hand made,</hi> &amp;c.] To wit, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Earth and all things therein; <hi>and all thoſe things have been, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is, they have had their being, or they have conſiſted (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.) or continued in their being, by my hand, by being upheld by my power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Now the drift of this is to ſhew, that ſince he made the World and all things therein, he needed not a Houſe to dwell in here, no more then he did from Eternity, before he made theſe things; and that if he did deſire a Houſe, ſurely he that manſions in Heaven and Earth, needed not to deſire them to build him an Houſe; ſee the Notes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.11, 12. <hi>but to this Man will I look;</hi> to wit, out of great reſpect, and out of my tender and provident care over him: Or, as to the Houſe and Temple where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will chooſe to dwell, <hi>even to him that is Poor and of a contrite Spirit;</hi> ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 57.15. and <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.16. <hi>and trembleth at my Word;</hi> that is, that fearing me, ſtands in awe of my Word, and dares not decline in the leaſt from what I have commanded him. It is as if the Lord had ſaid, though I be ſo infinitely great and high, and all ſufficient in my ſelf, yet I overlook all the World to caſt mine Eye upon theſe poor humble ones, and theſe are the Temple that I will dwell in.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe, is as if he ſlew a Man,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, ſay ſome, when Chriſt ſhall have put an end to the Legal Worſhip, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of theſe Sacrifices, will be as hateful to God, as the ſlaying of a Man would be; yea, and becauſe the Particle of ſimilitude <hi>(as)</hi> is not in the Hebrew, but it is there; <hi>He that killeth an Oxe, ſlayeth a Man, he that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth a Lamb, cutteth off a Dogs Neck,</hi> &amp;c. therefore ſome conceive that the <hi>Jews</hi> are charged here with this, that at the ſame time, when they Srcrificed Oxen and Lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God, according to Gods Law, they did alſo Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:42788:296"/>
Heathens did. But I make no queſtion but the words are beſt Rendred with a Note of Similitude, as it is in our Tranſlation; and that the ſcope of the place is to ſhew, that whilſt they were ſuch a wicked People, void of all true fear of God, their Sacrifices were not only things unacceptable, but even hateful and odious to him; ſee the Notes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.11. &amp;c. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe;</hi> to wit, for Sacrifice; <hi>is as if he ſlew a Man;</hi> that is, he doth that which I abhor as much as if he murdered a Man; or his killing an Oxe for Sacrifice, is no more pleaſing to me, than if he ſlew a Man for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as the Heathens are wont to do. For it may well be that in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (and ſo likewiſe in thoſe that follow) his drift is to ſhew, that the abominable Sacrifices of the Heathens were as acceptable to him, as theirs were; <hi>he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck,</hi> which was not only one of thoſe unclean Creatures, that might not be offered in Sacrifice (though the Heathens did) but always alſo eſteemed baſe and vile; inſomuch that whereas the Money that was taken for the Redemption of any unclean Beaſt might be brought into the Temples Treaſury, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.11. there was expreſs Order, that no price of a Dog ſhould be brought into Gods Houſe; ſee the Note, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.8. <hi>he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered Swines blood;</hi> Creatures ſo unclean, that they might not be eaten, or touched, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.7, 8. much leſs might they be offered in Sacrifice, as the Heathens did: <hi>he that burneth Incenſe, as if he bleſſed an Idol;</hi> that is, praiſed it, or prayed or ſacrificed to it; <hi>yea, they have choſen their own ways;</hi> that is, wittingly and knowingly they have choſen to walk in their own ways, rather than do what I commanded them; where by <hi>their own ways</hi> may be particularly meant their Will-worſhips, which were of their own deviſing, not of Gods appointment; or generally their ſinful, wicked ways, which alone were enough to make God abhor their Sacrifices. And ſo alſo may the laſt Clauſe be underſtood; <hi>and their Soul delighteth in their abominations.</hi> But ſee the Note alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>I alſo will chuſe their deluſions,</hi> &amp;c.] This hath reference to that which was ſaid in the cloſe of the foregoing Verſe; <hi>they have choſen their own ways:</hi> And ſo it is as if God had ſaid, They have made their choice, and ſo now I will make mine; they have choſen to do what they pleaſed with me, even thoſe things which I would not have had done; and now by way of retaliation, I will take what courſe I pleaſe with them, I will do to them what they would not have done. Some read it, <hi>I alſo will chuſe their devices,</hi> (as it is in the Margin) meaning the reward of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; they choſe to do what they liſt in my Worſhip, as if they were no way bound up to my Commands; and now I will chuſe to do what I pleaſe with them, as if I had no way engaged my ſelf by promiſe to them. But it is better rendered, as it is in our Bibles; <hi>I alſo will chuſe their deluſions;</hi> where by <hi>their deluſions</hi> may be meant (actively) the deluſions and mockeries which they put upon God; yea, and wherewith they deluded the World and themſelves too; in that they ſought to cover their Hypocriſie and Diſobedience and Rebellions againſt God with a ſhew of Piety, and a pretence that they aimed at the advancement of Gods Glory; or by <hi>their deluſions,</hi> may be meant (paſſively) the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:42788:296"/>
and mockages which they ſhould endure from others, and wherewith God would puniſh them for the other. So that both may be included, and ſo we may underſtand it thus: Becauſe they have thus vainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded themſelves, and wickedly ſought to delude me, by bringing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment upon them, I will diſcover their wickedneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring them to be mocked, deluded, and derided by others; <hi>and will bring their fears upon them;</hi> that is, thoſe terrors and affrightments which their ſins have deſerved; yet ſome hereby underſtand the Evils which they feared; to wit, that of being ruined by the Heathens, which by complying with them in their Idolatry they thought to prevent; <hi>becauſe when I called none did anſwer,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the the No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>As one whom his Mother comforteth, ſo will I comfort you,</hi> &amp;c.] As if he had ſaid, You ſhall not only be comforted by the Church your Mother, but I alſo will be to you as a tender Mother herein. For as an affectionate Mother is wont by kind ſpeeches, and by hugging and embracing her Child, and by all poſſible expreſſions of her love, to labour to quiet and ſtill it, and chear it up again, when it cries and weeps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome hurt it had taken, or becauſe ſhe had formerly chid it, or beaten it; ſo will I comfort you, my People, after I had for a time corrected you; <hi>and ye ſhall be comforted in</hi> Jeruſalem; that is, though <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> hath lain ſo long in ſuch a deſolate condition, yet ſhall her proſperous and flouriſhing Eſtate be matter of great comfort and rejoicing to you.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And when ye ſee this,</hi> &amp;c.] This is thus expreſſed, to imply the undoubted certainty of it; with their Eyes they ſhould ſee it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; <hi>your heart ſhall rejoice;</hi> that is, you ſhall rejoice heartily; <hi>and your bones ſhall flouriſh like an herb;</hi> that is, your Strength and Beauty ſhall be renewed, as it is with Herbs, that ſeeming dead and withered in the Winter, do in the Spring ſprout out freſhly again. Becauſe miſery and ſorrow do uſually waſte the ſtrength of men, making their very Bones to be dead and dry; ſee the Notes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4. and 17.22. and on the other ſide, chearfulneſs and joy do advance mens health, and fill their Bones with Juice and Marrow; ſee the Notes, <hi>Job</hi> 21.24. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.30. Hence it is, that to ſet forth how exceedingly they ſhould rejoice in the proſperous eſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he uſeth this expreſſion; <hi>your bones ſhall flouriſh like an Herb;</hi> Gods People were in <hi>Babylon</hi> like a company of dead and dry bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. but theſe dead Bones ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lively and moiſt and vigorous again; <hi>and the hand of the Lord ſhall be known towards his Servants, and his indignation towards his Enemies;</hi> that is, notice ſhall be taken of that, which in the time of your miſery you would not believe: Namely, that God hath done theſe things out of

his tender reſpect to you, and out of his indignation againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For behold, the Lord will come with Fire,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſaid in the cloſe of the foregoing Verſe, that the Lord would make known <hi>his indignation towards his Enemies;</hi> here he ſets forth in what a terrible manner he would fall upon them, uſing expreſſions that may ſeem to imply, that he would break forth upon them after the manner of ſome dreadful tempeſt (ſee the Notes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. and 97.3.) or elſe as a King marching out againſt his Enemies with a mighty and dreadful Army, as the mention of <hi>his Chariots</hi> here doth import; <hi>the Lord will come with Fire, and with his Chariots like a Whirle-wind;</hi> for which ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.28. <hi>to render his anger with Fury, and his rebuke with flames of Fire;</hi> that is, to puniſh them more ſharply and ſeverely than is uſually done; ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.25. Now this I know ſome underſtand of Gods coming in flaming Fire, to puniſh the wicked at the day of Judgment; (and it is true indeed, that then their puniſhment ſhall be fully accompliſhed) but this doth not ſo well ſuit with that which followeth in the next Verſe; <hi>and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many.</hi> However, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is primarily and principally meant of the vengeance executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi> (as is evident by the deſcription that is given of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.) by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> when they burnt up their City and Temple, and made ſuch havock amongſt the People; though we may well alſo take in that greater deſtruction that was likewiſe executed on them afterward by the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>For by Fire, and by his Sword, will the Lord plead with all Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, with Men and Women of all ſorts and ranks amongſt his People; for ſtill he ſpeaks of the ſame judgment, of which he ſpake in the foregoing Verſe; to wit, the deſtruction brought upon them by the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> Hitherto he had pleaded with them by his Meſſengers, the Prophets; but now he would plead with them in another manner, even by Fire and Sword; <hi>and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many;</hi> that is, the Lord ſhall ſlay many and many of them; their multitude ſhall not ſave them from his Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>They that ſanctifie themſelves, and purifie themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, that by waſhing, and other ſuperſtitious Rites, do think to make themſelves holy and pure; <hi>in the Gardens;</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.29. <hi>behind one Tree in the midſt;</hi> that is, behind ſome one eminent Tree in the midſt of the Gardens, ſet apart for that ſervice of waſhing and purifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet ſome would rather have the meaning to be this, that they did it every one behind his own Tree, about the midſt of their Gardens made choice of for their own peculiar uſe; as they had every one his own peculiar God, ſo they would have a peculiar Tree, under which they would ſerve him. Well, but then the words may be rendered (as they are in the Margin) <hi>one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another;</hi> and then the meaning may be, either that they purified and waſhed themſelves <hi>one after another</hi> (as thinking it was the more religiouſly

done, when they did in that manner) <hi>in the midſt;</hi> that is, openly in the midſt of many, that ſtood about them when they did it; wherein there might be much of laſciviouſneſs, a ſin uſual amongſt Idolaters; or elſe that they flocked in to the performance of their Idolatrous rites; <hi>one after another;</hi> to wit, by great Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Troops, out of their great zeal for the Service of their Idol-gods; <hi>eating Swines fleſh;</hi> to wit, as ſome think, after they had offered it in Sacrifice; but ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 65.4. <hi>and the abomination;</hi> whereby ſome think is meant, that which had been ſacrificed to Idols, others any meat forbidden by the Law; and others again, becauſe this is placed here between two diſtinct kinds of unclean Beaſts, would have it, that by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Shekets</hi> here uſed, ſome particular kind of unclean Beaſts is intended; <hi>and the Mouſe;</hi> expreſly forbidden to be eaten, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.29. <hi>ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed together, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ſee the Note, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.28.</p>

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:42788:299"/>
or a Holy Life and Converſation, according to the Rule of the Goſpel; or, that inward Seal of Gods Sanctifying Spirit, whereby they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from counterfeits; ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Or rather, Gods appointing them to be ſaved, and his watchful providence over them for their preſervation, which ſhould be as ſure a means of ſafeguarding them from the common deſtruction, as if there had been a ſign or mark ſet upon them for that end and purpoſe; <hi>and I will ſend thoſe that eſcape of them;</hi> that is, thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> thus preſerved; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nations;</hi> to wit, to Preach the Goſpel to them; <hi>to</hi> Tarſhiſh, Pul, and Lud, <hi>that draw the Bow, to</hi> Tubal <hi>and</hi> Javan, &amp;c. for the underſtanding whereof, we muſt know, 1. That by <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> may be meant <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> or ſome other remote place; or the Ocean Sea in general; and ſo the meaning might be, that they ſhould go forth both by Sea and Land, to Preach the Goſpel.

is before noted upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.3.) rotted, and ſo full of of crawling Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Worms, and Maggots, and not fit therefore to be removed and carried away, but only to be burnt up with Fire; and this I judge the more probable, becauſe it is clear, that theſe Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi> were thoſe that he had before threatened, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17. Or, 2.

Or, 3. of the Saints and Servants of God in the days of the Goſpel, brought in from among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (of whom indeed he had ſpoken in the foregoing Verſes,) to wit, that they having been brought into ſome ſtraits by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould after they had recovered their Liberty again, go forth and look upon that woful ſpectacle of the Carcaſes of their Enemies, lying in ſuch a rueful and horrid manner, as was before deſcribed. But now withall we muſt know, that many learned Expoſitors do underſtand this (very probably, I conceive) of any notable judgments of God, which the Righteous ſhould ſee executed upon wicked ungodly wretches, for their Idolatries, profaneneſs, and contempt of the Goſpel: Only theſe judgments and executions of divine Vengeance upon wicked Men are figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſet forth, by way of reſembling them to that dreadful ſpectacle of a company of dead Corps, that lye rotting and ſtinking above ground, full of crawling Worms, and ſo putrified, that there was no touching them, they were only fit to be burnt with Fire; and yet, becauſe of their multitude and putrifaction, were like to be very long burning, ere they would be conſumed. <hi>And they ſhall go forth and look upon upon the Carcaſes of the Men that have tranſgreſſed againſt me, for their Worm ſhal not die, neither ſhall their Fire be quenched.</hi> And indeed this figurative deſcription of the judgments and vengeance of God upon wicked Men, is therefore the fitter; 1. Becauſe wicked and ungodly Men, void of all Grace and Spiritual Life, are no better than the ſtinking Carcaſes of Men, dead whilſt they live, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Let the dead bury their dead,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.22. And, 2. becauſe a main part of that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which God pours forth upon wicked Men, conſiſts in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments and terrours of conſcience, wherewith they are uſually tortured, as with a Worm alway gnawing on their Hearts, and a Fire alway burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within their boſoms, partly here in this World, but eſpecially after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Hell to all Eternity; for hereto doth our Saviour expreſly apply this paſſage of our Prophet, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.43, 44. As for the laſt Clauſe, <hi>and they ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh;</hi> it may be underſtood, both of their being loathed here in this World, by <hi>all fleſh;</hi> that is, all People that ſhould behold the ſad diſcovery of Gods wrath againſt them in that horrid condition wherein they lay, and likewiſe eſpecially of their being abhorred by all that ſhall be Eye-witneſſes of their extream and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſery at the day of Judgment.</p>
